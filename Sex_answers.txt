Here is a link and you can read all about it.\nOther Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "Age is not a factor as to why a girl would get cervical cancer. A girl's chance increases 85% to getting cervical cancer after the FIRST sexual partner mainly because males are asymptomatic carriers of HPV 16 and 18. HPV strains 16 and 18 are the precursor to cervical cancer and in males there are zero symptoms or indications he is a carrier. This day and age a lot of girls begin to be sexually active younger and younger which is why the HPV vaccine is suggested at age 11-12 for all children in the hopes they are reached before sexual activity.\nCervical cancer forms slowly over time but fortunately has many signs and symptoms in women that can be treated if caught in time. One symptom is called strawberry cervix and can be an easy visual confirmation that there is something wrong and to begin treatment. That's why yearly pap smears and cervical exams are so important once a girl begins to have sex. Unfortunately girls do not regularly get cervical exams and cancer gone unchecked will only lead to one thing, death.\nSo, honestly age is only a concern as to when to vaccinate and not a factor in getting cervical cancer. Either way if you are going to be sexually active get vaccinated AND/OR get regular exams. Bottom line is cervical cancer is a completely preventable illness.", "It's not SEX that causes cancer, nor is it to do with her age. That's just not true. Cervical cancer can be caused by human papilloma virus or HPV, otherwise known as plain old WARTS. Warts are a mutation of the cells, and in some cases the mutation leads to a cancerous growth. On the cervix, this is cervical cancer.\nSex, with an infected partner of course, might transmit the HPV virus to the vagina and cervix, anus, mouth and throat, and penis. So it can lead to cancer in any of these parts.\nFortunately we now have a vaccine for HPV, which protects against the 9 most dangerous strains of the virus. But it's a VACCINE not a CURE. If you have already been exposed to any of the strains of HPV (most sexually active adults have contracted several strains) it's too late. Like herpes, warts are forever! The virus cannot be cured, only treated.\nThe best solution therefore is to vaccinate young people before they become sexually active. Before they are ever exposed to the virus. If every young man and woman was vaccinated, they believe the incidences of cervical cancer would be significantly reduced! Possibly even eliminated!\nSo it's not about the act of sex! With condoms you are protected from STDs anyway, for the most part. It's actually all about the common wart! So before you decide to go get laid, get vaccinated, and you'll reduce your cancer risk significantly!"], "no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 3, "name_list": ["Jay Dusty", "Amy Laine", "Amy Oakes"], "view_list": [9, 62, 115], "upvote_list": [0, 4, 14]}, "278": {"topic_list": ["One-Night Stands", "Casual Sex", "Bollywood", "Sex"], "no_of_view": "295", "question_title": "Is it true that Bollywood acctrees are available for one night?", "question_author": "Karan Pilley", "date_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "ans_list": [], "no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "view_list": [], "upvote_list": []}, "644": {"topic_list": ["Virginity and Virgins", "Sex Advice", "Adult Dating and Relationships", "Sex", "Personal Question"], "no_of_view": "664", "question_title": "My girlfriend and I both really badly want to have sex.

There is no evidence that a divine being exists. If one does, it had no problem with extreme human suffering for virtually all of the time people have been around, which is at least 300,000 to 400,000 years. 50% of children born would die before reaching puberty. 1/4 of all children born died before reaching their 1st birthday. This was the situation even in developed countries untell about 140 years ago. What kind of loving merciful God would allow that to happen? It is only through science and medicine that we are saving women's and children's lives.\nThe truth is that religious people have been extreamly hung up about sex since the beginning. Women were seen as property of either their fathers or their husbands. One way wealth was measured was by the number of children one had, because 1st of all, many would die, and secondly, many hands were needed to work. Who cares if your kids die, there are more where those came from.\nHomosexuality has always existed and is even seen in other animals. There are many theories about the survival benefit of homosexuality. One is that many parents died before their children were old enough to take care of themselves. When a parent, particularly a father, died, the child needed someone to take care of and support it until adulthood. Most parents were overrun trying to provide for children of their own. Homosexual uncles, who would tend to have few if any children, could raise their siblings\u2019 children, thereby ensuring survival of at least some of their genes, since siblings get their genes from the same parents.\nSo. God doesn't give a flip about your sexuality. Humans do. Humans who have wanted to control other people, dictating to them what they can and can't do even in the most personal area of their lives.\nIf you notice, in the Christian Bible, Jesus says absolutely nothing about homosexuality. Diddley-squat. Obviously, an issue which did not concern him. In the Old Testament, which Christians got from Jews, there is a verse instructing men not to lie with other men as with a woman. However, this is in the midst of a bunch of other rules, including prohibiting the consumption of pork and shellfish, telling people not to wear clothes of mixed fibers, and many other rules which virtually all Christians feel are completely OK to ignore. Unfortunately, theocrats who oppose religious freedom, who want to dictate what happens in the bedrooms of everyone else,, have focused on this and use it as a litmus test, thereby showing that they don't really care what Jesus says, as long as they have an excuse to try to control other people.\nIf you come from a Muslim or Hindu perspective or even a Jewish one, I am far less versed in what those religious documents say.

With the Hebrew, it makes a lot more sense - we know that a lot of the mesopotamian religions used ritual sex as a form of worship, and the Israelites very much wanted to distance themselves from the religions of their neighbours."], "no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["Dixie L.

The images below attest to the tremendous creativity of these Asian cultures, giving us such wonders as the Kama Sutra (a delightful how-to manual about having sex).\nKandariya Mahadeva Temple. Erotic Group. Circa 1000-1030 CE. Khajuraho (Madhya Pradesh, India), Candella Dynasty.\nAnonymous. Kumari and King in Coitus: Illustration from the Kama Sutra. Late 18th century. Bhaktapur, Nepal. Pigments on paper.\nAnonymous. Kumari and King in Coitus: Illustration from the Kama Sutra. Late 18th century. Bhaktapur, Nepal. Pigments on paper.\nKitagawa Utamaro. Prelude to Desire. 1799 (from an album of 12 erotic Shunga woodcuts). Ink on paper.\nGiulio Romano. Love Scene (The Lovers). 1524-25. Oil on canvas, transferred from panel.\nFrom the 14th to the 18th centuries, Europe enjoyed a flourishing of artistic activity. This period is known as the Renaissance (meaning rebirth). Artists looked to the ancient world for inspiration. The amazing, lifelike appearance of Ancient Greek and Roman artworks allowed artists like Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian and Brunelleschi to reach new heights of naturalism.\nAntonio da Correggio. Leda and the Swan. 1531-1532. Oil on canvas.\nAgnolo Bronzino. Exposure of Luxury: Allegory with Venus, Cupid and Time. 1546. Oil on wood panel.\nJacques Louis David. Cupid and Psyche (L'Amour et Psych\u00e9). 1817. Oil on canvas.\nAs the Late Enlightenment drew to a close (around 1800), the Modern Era was well under way. Masters such as Pissarro, Manet, Degas, David and Courbet achieved breathtaking levels of beauty and realism with their work. The human form, in all its naked splendour, became lifelike to a degree that would not be challenged until Kodak perfected colour photography (over 100 years later, in 1935).\nAdvancements in the chemistry and production of oil-based paints allowed gorgeous flesh tones and vivid colours to vibrate on canvas, breathing new life into the art of painting. Here, some of the most erotic interpretations of Classical mythology are born, leading inevitably to sensual vignettes of a far more personal nature.\nGustave Courbet. The Origin of the World. 1866. Oil on canvas.\nGustav Klimt. Danae. 1907-1908. Oil on canvas\nAuguste Rodin. The Kiss. 1886. Marble.\nMeanwhile, Rodin and other sculptors explored the expressive potential of bronze, stone, clay and wood. A slow but steady evolution was taking place that would see the emergence of abstraction and non-objective art.\nThe 20th century heralded the inevitable supplanting of naturalism as the loftiest of artistic achievements. Abstraction became the new watch-word for Van Gogh, Gauguin, Picasso, Dali, Mondrian, Matisse, Kandinsky and a host of other artists.\nJudy Chicago. Georgia O'Keeffe Plate #1. 1979. China paint on ceramic.\nThomas Hill (collector). AIDS Awareness Poster, with man and woman inside large condom. 1995 (Australia). Photolithography.\nNever satisfied, creative souls continually searched for new ways to express ideas. Video, colour photography and, somewhat later, computer-aided image manipulation provided artists with the tools to realize a universe of exciting, new imagery.\nThis brings us to present day and the mind-boggling creations of thousands of visual artists around the world who explore political, philosophical, social and personal issues. Some of the most exciting and challenging artworks \u2014 dealing with gender, identity, desire and belonging \u2014 are being created at this very moment. Many of these artworks may appear strange or confusing at first glance, mostly because naturalism and realism are no longer expected (nor are they needed to say what needs to be said).\nEvelin Stermitz. ArtFem.TV Art and Feminism ITV\n, December 27, 2008. Video still.\nZackary Canepari. A head of a 'Real Doll' lies in a box at the San Marcos headquarters of Real Dolls.

You can catch sexually transmitted infection on your unprotected sex.\nBesides that, you need to ask your partner if they are ok with you cumming in their mouth - otherwise if you do ejaculate into their mouth without permission, it is a non-consensual act. Agreeing to give a blow job is not the same thing as agreeing for you to ejaculate in their mouth.

If you are the receiver of a blow job, receive fully as best as possible (including telling your body to relax and receive), give feedback (in complimentary ways) and express gratitude and appreciation (so it is a positive experience for both for you).

Being caressed feels so much better than getting your head wrenched around or getting choked, unless of course your into that.\nAs with all things, communication is important and sex is no different. If something feels good, you can let your partner know through words, sounds or actions. Same thing if something feels uncomfortable. Attentive and caring lovers want to know how their partner is feeling and appreciate intimate guidance. Communication makes it better for both of you.\nWhen your close to cumming, it's a good idea to give your partner a \u201cheads up\". If they're reading your body they'll likely already know but cum in the eye stings, so I'm told. A simple \u201cI'm going to cum\" will do but be as creative as you like. And do be mindful of that choking thing again.\nIf it's not working out, don't force it. Relax. Try something else for a while, something you both enjoy. The mood may turn around. Or you can save it for another time. No pressure.\nIf it isn't working out for you, a caring partner would likely want to know why, especially since you communicated your likes. It's a fair question, deserving an answer. If it's because you're nervous, say that. If your partner isn't getting it just right, offer gentle guidance. Whatever the honest answer is, I would deliver it with loving kindness.\nWhether it's horribly clumsy or toe-curling, timeless bliss, the experience you share is what you two make of it. I wish you both the latter.\nP.S.\nYour partner just focused on your pleasure. If it were me, I'd return the favor.", "Yes. It is an act of love and of passion. Major advice is to be affectionate, maybe serious foreplay as before intercourse, then just enjoy it. But be passive, allow her/him to set the pace. Do not make the common mistake that your lover is doing it only for your pleasure\u2026it is a very intense experience for both of you, And should be followed by loving aftercare.", "Your knees might get a little wobbly or weak, mainly during orgasm. If they know what they are doing, it will be a very intense experience. You might make a few weird noises during this, most likely during orgasm. Don\u2019t sweat it. some love it and are turned on by the sounds. while your sperm is pumping out into their mouth, you will need to slow down, so tell them while you are in your nut, please go slowly. Your butt will squeeze too, and some like their butts squeezed and rubbed by the person giving the blow job. You might make sure they don\u2019t mind you holding their head, running your fingers through their hair, maybe pulling on it just a little, so ask. I hate being interrupted with a passion, and you will too, so make sure you have privacy and time to complete the project. I\u2019ve been caught in blow job before, and it\u2019s very unpleasant. Good blowers know how to roll their tongue around your penis head gently and draw it out while it throbs. they should also know to make your penis head wet first, not just dive in. You might also want to hold your penis in their mouth while you finish your nut, and let it throb in their mouth a little before pulling it out. You need to tell them that if that\u2019s what you want to do. I had one person pull their mouth off after the first couple of squirts, and it still kept squirting. Also if they like it, you might hold your sperm in for a few days so they\u2019ll get a big load. You don\u2019t have to, but some like that, giving and receiving. I held back once for a month and pumped lots and lots of sperm in their mouth, and they loved it, and I sure did, but not everyone does. Some don\u2019t want any cum at all and want to stop and let you jack when you cum. Lastly it\u2019s a big turn on for me when the person blowing me is rubbing off and hopefully cums too, while I cum, but that\u2019s me. I eat pussy so much so it\u2019s part of my turn on if she cums too.", "This is one of those ridiculous questions of quora.\nPrepare for a blow job\u2026\nWell, let me say, you don't prepare for blow job, you just receive it.\nBut you can get a breakfast of 6 eggs with white bred and milk shake, then run 15 miles, wear blue jeans and white shirt, make sure you pop in to the local market, buy some fish for dinner, and the list goes on.

A few examples of coping mechanisms often seen witin the coping mechanism of narcissism itself, are the need to be in control, perfectionism, lying, fantasising, testing other people\u2019s responses, exerting power over another person.

These coping mechanisms simply don\u2019t stop at the bedroom door; unhealthy levels of coping mechanisms and unhealthy coping mechanisms keep creeping up on the continuum in all areas of life, including sexuality.

A person can love anyone and he/she can have sex with his/her lover (only if both of them are comfortable), and it's their choice.. I agree!\nIf a girl is wearing a bikini or showing her chest and her body and is not a virgin, then, no one has the right to judge her personality. Because not neccessary that a girl who is a virgin and covers her dress and is very \u201cSanskari\" ll be a nice wife, nice mother, nice daughter, etc.\nNow about sex outside marraige n all, it's actually a shameful act in my opinion!\nSome people say that sex outside marraige, couples exchanging is nothing wrong and people need to change their mind as it is 21st century!! As I have already said in my other answers, they have some mental problems! That's it.\nNow a days, people are wearing short dresses, people are dating before marraige, people are loosing their virginty before marraige, girls are getting educated and independent, etc, etc..as they have every freedom and society have no right to judge them..I strongly agree with this! People have every freedom and society have no rights to judge them!\nBut freedom means\u2026they are free to fall in love, they are free to loose their virginty if they feel so, they are free to wear anything(short dresses, etc), they are free to earn, etc! But..if a person ll kill another person\u2026you cannot say that a person is free to murder anyone if he/she likes! Will You? NO!\nThis is the sad truth actually! People have taken the word \u201cFreedom\u201d in a wrong way. And now they have just lost their mind. That's it!\nAnd, there is nothing to worry. After many years, people ll say \u201cif there is nothing wrong by eating chicken, goat, fish, etc, then there is nothing wrong by eating a HUMAN..\u201d.\n*(I actually believe in god, reincarnation, heaven and hell and ages(yugas)..and we all know thats it's kaliyug(age of dark) now.. And you can see in youtube about kaliyug..it has already said that one time ll come when human 'll eat another human.\nLuckily we are in good stage now(golden age of kaliyug)..so we are not facing such type of stupid people always (though we face them but not always)....but after approx 5000 years from now..golden age ll end..And these type of people ll be everywhere..)*.\nSo those people who are saying sex outside marraige is not wrong and all and are saying if one person is married to another person, doesn\u2019t mean that person ll have sex with that person.. that person can have sex with anyone..the main problem is with them! Not with us(who are opposing this).\nAnd in my opinion..there are known as murkhs(fools)..\nChanakya\u2019s Neeti says that \u201cits baseless to argue with a foolish person\u201d. And it's true. These foolish people ll waste their energy by justifying that whatever useless thing they are doing is not wrong..so it's better for us to step back from them!\nI hope, one day..there will be a strict law for these fools. Once, we all know..200, 300 years ago from now.. how women were torchured by men, etc..and how people of those days used to say \u201cThere is nothing wrong if we beat a woman and if society thinks that woman are like man then they should change their thinking\u201d..Just like how these loosers are saying now \u201csex outside marraige is not wrong and society needs to change their thinking\u201d. But now, there is a law for those men who are torchuring a woman..if a man beats a woman..he is send to jail.

But it took me a bit time to hit at oral sex. Unfortunately, my first experience was horrible as I couldn't bear the foul smell n taste , it was absolutely disgusting!!! And just to pleasure him I used to do it but down inside my heart I extremely hated it. The thought of oral sex itself used to haunt me. I didn't want to make him feel bad so I never told him. Few of my female friends shared their experience n I got to know only my case was odd. I researched more on this n learnt he wasn't washing it properly everyday. The smegma used to get accumulated resulting into foul smell.\nI couldn't imagine how could he even think of asking for it if he knew he wasn't cleaning it. How can someone not at all care about the partner who is giving oral only to pleasure you. I discussed regarding this n thankfully he started maintining his hygiene.

Who cares? Are you happy? Plus I heard hoes make great gfs. Kinda like eating chips somewhere quiet. Everyone is looking at you funny, but they know they want some.\nLol. Maybe her experience will pay off :).", "Hi. What Trevor Said and more.\nI think you are feeling this, not actually experiencing this with the previous guys?\nIts normal, real, and it sucks. After those truths, add new truths.\nLike; it works both ways. Your partner has to deal with the same knowledge and possible involuntary thoughts. Even if you've only had one partner, the same insecurity can surface.\nDemand yourself to control your thoughts. The thoughts may come but believe it or not you really do have the choice whether to dwell on them. You really do have the mental authority to shut the thoughts up. But first you have to do that. They will not go away on their own. Your brain is waiting to follow your instruction.\nBe A Boss \ud83d\ude42\nListen, we don't realize that in everything we do we are instructing our behavior. Every moment of our lives. And most moments are new to us, so again, we are constantly analyzing and instructing our behavior.\nNow, this new situation is far more advanced than any other you've experienced. Then to make it worse\u2026 all these new uninvited emotions show up. For years the decisions you've had to navigate had little to do with emotions other than joy or disappointment.\nNow, like everything, the stakes are raised. Now you're dealing with negative emotions. As good as time as any to Google Emotional Behavior.\nKnowledge truly is power. You'll learn that jealousy is not a normal emotion. It's a negative thought process that is abnormal and will not only become addictive, but will become an illness. An illness that will control you, as any addiction will. And all because you didn't know that you can control your thoughts.\nOk, and like how you don't know that past sexual relationships really don't matter to anyone except the person worrying about it.\nEach new relationship with a person is the only one. Adding sex to that relationship is the same. Absolutely KNOW that if a partner is staying with you, they only think of you.\nAnd her prior partners have moved on too. They don't think of her emotionally or sexually. Just like you don't think of your past partners. If you and your gf run into one of your past partners you do not think of her in any way, right?\nUnless you've remained friends. And then you definitely don't think of her sexually, right?\nSo see, all my talk about controlling your own mind really is relevant. Control your mind to acknowledge and accept these truths I've just mentioned.\nBut\u2026 You still want to be real about certain inevitable situations. I get it. These moments and interactions will occur. You will run into these guys. You will think things. This is when you practice your new mental exercises!\nYou've heard of Be In The Moment, and Mindfulness? Now you know what they really mean\u2026. you will immediately instruct yourself to be in the moment. No one is thinking about the past, but you. Physically practice snapping your fingers every time you become insecure or jealous. Then instantly do that in a situation that feels compromising. Remembering that it can only be compromising if you are allowing it to be by not Being Present, in the moment.\nCall yourself to realize that truly no one is thinking about her in bed or whatever. No one is thinking anything because they are in the moment also, with whatever is going on.\nOk, what if a past dude or dudes together, actually do what you've been fantasizing about and laugh while looking at the 2 of you.\n2 things\u2026 It is either a very brief laugh and likely something like is portrayed in the movies\u2026 When they briefly are actually laughing with you about you being the lucky one now, or you being the one who finally got her to stick around.\nIn other words just a normal joking thing not meant at all in a derogatory way. You'll know by how they behave with you. If they don't actually engage with you later because it's not something they normally do, all the better.\nIf they are real losers and continue to talk smack, loudly and intentionally, KNOW THIS \u2026 They are not actually thinking of her sexually. You can't be 2 places. And they are in the moment of hating on you. Period. Even if their exact words are about being with her, they physically can't be thinking of the actual sex with her. Google Physics \ud83d\ude09 Its impossible.\nBut still\u2026. what about the fact that they are intentionally effing with you so that you WILL feel hurt and mad. This is where my and Trevor's advice meet up.\nSTAY IN YOUR MOMENT. FOCUS. CONTROL. and control the situation in whatever scenario is called for. Laugh it off, laugh with pride and your own smack. Laugh and begin a new subject like what's up with them.\nI can also immediately imagine scenarios where you need to say something. SAY SOMETHING. or Walk Away, say Oh it's like that and let them know they are dismissed from your life and your thoughts, as of now. If called for make a pitiful look their way and laugh yourself, then Move On. Back to being in the moment.\nBecause, Remember\u2026 Whatever you instruct your brain to do it will.\nAnd just like jealousy was attempting to do , controlling your thoughts will become the new behavior that your brain responds to automatically.\nTruly, everything is science. Be your boss and candidate of your neurology.\nLastly, don't just think this next thought and dismiss it in temporary favor of feeling bad, know it, know that there truly is only one reason losers do what they do, JEALOUSY. Not being in control of THEIR minds. Period.\nNow add the second powerful tool to being in the moment\u2026 Gratitude.\nBe grateful for your moment with your girl. Right now. There's no room for other's negative psyches in your moments. Peace, thanks for listening and learning.", "Because you are thinking about it.

I explained how stimulation made the sperm come and that's what got girls pregnant. She said she wanted to see so I helped her jerk me off and when I felt it rising I said watch this. Then I pointed my penis at the sand and let her milk me while I shot six or seven hard spurts. I never took her virginity because she wasn't ready for that yet but at a later time I gave her her first orgasm.

Setting a year period is reasonable and responsible. If you are still together at the end, it will indicate a committed and caring relationship.\nI think that it is reasonable for you to discuss your desires to stay together (and have sex at the end of the year) with your parents, assuming that they will themselves be reasonable.\nOnly your can determine that for sure, but let me tell you about my younger sister\u2019s experience with her boyfriend when she was a junior in high school, age 17.\nOur mother had gotten her an invitation to the Annapolis Naval Academy year-end prom. She met an academy junior at the dance and they began seeing each other when he was able to. They developed a real interest in each other. Soon, Marcia went to our mom and told her that she and Jim wanted to have sex.\nMom and dad knew Jim by that time. Dad had been a Marine in the Pacific during WW II. He admired Jim for going to the Academy and doing well. Dad said that Jim was an OK guy for Marcia to see.\nMom asked Marcia to wait for six months before doing anything. She told Marcia that if, at the end of six months, she and Jim were still seeing each other and wanted to have sex, then mom would take Marcia to a gynecologist and get her fitted for a diaphragm. Jim would be welcome to come to our house and stay in Marcia\u2019s bedroom. Dad looked favorably on this arrangement, but I suspect that that was only because he admired Jim and considered him a responsible man who would treat Marcia well.\nThat\u2019s what happened. Jim came to stay on weekends when he could get a pass, and on holidays and for the summer. His parents lived in Panama at the time. They did not expect him to come to them for the summer.\nHe did not tell them he was having sex with Marcia though. He said they would never understand and that his dad would freak out. The summer after his graduation, his parents came to visit. He moved all his things out of their bedroom and into our brother\u2019s old room. His parents stayed a couple of weeks in my old room and Jim slept in Richard\u2019s old room. Mom and dad went along with the ruse.\nMarcia and Jim stayed together. They were married for 35 years.\nThe point being that since you are being adult about it, perhaps your parents will be too. Perhaps they will welcome your boyfriend to sleep with you in your home. After all, better their than in the backseat of some car or in a motel room which you can tell them if you decided to talk with them about it.\nIn any event, practice safe sex. For God\u2019s sake, use effective birth control. You do not want to be pregnant at 17\u201320. It will ruin your life. And, don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that an abortion will be available to you if you need one. In the first place, legislatures are getting very nasty about restricting its availability. In the second, even if it\u2019s available, making the decision is one of the most painful and heart-wrenching experiences a woman can have \u2014 no matter which way she decides. You may not think so now, but, if you are ever faced with that choice, you will remember that I said don\u2019t go there.\nQ:\nThe age of consent in my country is 15 and I am 16 now. I have a boyfriend and he agreed that we should have sex when we have dated for at least a year, when we will both be 17. Is this okay?", "That sounds okay to me. You have my permission, for whatever that\u2019s worth. Sarcasm aside, only you can say when you are ready for sex.

You just better know that you have a chance of loosing whatever you have going with the mother if you get caught, you have a chance of ruining a mother daughter relationship for eternity and you need to think of the long haul. Where is it possibly going to go? If you keep sleeping with her, you\u2019ll eventually want to be with her or not and either is a lose in a way because you\u2019ll be stuck with one of them in your life - an angry mother for being a cheater or an angry daughter for not leaving the mother for her.

There are young men who think that they\u2019ll lose \u201cvital proteins\u201d or \u201clife energy\u201d if they masturbate. Others think that it will make them impotent. Young women want to know if they\u2019ll still be virgins if they masturbate, or if touching their own genitals could give them an STI.

Great sex starts with a knowledge of your own body, and this lesson is particularly important for girls.

Meaningless sex just makes you hollow and empty from inside while love completes you.\nNow don't get me wrong here, sex is an important aspect in one's love life.\nBut, is sex the reason why you smile in the middle of the day without any reason, get strength to overcome difficult situations in life, feel a sense of belonging even when you are physically alone for sometime, feel this life worth living, feel excited till you meet him or her again, feel immense joy at doing little sacrifices for that person? No right?\nIt's love that keeps you moving and happy in the long run. You can live without sex but a life without love feels rather empty. At one stage of life, we may even not feel the sexual urge anymore but love is endless. True love goes on as long as time and so does the joy it brings with it.

In an effort to please God, some fundamentalists are acting exactly like the scribes and pharisees that Christ spoke against, in being experts in the laws of God on one hand, but adding to God\u2019s words on the other. They ignored rather pertinent parts, which he reminded them of. They added rule upon rule upon rule, so much so that many people were in despair to know, remember, and keep all of their made-up rules and regulations, all because they wanted to impress God.\nSo now we have fundamentalist preachers, in an effort to please God, supposedly experts at their bible, and boasting of NOT being \u201cunder the law\u201d but under grace, then making up new rules and laws and regulations, adding to the words of God, and ignoring really pertinent parts of the bible, which Christ tries to remind them of (and they ignore).\nThings like this are for the PREACHER\u2019S image, NOT the \u201csoul\u201d of the people they preach to. It is for their ego. It is so they can be known as a strict, God-fearing, rule-following, righteous, upstanding, holy, pious, sanctified and upstanding Christian that everyone else on earth is supposed to sit down and make themselves feel impressed by. Making up rules against masturbation, based on very vague and ambiguous parts of the bible, and rather viciously condemning others who do not follow their made-up rules and laws (or in some places, \u201ctraditions\u201d) is directly against scripture. NO one is supposed to add to the word of God, or take away from it. There is a fine line between adding to and taking away, and \u201cediting\u201d and \u201cinterpreting\u201d.\nNow I say all that to say that this anti-masturbation attitude is against nature, against the normal way the human body (that God created) functions. It is also the only sane way to cope with sexual urges without falling into sexual sin, which is called \u201cadultery\u201d, which is an umbrella term for fornication, incest, homosexuality, and bestiality. If a person wants to follow the bible, then they have to follow the bible, not things a preacher made up and added to it in order to appear \u201choly\u201d to everyone else. The attitude is exactly the same as the scribes and pharisees that made people\u2019s lives miserable in Christ\u2019s day.\nI am speaking as someone who used to counsel, long ago, in a religious setting, and know what people say and feel about this, but would not dare speak out in church or to their family. Most anti-masturbation freaks masturbate, and know they are making other people\u2019s lives (mainly their children) miserable, but have to keep up that image and phony front. They know very well it\u2019s unnatural to hold in their sexual needs and urges, and some really believe that God will be pleased with this.\nTeenagers, in general, with extremely few exceptions, are not going to be little monks and nuns. Even REAL monks and nuns aren\u2019t always perfect. It is stupid and nearly brain-dead to actually expect this, no matter how much a preacher rants and froths about it. I know about the various means teenagers have tried to get around the anti-masturbation rules, and the numerous ways to \u201cnot really\u201d masturbate while masturbating.

Is this exclusive to gays/lesbians? Can a heterosexual woman be a \"top\" to her man?\nTop and bottom typically refer to roles during sex or BDSM play. The \u201ctop\u201d is the person performing the action and the \u201cbottom\u201d is the receiver. When referring to gay men, it refers specifically to whether they are the giver or receiver of anal sex and generally does not refer to other sexual acts.\nIn a vanilla heterosexual relationship, those terms typically are not used since it\u2019s usually assumed that the male will be doing the penetrating while the female receives penetration. Of course, there are plenty of people who are into pegging so it\u2019s quite possible for the female to be the top and the male to be the bottom.\nIn reference to BDSM, it can refer to the one on the performing or receiving end of any action. A rope top would be a person who likes tying other people up and/or suspending people with rope. A rope bottom would be the person who is getting tied up/suspended. In impact play, the top would be the person who is doing the hitting/spanking while the bottom is the one getting hit/spanked. Top and bottom roles could even change throughout a BDSM scene.\nThey are also sometimes conflated with D/s roles. Many people see top = Dom and bottom = sub. When used in this manner, \u201ctop\u201d would refer to the person in charge of the relationship and \u201cbottom\u201d would refer to the more submissive or passive member of the relationship. I prefer to keep those separate and distinct since you could be bottoming for a given action yet still be in charge of what is going on (and thus be the Dom).\nAs you can hopefully see, top and bottom are not strictly tied to gender no matter which context you\u2019re using it in. Also, ideas like which partner is more \u201cfeminine\u201d or \u201cmasculine\u201d do not dictate which partner is the top or bottom, whether we\u2019re talking about a homosexual or heterosexual relationship.\nFor more info on BDSM, feel free to join the Facebook group Humanistic BDSM: Inclusive AF Kink\n.

Also, Watch you calories, look at back of food packet and count your calories. you are supposed to eat 2000 in a day. keep a measure of how much you are eating. Try to get as low body fat as possible.\nAnother thing is: dont apply too much pressure in masturbation or masturbate too much as that can damage the 3 spongy chambers of the penis so it doesnt fill with blood properly.

Some people have done trials for themselves and have had mixed results which is expected anyway on this. Men\u2019s semen can have up to several mcg of B12 in haptocorrin at up to 200 times the concentration of blood. So what we know; oral mucosa can absorb B12 in an hour. There are some TCR-Li in mouth that can absorb and get to brain in 5 minutes. TCR-Li can keep 10 mg of injected MeCbl in the blood for up to 18 hours by not allowing it to be excreted by the kidneys. The placenta grows TCR-Li for pregnancy.`\nSo the question is do you have enough lithium and does the vaginal mucosa grow TCR-Li or can it be inspired to grow the TCR? That can absorb it fast enough that it could keep you awake via an increased B12 transferred to the brain. If that is the case, then you might consider taking some MeCbl sublinguals. If the TCR-Li is topped off and stays that way pretty much, having a few more mcg of B12 makes no difference.\nIf there it is never satisfied need and gives morning (not at night to keep you awake) stimulation, then I might suggest that some Lithium Orotate (5 mg) will help grow more receptors and when there is enough that it stores enough for days at a time the few more mcg makes no feelable difference.\nIf you do that and need more B12 it could very well have been delaying lots of healing and has a backlog to heal. That can cause additional symptoms. See the lists of symptoms in the below post.\nFred Davis's answer to Has someone used a MeCbl treatment for patients or has been treated with MeCbl?

Well my 1st wife wasn't a virgin when we met, actually she was already married at the time for about 4 or 5 months. She was a middle child & really wanted & needed attention but her younger sister by a year was the \u201cgolden child\". And she also was getting prepared to get married to her 1st love,yeah,the storybook stuff,we all should have a chance at. So my 1st wife , decides to get married 9 weeks after her Highschool graduation,she chose a halfa-homo, who basically needed a \u201cbeard\" during the 80s, being a homosexual wasn't as fashionable as it is now. This bloating, balding, dipshit had barely enjoyed what Annie had to offer,seemed he was more concerned about his dominant mommy, his cars,his rancid pets,so when Anne & I got together, I really opened her eyes sexually. We both couldn't keep our hands off each other, we wrote the book on PDA. Anywhere & everywhere. So she's moved back with her parents, extremely warm a nice old school farmer Italian family,, they had their hands full, their oldest daughter between marriages, 2nd oldest dumping a child on them who had more than a few learning disabilities. 3rd daughter,in a shit marriage,so you get the idea. So now I want to ,I need to find out why the most important person ever in my life would feel as if she needed to get married to a fuckup. She explained that as a late sophomore or early junior ,she gravitated to a fast crowd & fell in love with the big time senior star athlete. She lost her virginity to him like several did before her,she thought she could get him to love her if she had sex with him This let on for several weeks before he threw her away like last week's newspaper & she was devastated. The you girl was lost & figured a marriage to anything or anyone would put her in the right direction. As months pasted by she eventually got a quick divorce but all I kept thinking about was this first piece of shit that fucked my girl. I was miserable, uptight always angry. There was more than once than I stalked him & his family out & with a borrowed pistol, I was ready to settle some scores. I didn't go through with it but it continued to effect every aspect of our lives.We did get married ,in a civil ceremony, again I blamed her because we couldn't have a church wedding. Now before I even met Annie, I had moo than a few GFs, more sex partners but a couple GFs that I even stayed in touch with. Before them, I was heading for a life as a gay man. I couldn't wait until gym, football or baseball games or practices to see my fellow freshman students naked,in the big shower room, soaping & rinsing, checking out their tight bodies, seeing who had a bigger cock then others, seeing who had hair & who barely did. It's funny, maybe because of that,I like to have my men as hairless as I am & when it comes to women,I love a bush, especially a dark bush. About the same time I was stealing the family car & going to adult bookstores & theaters & watch porn but the porn that would get me going was bisexual & gay,I also would buy gay porn magizines. It was during an intense jerkoff session when I started to selfsuck, able to put the head of my penis in my mouth, before long I was fingering my asshole & having myself ejaculate in my mouth,mosty,some would hit my chin& chest,but I got the feeling of cock in my mouth & cum swallowing,which I still do to this day. The furthest I ever went with a guy was fondling each other through GHs, still wasn't ready for more but as a15 to 18 yearold , pretty good. At 18 as when all these young, native & easy young girls couldn't wait to test their pussies out on any dumbfuck who could say,\u201dHi'. ( A whole lot easier than for sure). So as my relationship with Annie progressed, I didn't feel it would be a good idea to bring up my desires after all, I wasn't going back to adult bookstores or theaters or even worse, I ,we were both sexually satisfied. Before long I was treating her like shit,both mentally & physically,then I was out with some of my old GFs & having sex with them. She started doing the same & she wound up the winner in this,we eventually broke up, I moved far enough away to find a job that kept me busy. In the area in which I was living there were plenty of \u201creasonable faximilies\" ,as well as me being able to travel for my job & let's not forget my one a week prostitute habit. During this time, I started hitting the adultbookstores , theaters & anything else regarding sexual activity. It was also when I because a nudists & exhibitionist,it was during being in the parking lot just off the nude beach where I encountered an older county worker who was just off the parking lot in a semisecluded area. He hand his work pants down to his knees, back semi turned, like ,\u201d,if you want it ,here it is\". & It was one of the biggest & nicest cocks I'd seen anywhere. I walked nearby, took of the little bit of clothes I had & kneeled before him,I looked up at his sunglassed covered eyes & engulfed his cock & sucked & licked it. After a few minutes of my first time sucking someone else's cock ,he unloaded his cum in my mouth & like a good little boy, I ate all up, it was everything & more that I dreamed of. My older friend , just grinned as he pulled up ,, zipped up,& drove away. I was hooked from then on. Fortunately I met my current wife a few years later, our sex life doesn't compare with sex with Annie of even anyone. She great, terrific woman,mother & more, but no she doesn't know about my bisexuality,she aware that I have a very kinky streek & she has basically said, I rather have you put your cock in someone else's mouth than mine anymore. It just don't do anything that would cause her embarrassment. As I've continued my sexual growth ,I've been involved in 3way,4somes, groups,orgies, when I have a FWB ,we'll get into swinging. I go to nude beaches & resorts every chance I can, I've even been with TGurls, more than once,in fact the 2nd gurl I was with took my anal virginity. I've even been in the middle of a 3Tgurl on one. All this for a very masculine middle aged husband & father, just your average guy next door. To wrap it up my Deepest Darkest Fantasy is to have that first guy who fucked Annie & made our lives so damn miserable for all that time & messing her up to this day because I messed her up ,lack of respect,self asstine,etc . Because very comfortable sexually, I really want the guy who fucked her first to use me ,let me suck your cock, eat you asshole, I want you to cum inside me, just like you came inside Annie all those years ago. I want him to fuck the shit out me ,film it,send it to her.
