No printer could ever print photos with so much information.\nWe use RAW to have more data for the post-processing, so that we can change exposure, colours, framing, etc. without losing \u201cdata\u201d when printing, but so we discard much data when preparing the raw photos. RAW gives you freedom in post processing, but please do not put too much data on output: it will make bad photos: a photo (nearly often) should convey some information, but not too much.

Forget that camera store what you see: our eyes are very different compared to camera sensors, so you need to optimize the parameters, there is not curve that fit all.\nBut you will see worst problem in photo lab. You can select the compression of JPEG, so removing most of artifacts, but most of photo labs will ignore your colour profile (forget AdobeRGB, they will develop with sRGB also if your photo contain a wide gamut profile). This is so frequent, but very few use your profile: you see with colour skin. For good photo: you need to print several time, and correct (because of printers).

If the exposure settings do change along with the dial, but the displayed value doesn\u2019t equal the selected value, there may be some sort of offset in the circuitry somewhere.\nIf the exposure setting circuitry isn\u2019t working correctly, any kind of repair probably requires opening up the camera.

So you have to decide whether you want to spend money to get someone to fix the camera (assuming you can find a suitable repair place - this camera is pretty old), or just use it as it is.

I switched back\u2014mostly. C1 does one thing profoundly better than LR, and that\u2019s in its name. I keep it around for tethered shooting. There\u2019s no better tethering solution out there. For food photography, it would be invaluable. I suggest you get the cheap Sony-only C1 for capture and the CC Photography plan for organization and editing. Here\u2019s why.\nC1 has many more features than LR, but the interface is unrefined, counterintuitive, and the whole app is buggy as hell. Some of its banner features, such as catalog-based image management and layered editing, aren\u2019t as useful as they should be.\nLayers can\u2019t be copied or grouped, renaming is difficult (because the arrow keys don\u2019t move one character left or right when you\u2019re typing a name; they select the next image), and you have a limit of 16 per image. Probably the biggest limitation is that you can only apply one instance of an effect per layer. Lightroom\u2019s layer system is far from perfect (a layers panel, with naming and grouping, would be a godsend), but at least you can use an unlimited number of them.\nC1\u2019s catalog management is awful. There\u2019s no 1:1 equivalent of LR\u2019s grid view (essentially a digital contract sheet), which makes culling much more difficult. Settings and filtering are hidden in panels you may never find. Export is confusing and overcomplicated. I don\u2019t think I ever managed to export something exactly as I intended to. Too many settings, and some of them seem contradictory.\nLightroom excels in almost all of these. Where it doesn\u2019t, it has tight integration with Photoshop. I wish Adobe would stop babying LR, and share a few more advanced abilities from Photoshop, like a layers panel with proper mask control, and real, capable content-aware healing brush, but those are minor gripes after using C1.\nGood luck and happy shooting!", "I use Lightroom as my photo workflow suite, I have used CaptureOne and didn\u2019t like it too much but that was purely because I was already very familiar with Lightroom and moving to a new interface was weird. I think that feature-wise there\u2019s little to choose between them both.\nHowever, the Adobe photography subscription comes with Photoshop as well as Lightroom, so you get a workflow app and an editing app. Lightroom can do editing but really it\u2019s a workflow solution - same as CaptureOne. If you went for CaptureOne, you\u2019d likely still need to find an editing suite on top of that - either Photoshop or one of the alternatives."], "topic_list": ["Food Photography", "Sony (company)", "DSLR Cameras", "Lighting", "Photographers", "Digital Cameras", "Digital Photography", "Cameras", "Photography"], "view_list": [189, 756], "create_time": "Apr 19, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Josh Diekman", "upvote_list": [1, 2], "question_title": "Light room vs capture on for food photography?

At that time and for many years to come, photographers had to fight to have their work recognized as serious art. Photography was looked down upon by many if not most traditional artists, art critics, historians, and collectors. Photographers didn\u2019t seem to call upon any of the physical and perceptual skills traditionally associated with fine arts such as the ability to draw or mix paints or understand perspective and proportion in order to make highly refined and expressive interpretations of the world. Photography was seen as a mere mechanical process that any amateur snap-shooter could do using his Kodak box camera, which George Easrman had marketed in the 1890s. So I think Steiglitz\u2019s biggest contribution to photography was insisting that people could use cameras and film to make profound aesthetic interpretations of life. In other words, to see it as an extension of art and therefore to see photographers as artists.\nI leave it to others to discuss the many technical innovations that Steiglitz brought to the process of making photographs.

Then again, enthusiasts spit on the livemode. They love the viewfinder instead which gives you upto 7 RAW per second. Which if clicked at the right time can get you an amazing motion shot.\n- Improved ISO to help with the narrow aperture when you are at the end of your zoom range\n- Auto Focus performance.

Photography is not about Camera Specifications as there is much more to the craft than discussing Camera or lens numbers. Having said that I will add that f-5.6 is a fairly crappy lens to expect miracles from when using a micro 4/3rds camera. Olympus like most other Camera\u2019s will perform so much better with a reasonably good lens and in my case the Olympus Camera that I bought did not have a Quality Lens supplied with it But then neither did my Canon 6-D Full Frame camera as it was \u201cBody Only\u201d. So the Purchaser can then source a good lens that will do the job which he or she has in mind.\nI would suggest that a lens with a aperture of around f 2.8 will work so much better on a micro 4/3rds system and I would not bother converting numbers around but simply start looking through the viewfinder and what you see is what you get. Yes there are those amongst us who want to go right down to f 1.?? but I mean \u201cReally\u201d is that necessary for what you do.", "There\u2019s no converting to full frame \u2014 that\u2019s really just a crutch for people who grew up only using 35mm cameras and refuse to learn anything else. This is mostly about depth of field.\nWhen I put this 25mm f/0.95 lens on my Pen-F, it\u2019ll have the same depth of field at the same aperture as any other 25mm lens on any other camera (mostly\u2026 I\u2019ll get to that). Not surprisingly, that\u2019s a function of the lens, not the sensor.\nNow, the full-frame thing is an adjustment for the relative image size. The 25mm on Pen-F is a normal lens, but a 25mm on a full-frame camera is a wide angle. To get the same image from the same distance, I\u2019d need a 50mm lens on a full frame. To get the same depth of field, I\u2019d need an f/1.9 lens. For this same shot on a 1\u2033 camera like the Sony RX100, I\u2019d need an 18mm lens at f/0.7. Probably not going to happen. To get this same image on a Fujifilm GFX-50R, I\u2019d need a 64mm at f/2.4. The standard GFX normal lens is 64mm at f/2.8, so not quite as shallow a DOF on the medium format camera.\nSo, there is a bit of a difference in depth-of-field based on the sensor, but this is often confusing people. You have to understand what, precisely, depth of field actually is to understand this. Let\u2019s point our virtual camera at a perfect point of light, and look at what we see on the camera\u2019s image sensor. That projected image will not also be a perfect point, but a circle or disc, called the circle of confusion. Aperture, lens design, and focus determine how small this circle can be. For any given lens and aperture, the minimal circle of confusion for this point of light is perfect focus.\nHowever, we don\u2019t care about perfect focus, and that\u2019s good, because of course, not everything in your image is at the same distance to the camera. So what do we care about? Basically, we\u2019d like the circle of confusion to be no larger than two pixels in size. The implication of this is that, for a smaller pixel size, you need a better lens design to get a sharp image, and you will have slightly less depth of field than you\u2019d see with that same lens on a lower-resolution camera. This also tells you that for ideal performance, your lens should be designed for the sensor size and range of pixel sizes in use. Think about this: the pixels in my old Canon EOS 6D full frame camera have 67x the area of the pixels in my smartphone\u2019s main camera. A lens that was just sharp enough to deliver a \u201cperfect\u201d 20 megapixel image on my Canon would have enough optical resolution to deliver a 720 kilopixel image on my phone\u2019s chip. Realistically, most Canon lenses were more than sharp enough for a 20 megapixel sensor, but many didn\u2019t hold up well when Canon delivered their 50 megapixel EOS 5DS.\nAs far as 35mm or full frame go, my point is that it\u2019s an arbitrary comparison, and \u201cconverting to full frame\u201d is only important if you, personally, have some need to view things from within that system or that mindset. My only full frame cameras today are rarely used 35mm film cameras, so I don\u2019t have this particular need outside of writing articles for regular people who sill might be enchanted with the 35mm film dominance that either ended in the 1990s or never actually existed outside of the professional world.", "No.\nApertures are described as relative to the focal length of the lens. So f/5.6 is f/5.6 regardless of the focal length (the f in f/5.6 refers to the focal length).\nWhen you mount a lens on a crop sensor body, the focal length does not change. The field of view changes, but your 50mm lens is still a 50mm lens no matter what you have mounted it to.\nSo, because the focal length does not change, and because the aperture is always expressed relative to the focal length, the aperture does not change either.", "Why are you converting to FF?

I say most, because not all are physically mountable, like the catadioptric series that may interfere with the grip.\nThere is no universal rule for interchangeability.\nLenses from film Nikons however, may not be automatic. Be prepared to operate them manually. Just set your exposure dial to \u2018Aperture Priority\u2019 and you\u2019ll find this works well.\nI have some great classic Nikon lenses that I use digitally. This includes the 50 mm f1.2, the Medical Nikkor, the 500 mm catadioptric and the shifting axis lens. Bear in mind that on the non-full frame digital Nikons, focal length effectively doubles, hence the 50mm f1.2 now becomes a 100 mm lens, so I plan accordingly. My 85/300 now becomes a 170/600. More length than I\u2019ll ever need for my applications. And operating them in the AP mode is a small sacrifice to make, so I can use lenses that I\u2019ve become comfortable with, over the years\nWith a suitable adapter, I also use them on my Olympus 4/3 bodies, again a successful marriage.\ngac", "There are 3 digital Nikon interchangeable lens systems, Nikon F (DSLRs), Nikon 1 (mirrorless), and Nikon Z (mirrorless).\nWhen you say old lenses, I'm guessing you mean F-mount lenses, but if you dig around on Ebay you might also come across Nikon S-mount which were their rangefinder camera lenses.\nOn mirrorless (both 1 and Z) it's easy, all you need is an adapter, assuming somebody is making it. For F-mount lenses you need a FTZ adapter to mount them on Nikon Z, and FT1 for Nikon 1. There aren't any official Nikon adapters to mount S-mount lenses on mirrorless but there might be third-party ones.\nThe easiest (or so it would seem) scenario is mounting F-mount lenses on F cameras (DSLRs). The mount has been pretty much the same for many decades. But it did undergo some small changes.\nYou can divide the old manual Nikon lenses into 2 groups - pre-AI and AI or AI-S. Pre-AI were produced in the years 1959 to 1973, and AI from 1973 onwards. Pre-AI lenses are marked with a letter representing the number of optical elements (U, B, T, Q, P, H, S, O, N, D representing the numbers 1-10). So if you find an old lens and it says for example Nikkor-H on it, it means it's a pre-AI lens that features a 6-element design. AI and AI-S lenses didn't have any additional letters added to Nikkor. An additional way of telling whether a lens is pre-AI or AI is the bunny ears visible on the image below (the metal element attached to the lens on the left). If they are solid, the lens is pre-AI. If each has a hole in it, the lens is AI or AI-S.\nPre-AI lenses can't be mounted on most Nikon DSLRs because they will cause mechanical damage to the aperture pusher on the camera body. Nikon DF has means of retracting that pusher in order to make it safe to use a pre-AI lens. I also read it's safe to use those lenses on Nikon D3x00 and D5x00 cameras, but I would investigate it a bit more before trying. Nikon DF is the only digital Nikon DSLR where the use of pre-AI lenses is officially endorsed. On all other Nikon DSLRs it will cause damage.\nIt was quite common to get pre-AI lenses converted to AI, Nikon was even selling kits that allowed to replace the entire aperture ring with a new updated one. DIY conversions were also being performed, which involved filing off a bit of the ring around the lens mount to accommodate the aperture pusher. This makes the lenses safe to mount on any DSLR, so if you see on Ebay or somewhere else that a lens has been AI-converted, that's what they mean. In the case of the DIY conversion it of course largely depends on the skill and attention to detail of the person performing the work.\nNikon AI Conversion\nThere is also a small sub-group of pre-AI lenses that can't be used on any DSLR. They are old fisheye lenses where the back element protrudes deep into the body and so it's not possible to use them without completely locking up the mirror, which isn't possible in a DSLR. They are easy to spot as the back element sticks out of the lens mount a lot more than your typical lens.\nAI and AI-S lenses can safely be mounted on any Nikon DSLR. Nikon D3x00 and D5x00 won't meter with it so you will only be able to work in M mode. Other DSLRs will offer metering as well as you will be able to add the parameters of your lens (focal length and maximum aperture) to your camera's memory and the camera will save this data to your EXIF (it will even know what is your currently selected aperture). This will allow you to work in aperture priority mode as well as manual with auto ISO for example. You won't be able to use shutter priority mode because the camera won't have any means of adjusting the aperture. Obviously there won't be autofocus because these are all manual lenses. I've used manual lenses extensively on Nikon DSLRs and they work great and made me abandon AF altogether. I've used lenses that Nikon either doesn't even have in their current line-up (50mm f/1.2, 8mm f/2.8) or lenses that would have been a lot more expensive (28mm f/3.5 PC shift lens that is a lot cheaper than any of the modern tilt-shift lenses).\nLastly, Nikon introduced AF in their lenses in 1987 so in my mind that's when the old lenses end and modern ones begin. However, this is 33 years ago so we can easily call them vintage. AF and AF-D lenses can be mounted on any DSLR, the aperture will be correctly controlled from the camera body, and there will be metering on all Nikon DSLRs. However, since these lenses rely on a focusing motor to be present in the body, the cameras that lack it (D3x00 and D5x00) won't autofocus. Also, I mentioned the aperture is controlled from the body. This is despite there being an aperture ring on the lens. You need to always stop it down all the way (a lot of these lenses will even have a lock that will prevent the aperture to be changed from that value), if you don't then an error will occur and you won't be able to take a photo. More information on this here: Agata Urbaniak's answer to What should I do? My Nikon D90 camera's aperture ring can only be kept at 22, except that error FEE occurs.", "Many DSLRs, both full frame as well as DX, can use older F lenses with limited abilities on metering and shooting modes, without AF support. Please refer to lens compatibility charts.\nEven without metering, you can go for shooting in RAW in manual mode with approximate settings that can be fine tuned by taking test shots. For portraits and landscapes the small trouble is worth taking as there may be considerable savings by using ultra wide and and super telephoto lenses with quality optics of the past.\nThis facility is not available to Canon users."], "topic_list": ["Nikon Lenses", "Nikon (company)", "Nikon Cameras", "Camera Lenses", "Cameras", "Photography"], "view_list": [45, 237, 17], "create_time": "Apr 17, 2020", "no_of_follower": 2, "question_author": "Sharad Gupta", "upvote_list": [2, 4, 1], "question_title": "Which Nikon camera can use old lenses?", "respond_collected": 3, "no_of_view": "735", "name_list": ["Gordon Clark", "Agata Urbaniak", "Yateendra Tyagi"], "date_list": ["Apr 18, 2020", "Apr 17, 2020", "Apr 17, 2020"]}, "641": {"ans_list": ["The Irish actress from New Ross, County Wexford graduated from the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts in 2003.

In the days of film, you were essentially stuck with whatever film speed you loaded into your camera, at least until you finished that particular roll. Digital cameras typically have ISO settings that range between 100 (low sensitivity) to 12,800 or greater (high sensitivity).

I hope you\u2019re doing well.\nThere a lot of ways you can compose an image when practicing landscape photography. They are majorly the basic rule of compositions we already know.

You dont always have to fill the frame.\nLook for patterns/shapes/geometry\nSometimes a subject can also be involved in a way that it gives a perspective of the while scene. Like a small hut in the midst of the mountains. Creates relatability.\nThere is also a golden spiral rule which is also somewhat like leading lines.\nYou could also look for frame in a frame.\nthese are just rules you can keep in mind to make your image look attractive and appealing to the eye. But it is also upon the whole scene, lighting, tones and colours. And also your creativity to break the rules to make something unique.\ni hope this helped.

Once the time has elapsed and the photos have been captured, in post processing, these photos are made into a video with a high playback speed.\nExample: 1 photo is being captured each second for 60 minutes. So, a total of 3600 photos have been captured. During playback, to match the human eye refresh rate, it is played at 30 fps, i.e 30 frames per second. So the resultant video is of 3600/30 = 120 seconds. Hence we have 1 hour worth of time compressed into 2 minutes. This is timelapse.\nSome cameras have the feature inbuilt, others, may have to make the video in post processing.\nI hope it is clear that the video speed has no bearing on a timelapse.\nFeel free to reach out in case you have more doubts.

The pinhole has a certain diameter, so lets call that diameter 1 unit. Let\u2019s take this as a baseline for evaluating sharpness. Various effects will become apparent with different objects and images and distances from the pinhole itself, but they will all be relative to the diameter of the pinhole. If you began evaluating the images at 10 pinhole diameter units distance from the pinhole, it would be a rather small image to evaluate. If the criteria for sharpness is how much detail can be observed within an image area, this image will not be sharp, only showing things in broad outline. But the pinhole can work quite well at a short image distance to differentiate items of sizes that fit well with the optical geometry of a pinhole set up. So now increase the distance for the images to 100 pinhole diameter units from the pinhole. In a comparison with a 10 pinhole diameter units image, the 100 pinhole diameter units image is 10 times bigger linearly, and so 100 times the area, but dimmer at 1% of the surface illumination of a 10 pinhole diameter units image. But instead of items being shown only in very broad outline, there will be some finer sense of form emerging. So now let us increase our image distance to 1000 pinhole diameter units. This step is to another 10x linear, 100x the area, and just 1% illumination of the 100 pinhole diameter units image. At this point the potential for finer image detail has been countered by the effects of diffraction. If you already know about diffraction, enough said, if not, look it up! So the long answer is, If you already have a good pinhole, it will have a range of best usage related to it\u2019s diameter. I would posit that at working distances above 100 pinhole diameters but short of 1000 pinhole diameters, you can find a good sweet spot, where relative to the exposed surface area, the inherent deficiences of the pinhole images are at their minimum, and with available sensitive materials, useful images can be achieved within workable exposure times. The working distance measured in pinhole diameter units works just like the f number with exposure estimation, because that\u2019s what it is.

You can see its reflection in the right side of the camera\u2019s lens.\nTo camera right is a 2X concave makeup mirror angled to throw a faux spot inside the lens hood. I wanted maximum detail of the iris diaphragm.\nWhat looks like a lot of lights is really one dominant light, bounced. Everything else is redirected with reflectors. I was taught the KISS rule: Never use three lights when one will do.\nSlightly overexposing for the black camera results in a stark white seamless background.\nThe light falling on my set is measured at 2700K so that\u2019s where I set my white balance, but I shoot raw so I can adjust it so that background is rendered as white with no color cast.\nThis idea can be scaled up for portraits, groups, whatever, but then you need a larger roll of white seamless paper and more powerful lights, preferably studio strobes. If you haven't got a white ceiling to bounce from you\u2019ll need to either repaint it or use some white paper coved overhead to bounce into. So long as the lighting is uniform and you expose for the subjects the background should go very bright without wrapping around the subjects.", "Photographically speaking, if the background material is already a white/light material, then the background light value should be 1.5\u20132 stops brighter than the light on your subject. For example, if the correct exposure for the subject is f/5.6, the light values on the background should read between f/9.0 and f/11.\nThis formula assumes that the subject is standing at 8\u201310 feet in front of the white material/background.\nIf the background material is black, then add 2\u20133 stops to the above equation. If the light on your subject is f/5.6 then the light falling onto the black background/material should read between f/18 and f/25.\nA value can be made lighter or darker depending on the lighting ratios employed.", "This would depend on what You are trying to photograph and how much of this sort of thing that you will be doing as well as what you are planning to do with the finished photographs. So if it is small items like jewellery for example then you could get a piece of white cardboard and place the item on the cardboard and then you would want to think about some sort of lighting and this could get to be a bit of a challenge as lighting can create colour casts and unwanted highlights and shadows and so there is that.\nIf you are planning of photographing a larger object or many a person then a bed-sheet might do as a one off sort of backdrop or if you have a few shots in mind then maybe paint the wall white as like how important is it and how many shots are you doing and how big are the subjects. I am thinking that if you are doing shote of a whole lot of people like for a School Magazine and want the whole class of 2020 individually photographed or are you wanting to photograph a Black Cat with a white background or are you thinking of like a Red Car with a white background.

The light on the background should be soft and spread out evenly, to eliminate any shadows.\nFinally, you\u2019ll need some way of figuring out the exposure.

Three thousand lives had been lost that day, I the chaos and the ruins, three firemen raised an American flag as a symbol of defiance against those that would attack us, and as a sign of hope that America was united and would get through this tragedy too. Unaware that their actions would be caught on film, these dusty first responders hoisted a \u201cborrowed\u201d flag atop a pole at Ground Zero. Just who were these three men?\nThey were three firefighters all Brooklyn-based, two from Ladder 157, George Johnson and Dan McWilliams, and Billy Eisengrein from Rescue 2.\nMcWilliams had used a K12 Saw to cut off the yardarm of the yacht Star of America, which was flying an American flag on the day of 9 /11 after the collapse of the Twin Tower. Together the three mounted the 3 by 5 foot flag onto a pole at ground zero, which became an iconic photo taken by photographer Thomas E Franklin about 5 PM.\nThe raised flag at Ground Zero disappeared probably that night, Bew York City thought they were in possession of the photographed flag, with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and even Governor George Pataki signing it. This flag then flew at, New York City Hall, Yankee Stadium and even on the USS Theodore Roosevelt when it was deployed to the Middle East.\nIt was only when owner of the Star of America prepared to formally donate the American flag that a problem arose. The Star of America\u2019s flag had small dimensions than the 5 by 8 foot flag being promoted as the iconic 9/11 flag.\nThe History Channel aired an episode on the missing Ground Zero flag, and a few days later, clear across the country in Everett, Washington, a man who only identified himself as Brian, dropped off the flag in a plastic bag, saying he believed this was the original 9/11 flag at Ground Zero.\nBrian told a story that he was a Marine who had been deployed to the Middle East, and had been given the flag by an employee at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who in turn had been given the flag by a widow of a 9/11 victim. According to the New York Times article the owner of the Star of America, Shirley Dreifus, the yacht\u2019s flag flying on 9/11 was 3 by 5 feet, as opposed to the much larger one sign by Giuliani.\nExperts in forensic were called in to compare dust samples, and the same \u201cfingerprint\u201d of concrete, glass fibers, plastic, molten steel and asbestos matched.\nThis flag now is on display at the 9/11 Museum along side the iconic photo of the three New York firemen raising it."], "topic_list": ["American Flag", "Flags", "9/11 Conspiracy Theories", "Iconic Images", "9/11 Attacks", "National Flags", "Terrorism", "History of the United States of America", "Photographs", "Photography", "The United States of America"], "view_list": [52], "create_time": "Apr 17, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "James Morrison", "upvote_list": [1], "question_title": "What happened to the flag in the iconic 9/11 photo?

You can always get a smaller file out of the large one, but you can never get that original file back.\nMy Plustek 120 goes up to 10600 DPI. The thing with scanners is they often don't really produce a higher quality / more detailed file at their highest resolution. So I decided 5300 DPI would be sufficient for me when scanning 35mm, especially since I don't print. There are more important parameters of the scan for me, such as scanning to a raw file and using a high bit depth which allows me to further treat the images. The scanner I use is also terribly slow and even at 5300 DPI scanning a roll of 35mm film will take up my entire evening. The files come out at about 250MB which is pretty insane considering my digital 24 megapixel DNG files uncompressed weigh 32MB each. My 8 year old computer running Lightroom would not be happy at all if the files were even heavier.\nIf I were to scan 120 film at 5300 DPI, the files would end up being over 700MB. I still remember it being a standard file size for an entire movie in order to fit on a CD. So to me this is extreme and so I scan 120 at 2650 DPI instead. If I ever need a massive print, I can always go back and rescan a single frame because what I will never ger rid of is the negatives/slides.\nIt took me quite a long time to devise a workflow that allowed me to get the most out of the scanner. I was getting terrible results in terms of colour out of my scanning software Vuescan. I am no Lightroom expert but I have used it for a number of years and a lot of those files were unfixable for me no matter the Vuescan settings. In the end I settled on scanning to raw DNG for black and white and slides and treat them entirely in Lightroom, and raw TIF which I invert using ColorPerfect, a plugin for Photoshop, and then add finishing touches in Lightroom.

This company has done well in adapting their artistic tools to smartphones for even the most amateur photographer. It\u2019s easy to understand, use, and navigate. Because this app specializes in the zoom, color edits like Pop Color, and blemish removal, we especially like this app for white background photos.\nA huge plus is its exporting capabilities. With one touch, you can export your photos to your store\u2019s social media account. The JPEG Quality output also allows you to customize the quality and size of your final images to best fit your website or mobile app\n2) PicsArt Photo Editor + Collage\nIf you want to get creative with stickers, text, and brushes, this app will blow your mind. This app would be wasted on white-background photos. Instead, create unique lifestyle product photos.\nTake a picture of a model frolicking through the park in your company\u2019s apparel and bring it to life with stickers of daffodils and starbursts. Animate photoshoots of your furniture and home goods store with special effects. Not only can you create these product photos, but you can quickly create unique images for your new website or the next social media campaign.\n3) VSCO\nVSCO gets major points for UX/UI design for mobile editing. Ideal for those with little editing experience, this app can be used for white background photos and aesthetically pleasing lifestyle photos. The app also comes with tips and techniques for taking different kinds of photos.\n4) Adobe Lightroom CC\nThis app gives you access to a \u201cprofessional camera mode\u201d on top of several advanced adjustments. Though this app gives you the ability to edit on a professional level with just your cellphone, it\u2019s pretty high-tech for beginners. With premium features, you can delete any stray objects from your lifestyle images or adjust the perspectives on your white background photos.\nThis ap can also come in the Adobe Social Photo and Video Editors Bundle with three other graphic design and video editing apps.\n5) Facetune 2 \u2013 Fun Selfie Editor\nBest for lifestyle portrait photos for make-up, clothing, and accessories. Edit your product\u2019s lighting, model\u2019s faces, and background for the most visually appealing product photos. Additional tools include filters and studio lighting. True to its name, the \u201cselfie\u201d sized images are already the perfect size for your organization\u2019s Instagram.", "I believe we would be able to give a more precise answer if you could provide more information - for example, what are the products you going to sell, where are you going to sell, etc.\nBut I will try my best to answer you question.\nI will strongly recommend these 2 applications - Adobe Lightroom CC and Snapseed.\nLightroom CC is created by Adobe. It is basically the mobile version of the famous software Lightroom, which is used by many professional photographers. Most importantly, it is free. Of course, like many other freeware, you have to pay for extra features. But for normal usages it should suffice.\nOne key feature of Lightroom CC is the abundance of \u201cPresets\u201d. Presets are basically predefined filters that help create a special feel or edit your photos. Think of it as a one-click solution, a panacea to your photo. There are many free presets that you can find online.\nInstalling presets into Lightroom CC was a bit tricky, but no undoable. I have recently written a blog post about Lightroom CC Presets. If you ended up deciding to use Lightroom CC, feel free to have a read.\nThe Complete Guide to Adobe Lightroom CC (Mobile) Presets - TraPhoner\nSnapseed is another free application made by Google. It has provided more features than basically required. If you are into creative photography, Snapseed is great, because it has got things like film filters, vintage filters, and double exposure. Although these might be beyond the scope of product photography which you need at present. But you can be assured that most basic features, including tones and exposures, colours, sharpening and de-noising, are all available in Snapseed."], "topic_list": ["Photo Editing Apps", "Online Selling", "Photo Editing", "Digital Photography", "Android Applications", "Photography", "E-Commerce", "Software and Applications", "Mobile Applications"], "view_list": [400, 444], "create_time": "Apr 19, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Roma Singh", "upvote_list": [0, 1], "question_title": "Which mobile app will be good for online selling photo editing?", "respond_collected": 2, "no_of_view": "1,061", "name_list": ["Farhan Tanvir", "John Traphoner"], "date_list": ["Apr 20, 2020", "Apr 19, 2020"]}, "1067": {"ans_list": ["I would have gone with a 16\u201335mm lens instead.

Not unless we discover a method of travelling significantly faster than the speed of light. According to relativity, however, that\u2019s not possible. Though, there are some interesting ideas being tossed around that might change things\u2026 but we aren\u2019t likely to see anything along those lines for quite some time\u2026 probably hundreds of years.\nIn the meantime, the problem with telescopes is angular resolution.\nDue to the effects of diffraction, telescopes can only resolve so much detail. We measure this in angular resolution: how small of an angle are the finest details we can resolve.\nLet me give you an example: hold out your hand at arm\u2019s length and try to see your fingerprints. If you\u2019ve got really good eyes, you might be able to see some of the ridges and whorls, but just barely. Now bring your hand closer, really close, until you can see them clearly. The ridges are about 1/10th of a millimeter or so across, give or take depending on the person.\nIf I\u2019m holding my hand about 500 mm from my eye and can see a detail about .1 mm in size, that detail has an angular size of about 0.01 degrees, or aout 41 arcseconds (there are 60 arcminutes in a degree, and 60 arcseconds in an arcminute). If I move my hand out to about 1 meter, that would change the size of that detail to about 21 arcseconds. At that distance, I can barely, if at all, make out that size of detail.\nNow, with a telescope, I can magnify things\u2026 but I can only get so much detail out of them. If you\u2019ve ever used a telescope and kept trying higher and higher magnifications, you\u2019ll notice that the image gets blurrier and blurrier as you go. And this is the effect of diffraction. It\u2019s not a matter of focus, it\u2019s a matter of limited detail resolution.\nThe physics behind diffraction get pretty tricky. But to put it simply, when light waves pass through an opening - an aperture, such as that in a telescope - they begin to break down. This causes them to create interference patterns, which results in the image blurring. The size of details that can be seen depends on the wavelength (color) of light and the size of the aperture. Shorter wavelengths (bluer light) provides more detail than longer wavelengths (redder light). But we can use a more simple technique to estimate.\nIn the middle of the 19th century, an astronomer named W. R. Dawes conducted experiments. He had different people look through different sized telescopes. They were looking at two point-sources of lights (e.g. stars). He was trying to determine how far apart the two points had to be before a person can tell that there are two points and not just one. Through his experiments, he developed a formula for calculating how far apart in angular measure two stars must be before an observer can tell them apart for any given telescope aperture. This is known as the telescope\u2019s Dawes\u2019 Limit. The formula is R = 116/D where D is the aperture of the telescope in millimeters and R is the angle of resolution in arcseconds.\nI have several telescopes. My main telescope is an 8 inch, or 203 mm, Newtonian. It has a Dawes\u2019 Limit of about 0.57 arcseconds. My 80 mm refractor has a limit of about 1.45 arcseconds. My largest aperture is 10 inches, or 254 mm, which gives me a limit of about 0.46 arcseconds.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope\u2019s aperture is 2.7 meters, or 2700 mm. This gives it a resolution of about 0.043 arcseconds. The largest telescope currently in existence is the 10.4 meter Gran Telescopio Canarias in the Canary Islands. It has a Dawes\u2019 Limit of about 0.011 arcseconds.\nNow, the Dawes\u2019 Limit is not actually a description of detail resolution. But it\u2019s a relatively good estimate. As I mentioned before, diffraction is also controlled by the color of light. As it turns out, the Dawes\u2019 Limit is close to the diffraction limit for the wavelengths of light the human eye is most sensitive to (which makes sense, when you think about it).\nOk, so applying this to the problem at hand: seeing the surface of an exoplanet. The closest known exoplanets orbit Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our own. It appears to have at least one, possibly more, planets orbiting it. The best estimate that astronomers have for its size is about 1.6 or so times the mass of the Earth, with a radius of about 1.07 to 1.3 times that of the Earth. Let\u2019s use the upper limit, about 1.3 Earth radii. This would give it a diameter of roughly 16,564.6 kilometers.\nProxima Centauri is about 4.24 light years away. One light year is roughly 9,461,000,000,000 kilometers, or 9.461 trillion km. So Proxima Centauri b is roughly 40 trillion kilometers away.\nSo, doing the math on that, Proxima Centauri b has an angular size of roughly 0.000085 arcseconds, or 85 microarcseconds. Just to see the planet as more than a dot (a point-source of light), would require a telescope with an aperture of around 1.4 kilometers. To see something the size of, say, North America would require a telescope about 5.6 kilometers across. And this is just for the absolute nearest exoplanet under ideal conditions and using the most advantageous estimates.\nSimply put, this isn\u2019t going to happen, not any time soon.", "We already have.

This includes culprits like a subject that's moving, camera shake, noise due to a high ISO, and plain old bad focusing.\nSome of these errors are self-explanatory - if your subject is moving and they appear blurry in your photo, it could be because your shutter speed is too slow\n. If there's a lot of digital noise in your images, it's because the ISO is too high\n.\nOn the other hand, some of these problems can be harder to figure out. Camera shake, for example, could be the result of a number of factors - a slow shutter speed, not using a tripod, windy conditions (even when using a tripod), or simply having hands that are a little on the shaky side.\nThe same goes for bad focusing. There are a variety of issues that could cause poor focus, including being too close to the subject, having your focus point in the wrong area of the image, being too quick on the trigger and taking a photo before the lens focuses, or having a depth of field\nthat's too shallow for the subject to be nice and sharp.\nBut the great thing about sharpness is that there are a lot of ways to combat these problems so that you can create an image that is tack-sharp.\nLet's have a look at a few of the best solutions to the problems outlined above. And don't worry - they are all solutions that beginners can handle!\nGet a Tripod and Use it\nI'll be the first to say that I don't always enjoy carrying a tripod around...\nBut using a tripod is far and away one of the best ways to reduce blurriness in your images.\nBy giving your camera a stable base, you increase the likelihood that you'll get a sharp image.\nThat's because instead of depending on your hands, arms, and body for support - all of which move no matter how hard you try - you can put your camera on a tripod that isn't moving around.\nBetter still, you can enhance a tripod's ability to get a sharp image by improving its stability:\nIf the tripod has metal spikes on its feet, use them to give it more stable footing.\nIf the tripod has a center column hook, hang your camera bag, your backpack, or even a sack of dirt or rocks from it to anchor the tripod.\nRemove your camera strap so it doesn't flap in the wind.\nUse a camera remote so you don't have to physically touch the camera to fire the shutter.\nSure, using a tripod can be less convenient, but if your images gain sharpness, that inconvenience is worth it, is it not?\nGet the scoop on other benefits of shooting with a tripod in the video above from Adorama TV and Mark Wallace.\nGet a Grip on Your Camera\nIf you find that you're in a situation in which you can't use a tripod, your best bet is to learn how to hold your camera in such a way that you maximize its stability and therefore maximize your ability to get the sharpest photos.\nThat means you need to use both of your hands to support your camera - one firmly grasping the camera grip and the other underneath the camera and lens to lend it additional support.\nWhat's more, if you bring your elbows into your chest, you can form a sort of a tripod with your hands, arms, elbows, and your chest working together to keep your camera still, just as you can see above.\nThere are plenty of other ways to keep your camera still. Check them out in this comprehensive tutorial\n.\nUse Image Stabilization\nA lot of cameras and lenses today come with an image stabilization feature that won't eliminate blurry images, but it can certainly help.\nThis is especially true when you have to hold your camera because image stabilization can get you an additional two or three stops of working room.\nThat means that you can use a shutter speed that's two or three stops slower than you could normally use, and do so without worry of added blurriness due to camera shake.\nWhen used in combination with a solid grip on your camera, image stabilization can make a great deal of difference in the level of sharpness of your photos.\nCheck Your Exposure Settings\nAs I noted in the introduction, a lack of sharpness can be due to the aperture, shutter speed, or ISO settings.\nIn the case of aperture, if your depth of field (the area of the image that's in sharp focus) is too shallow, you might find that your subject isn't sharp, as seen in the image above.\nTo rectify matters, use a smaller aperture.\nFor example, if at f/2.8 your subject is blurry, change the aperture to f/5.6.\nThe problem with using a smaller aperture is that it restricts the amount of light entering your lens, which requires a slower shutter speed or a higher ISO.\nBut when you slow the shutter speed, you run the risk of getting images that are blurry because of the movement of the subject", "The most likely cause is camera shake. If you are using a small aperture. say f16, to get a good depth of field then you will need to use a relatively slow shutter speed in order to get the exposure right. Using a tripod would solve the problem but I find a monopod is a convenient solution. Using a higher film speed setting could also help.\nInaccurate focusing could result in either the foreground or the background being less than sharp. By using the hyperfocal distance setting you will get the greatest depth of field for any given aperture. In landscape photography, this setting will be a little short of the infinity mark but look it up for a more detailed explanation."], "topic_list": ["Landscape Photography", "Landscape", "Digital Photography", "Photographs", "Photography"], "view_list": [91, 79], "create_time": "Apr 15, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Bhavin Patel", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "question_title": "Why are my landscape photos not sharp?", "respond_collected": 2, "no_of_view": "925", "name_list": ["Larry Beagle", "Keith Crowther"], "date_list": ["Apr 17, 2020", "Apr 15, 2020"]}, "1183": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Visiting and Travel in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India", "Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India", "Iconic Images", "Photographs", "Photography", "Tourism"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 18, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Channamuthu Chethan", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "What are the beautiful pictures captured during lockdown days in Agra?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "10", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "636": {"ans_list": ["if it has a mechanical shutter, then you cannot turn its sound off!\nif it also does have a fully electronic shutter mode (some cameras do) then it could be possible to turn its sound off totally and make it a really silent shutter like that of the iPhone for example \u2026\nhowever, apparently Nikon D3300 doesn\u2019t offer that option \u2026 (fully electronic shutter is usually found in smartphones and sometimes in Bridge type of cameras and rarely in some DSLR cameras too \u2026 one of its best uses is for time-lapse photography when taking MANY ((many as in hundreds and thousands)) shots consecutively \u2026)\nit does (alongside some other Nikon DSLR models) have a Quiet shutter mode \u2026\ncheck this out for more info please:\nQuiet Shutter Release - Nikon D3300 Reference Manual", "You can\u2019t.

With that definition, we find the requested information by tracing any two of three rays.\nThis diagram makes the approximation that the front and back principal planes coincide with the plane of symmetry of the lens.\nSince this distance of 45 centimetres is greater than the focal length of 25 centimetres, a ray from the a point on the tree, passing through the front focal point, will hit the front principal plane, and pass through the lens (if it is not too far off the optical axis, in which case it does not contribute to the image). Since that ray passes through the lens, that tells us that the image is on the opposite side of the lens, and is real.\n\nThat ray hits the front principal plane on the opposite side of the optical axis from where it started. Such a ray will emerge from the back principal plane parallel to the optical axis, and where it entered the front principal plane, i.e. still on the far side of the optical axis. That tells us that the image is inverted.\nAnother ray we can usefully trace is one that passes from the above-selected point on the tree through the front principal point, i.e. where the optical axis passes through the front principal plane. That ray passes out through the back principal plane through the back principal point, i.e. still on the optical axis, in the same direction.\n\nThis ray intersects ray 1 on the tree, of course, and also at the image. The latter intersection tells us where the image is formed. Since this ray leaves the back principal point in the same direction as it enters the front principle point, it tells us that the ratio of distances from the respective principal planes is the ratio of sizes of object and image. It also tells us that the image is inverted.\nRay 3 is much like ray 1, except that it is parallel to the optical axis on the object side and passes through a focal point on the image side, rather than the other way around.\nWe find the distance of the image from the back principal plane by the above ray-tracing, which yields the equation\n[math]\\dfrac 1 s + \\dfrac 1 {s^\\prime} = \\dfrac 1 f ,[/math]\nin which\n[math]s[/math] is the distance of the object from the front principal plane.\n[math]s^\\prime[/math] is the distance of the image from the back principal plane.\n[math]f[/math] is the focal length.\nWe solve for [math]s^\\prime:[/math]\n[math]s^\\prime = \\dfrac 1 {\\dfrac 1 f - \\dfrac 1 s } = \\dfrac 1 {\\dfrac 1 {25} - \\dfrac 1 {45} } = 56.25.[/math]\nThis is the location of the image plane (assuming the object is a plane, which it isn\u2019t, even if the tree is a plane tree).\nThe magnification, as is apparent from the diagram, is\n[math]\\dfrac {s^\\prime} s = \\dfrac {56.25} {45} = 1.25.[/math]\nAFAIK this is all the information about the image that we can derive with the given information."], "topic_list": ["Convex Lens", "Lenses", "Focal Length", "Camera Lenses", "Optics", "Photography", "Mathematics"], "view_list": [231], "create_time": "Apr 18, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "R.H Music", "upvote_list": [3], "question_title": "A converging lens has a focal length of 25 cm.

If I understand the question, my answer is burst.\nMy cameras\u2019 default frame setting is slow burst, 3 frames per second (FPS). They can go up to 8 or even 8+, 11 FPS, but it\u2019s vanishingly rare for me to even drive them on medium, 6 FPS. In slow burst I can still squeeze off one frame if I choose; the other settings are too fast on the trigger, and anyway I don\u2019t need that many frames that fast. 2 or 3 should suffice.\nI trained and worked entirely in analog, manual, film, and even if my 35mm cameras had what were then \u201cmotor drives\u201d I hardly ever used them. I loaded 36-exposure rolls and were I to fire at a moderate 6 FPS the entire roll would be exhausted in 6 seconds. Then it had to be processed and proofed. The roll cost money. The processing and proofing cost money. There was a high probability the real best frame was the one you missed while you were reloading. For the great majority of us, developing the skill to anticipate the moment and shoot a single frame was the way to go. We were justifiably proud of that ability, but there were the inevitable misses. You showed the picture anyway because it was an important shot, but you cringed when they said, Oh but she blinked; that\u2019s too bad.\nWhen I started shooting digital I did try to maintain that discipline for a time. I maybe could still do it, but I confess: I have become a burst addict.\nOnce I was disciplined to take a single frame, win, lose, or draw. But the losers were so frustrating. It made sense at the time; now I think the short burst makes more sense. There is no longer any reason not to take another. We are not limited, not if we have a high capacity card, not if we always have a spare battery in the pocket. There is no cost to take another, or 6. The cull takes longer, but there should be no fear of being forced to show clinkers; no one need ever know you got any clinkers.\nI habitually shoot 3 or 4 frames of many things, especially people. I am a skilled candidman. I love to shoot people candidly, but those darn people\u2014they blink! They make bizarre faces! They do random stuff that the one-shot photographer may capture, and if it\u2019s the only shot you got well, that\u2019s the only shot.\nAs a perfectionist I revel\u2014REVEL in being able to take 3 or 4 frames and choose the very best. The bad stuff (we all get \u2018em) goes in the trash and no one is the wiser. I can show only the standouts and everyone crows Oh what amazing timing he has! \u2026and I snicker quietly and slink away, feeling maaaaybe a little twinge of guilt, especially for my now lost skill and timing, but I got the pitcher!

And that\u2019s true regardless of whether you are using film, digital, or some other type of photographic medium.\nWhat your camera does to make a photograph depends on the engineering design and medium. Digital cameras may use analog amplifiers, some use different digital processing. With film you can change the film processing or the printing. Whatever. You\u2019re the photographer, you get to choose how translate light into tones in the final image.", "Funny, I\u2019ve been thinking about this lately and how ISO is really a bad system for digital photography, it\u2019s left over from film and described film speed. In digital it doesn\u2019t really tell you much. I noticed this when I applied the sunny 16 rule and saw that digital really didn\u2019t work for that rule.\nI would like to see it more descriptive of what happens to a digital capture like a +1 noise and a-1 for contrast. The newest sensors are so much better than film ever was at ISO 6400 or even higher, but the difference between 3200 and 6400 is 1 f/stop and that doesn\u2019t tell me much if there is no real difference in the output.", "Essentially the answer is yes. However there are ramifications of doing this. Once you reach a certain level of increase gain you begin to drive more noise into the visible range thereby reducing the dynamic range and increasing the interference with the actual image quality. Often a noisy image, just like in past a grainy image, is better than noImage at all. So for most folks this isn\u2019t any kind of a serious problem. I recommend that generally the top ISO worth using is 25% of the maximum stated by the manufacture . In other words, if the camera would go to 100,000 ISO, I would stop at 25,000.", "Yes, you are electronically increasing the sensitivity of the photo sensor subsystem by increasing the gain of the pixel sensors. before being digitized.", "Watch this video to Understand the ISO sensitivity in detail.. You will get all your answer here\u2026\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb", "The way I understand gain, when you crank it up, at some point you start getting distortion that gets progressively worse.\nWhen you crank up ISO the practical effect is the same \u2014 at some you start getting distortions of a different kind. As an old film photog, I prefer shooting at ISO 100; but then I\u2019m not taking photographs where I might miss the shot; in fact quite often on a tripod.\nBut the ISO is not alone. If I\u2019m not mistaken, there are other factors besides gain in the audio world, such as bass and treble and so forth. In photography, ISO 100 in a certain lighting situation might call for F2.8 at 1/60th of a second. But if you needed to shoot at f11 to get the depth of field, you\u2019d have to adjust either the shutter speed or the ISO. Cranking up the ISO has less effect on the quality of the final image than slowing down the shutter speed \u2014 unless you have a tripod. Lots of factors, but most of the time a bit more ISO is the easiest solution.\nTo me, the noise introduced by higher ISO can only be covered up or blurred over in post, not really cured. When the event being photographed is more important than the quality of the image, then certainly crank up the ISO as high as you can and still get what you consider a reasonable image. I have a shot of the Rolling Stones on stage back in 1977 in Europe. I know what\u2019s in the image, but it\u2019s actually just a blur, but I made a print anyway.", "Yes. But contrary to Anthony de Vries answer, it\u2019s not always the same as underexposing and pulling up in post. It mostly depends on whether your camera sensor is ISO invariant or not.\nIf your camera is ISO invariant, there is no difference between shooting at a high ISO or shooting at a low ISO and then boosting exposure in post. In both of these cases, the noise produced will be the same because there\u2019s little or no noise applied from the downstream processing in the camera. The sensor and the physics of light generate a bit of noise, which boosting ISO will amplify, but this also gets amplified if you haul the exposure slider over to the right in post. The net result is that the amount of noise is the same - as long as yoru camera is ISO invariant.\nIf your sensor is not ISO invariant however (and many modern sensors aren\u2019t, while many sensors that are ISO invariant are only invariant for parts of the ISO range), then it\u2019s not the same at all. Yes, boosting ISO increases the gain at the sensor. However there\u2019s a non-trivial amount of noise applied from the downstream processing, and this doesn\u2019t get amplified by boosting ISO, but it does get boosted from pushing exposure in post.\nNoise in photos comes from three sources, listed here in the order in which the camera encounters them.\nPhoton noise. This is always present, it\u2019s from the inherent randomness of photon movement. There\u2019s no way to reduce this and it would affect even a theoretically perfect sensor.\nUpstream noise (analogue read noise). This is what gets boosted by increasing the ISO. This comes from a variety of sources that are mostly to do with the sensor itself, heat issues at the sensor and a few other things. The signal from the sensor is analogue and this is what gets boosted when you increase the ISO - signal and noise equally. Increasing the ISO is analogue amplification.\nDownstream noise (digital read noise). This is from other sources in the camera including the analogue to digital conversion. This is not amplified by boosting ISO because the ISO boost happens during the upstream part of the signal, before it is converted to a digital signal.\nThe camera adds an additional gain boost after the digital processing step. This will increase both upstream and downstream read noise. If your camera doesn\u2019t produce any downstream noise however then it\u2019s ISO invariant because boosting in post has precisely the same effect as boosting the ISO - the only noise is from the photon noise and the upstream noise and these will be equally affected by brightening in post or by cranking up the ISO.\nIf the camera is not ISO invariant however, then you will get worse results by increasing brightness in post, becasue you will be amplifying downstream noise as well as photon and upstream noise.", "Making ISO adjustments allows you to photograph under low light conditions. It\u2019s a tool just like shutter speed and f/stop adjustments. Does this flexibility come with a trade-off? Yes, the noise in the darker tones can increase. The way around this is to reduce the noise in post.\nDo not be afraid to increase the ISO. When I shot sports at night outdoors, I regularly had and ISO range from 5,000\u201310,000. Get the shot, always. ISO induced noise will be the least of your problems if you miss the shot.\nHere\u2019s an example of a 10000 ISO image. Far left is right out of camera. Middle noise reduced using a value of 40. Far right, same noise reduction plus overall sharpening. You\u2019ll want to sharpen after noise reduction because noise reduction softens details.", "Yes, you are.\nActually, in many cases it is even simpler\u2026 with many modern sensors, there is nothing to change at the sensor, and you are simply multiplying the numbers coming from the sensor.\nI.e. it is purely post-processing, completely the same as underexposing and pulling up."], "topic_list": ["Digital Cameras", "Digital Photography", "Cameras", "Photography"], "view_list": [404, 384, 539, 124, 35, 539, 374, 0, 323], "create_time": "Apr 17, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Robin Coile", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], "question_title": "When you increase the ISO in your digital camera you are simply increasing the gain?", "respond_collected": 9, "no_of_view": "4,365", "name_list": ["Jeffrey Kantor", "Bill Koplitz", "John Van Steenberg", "Loring Chien", "Arup Dutta", "Brandon Smith", "Iain Compton", "Michael Stern", "Anthony de Vries"], "date_list": ["Apr 23, 2020", "Apr 22, 2020", "Apr 20, 2020", "Apr 19, 2020", "Apr 19, 2020", "Apr 18, 2020", "Apr 18, 2020", "Apr 18, 2020", "Apr 18, 2020"]}, "803": {"ans_list": ["Enjoy them !

However, my problem with it is that it\u2019s too complicated for a beginner (and too expensive), but close enough in price to a full frame (especially used) that a seasoned photographer should probably pony up the extra money for a full frame. I used an inexpensive Nikon D5000 for 10+ years and got stunning shots with it, but I outgrew the features and technology. Image quality, although \u201conly\u201d 12MP was absolutely perfect, don\u2019t let anyone tell you you need a certain amount of megapixels unless you\u2019re doing HEAVY cropping and very huge prints (I have a 20x30 landscape print from that camera that looks flawless). I thought that because the image quality was fine from the D5000, it would only be better from the D7500, with the added benefit of the extra features and technology. I was right - but the image quality is only slightly better, and as such I wish I had gotten a full frame.

Perhaps I could take this opportunity to supplement a bit if you do not mind.\nPersonally after some years of photography both leisurely and professionally, I switched from DSLR photography to mobile phone photography a few years ago. It is because of practical reason - that DSLR was too heavy for me, especially for travelling.\nMany years ago mobile phone cameras were not as good as the current ones, and few people actually talked about the struggle between DSLR and mobile phone. But as we have seen in recent years, cameras on the phone are getting much more powerful - we have the triplets on iPhone 11 Pro Max, and on the Android side Huawei P40 is an absolutely strong candidate. The struggle is getting real.\nAt the end of the day, I cannot agree more with Sayantini\u2019s first point - the purpose. It really depends on one\u2019s actual needs. Why is that person taking photographs? Is he/she a professional photographer, an art student, or a leisure traveler? Different people will have different requirements, and thus different equipment will suit them.\nA professional photographer may require higher resolution, as the final product may be printed in large size. On the other hand, if a leisure traveller is just sharing photos with his/her friends and families, the ease of sharing may be of a greater concern than things like resolution or dynamic range.\nIn my newly started blog, I listed 3 advantages of using DSLR, and 3 advantages of using mobile phone. Feel free to read more if you are interested.\nPhone vs Camera - For travel photography? - TraPhoner", "The best camera you have is the best for you! Pretty clich\u00e9d, but true!\nThis is a tough one and has been a long time debate! But before we get into the discussion, we would want to assume certain parameters.\nPurpose : Basically, if one is just an enthusiast without much professional projects, a phone camera will do fine. Given how equipped they are these days and the ability to take a good picture isn't limited to the hardware. A seasoned photographer can ace it with a smartphone too! However, if you are interested in taking it up seriously, let's just say a DSLR is an important tool! There are many factors which contribute to a clean picture ( autofocus, focal length, aperture, bulk frames taken in a series all without crashing) , which might be essential. It would be wrong to say \u201cprofessionals do not use smartphone camera\u201d, but that is a rare event.\nGenre : Landscape, street photos, selfies, a bit of product photos, a smartphone can pull it off decently, however this only a fraction of what a DSLR might offer. If you need proper detailing, like light adjustments, bit of post precessing, moving objects, celestial trails etc a DSLR does those better.\nSensor : In a smartphone, the sensor is small. Even though you'll find how we can adjust the ISO in the manual mode, low light photos are tough to ace, especially the noise in the picture at a higher ISO. This can be stabilised in a DSLR as you will be able to control the amount of light entering.\nAperture and Focal Length : In a smartphone, the aperture is fixed which means you cannot control the depth of field to take a good shot. Even though you can adjust the focus for a front to back landscape picture or may be a shallow depth of field to isolate your subject, you know that it does look artificial to an extent, sometimes it's overdone. Even high end phones do a pretty good job, but sometimes the resolution or noise reduction algorithm is limited. Again, for focal length, its fixed and wider. One of the reasons why smartphone pictures are a bit restricted considering the perspective distortion of focal lengths. Which is why phones are perfectly reasonable for wide angle and good working distance shots. You can include macros too, but more than often the auto focus damages it all.\nAuto focus : These days, with the incorporation of image detection in smartphones, its not hard to focus on your subject. But what happens is moving objects tend to miss out upon details you would want from your picture. Sometimes, even with the properly adjusted shutter speed, it's hard to bring in much detail in a smartphone. Which ofcourse is a better bet with a DSLR.\nShutter speed : In a smartphone, the manual mode is embellished with a lot of aspects. Shutter speed is one of those magical parameters which you can use to time your perfect shot! And technically, the lesser the speed, the more clear and distinct the picture is (specially if its moving). What I have dealth with is you can't adjust the perfect speed with timing, either you have to be a bit slow or take it in a stack of frames together. These things are more detailed in a DSLR.\nPost processing a picture is more natural when it comes to DSLRs, where we can use post processing applications to edit out smartphone clicked pictures for an almost even comparison. As time advances, the present glitches with ISO, low light image quality, noise reduction algorithm at a higher ISO, sensors with a distinctive light sensitivity balance etc will also fall into place.\nBut then, it all boils down to one thing, what your purpose is after you have taken a good shot! As technology is improving, its obviously a sure shot competitor for a DSLR, but with a little less clarity in the images. However, we can only expect that would improve in the next 10 years!\nBut does that mean days of a DSLR are numbered? Highly unlikely! Smartphones won't supersede the quality offered by a DSLR, but we can obviously look out for some amazing changes for that one tool we carry around in our pockets!\nCheers!"], "topic_list": ["Mobile Photography", "Smartphone Cameras", "DSLR Cameras", "Photographers", "Digital Cameras", "Digital Photography", "Cameras", "Mobile Technology", "Photography", "Smartphones", "Survey Question"], "view_list": [87, 153], "create_time": "Apr 17, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Bhushan Bansode", "upvote_list": [1, 2], "question_title": "Do you still use a DSLR for photography as mobile phones have such great camera features?", "respond_collected": 2, "no_of_view": "1,351", "name_list": ["John Traphoner", "Sayantini Sen Choudhury"], "date_list": ["Apr 19, 2020", "Apr 17, 2020"]}, "384": {"ans_list": ["Generally groups that have a member with a dedicated center role almost always have the center in the middle on photos.\nCIX\nSpot the Jinyoung\nNow spot the Jinyoung on red carpet\n(to non FIX: he\u2019s the one with blue hair)\nNCT 127\nSpot the Taeyong\nNow spot the Taeyong on the red carpet:\nAlthough in Taeyong\u2019s case he also in the middle because he\u2019s the leader.", "I\u2019m gonna talk about EXO because I\u2019m an EXO fan.\nIn EXO, Kai is usually on the frontline or the center of their pictorials because he is the official visual of the group.\nAlthough I must say that everyone in EXO is a visual.

To the best of my knowledge, I don\u2019t. As a longtime Creative Cloud subscriber, I start all post-processing in Lightroom, only taking a file into Photoshop for things LR does not do (or do as well), specifically if I need layers. See Charles Haacker's answer to What is the effect of flattening an image in Adobe Photoshop?\nOther answers to this question tell me it may be necessary to flatten images for sharing or reproduction. My experience is that I need not do that, that when I send a file from Lightroom to PS, then save the image as a TIFF (or DNG) in Photoshop, it instantly appears alongside the original raw in Lightroom but without its layers. From there I can export (\u201csave as\u201d) the file/image as a JPEG for sharing or reproduction, no extra work needed.\nThe original raw retains its LR adjustments which can be changed any time\nThe processed TIFF will reopen in Photoshop with all its layers intact for rework anytime I choose\nThe exported JPEG has no layers (layers are not supported by JPEG) and is therefore basically flattened.\nI don\u2019t need to flatten the TIFF or PSD unless there is some compelling reason to save space on the drives. Flattening considerably reduces the file size at the expense of never being able to rework since the layers are gone.\nThere are times when I will make a copy of the layered file and flatten it, or merge some layers, to make it easier to do some final thing that is harder to do with all the layers intact, but that\u2019s a rare workaround that I use because I am still somewhere back on the slope of the Photoshop learning curve. There\u2019s a better way I\u2019m sure; I just haven't blundered into it yet.", "Because layers is a means for editing, an internal feature of Photoshop. It does not exist in common raster image delivery formats like JPEG, PNG, WebP, etc. So for compatibility you need to merge all layers into one.\nProfessional graphics apps support the original multilayer PSDs, but in some, via a sort of a cheat as they rely on a flattened preview stored in PSD (the better ones actually allow layer and layer comps manipulation).", "Mainly for printing/sharing with others.\nIf sending to a third party there\u2019s no guarantee that the layers will all show.

Even when shooting with a way to measure accurate color I normally tweak the color to be just a bit warmer than what the grey card or color card says is balanced. A perfectly color balanced file always looks a little boring to me, but you have to start somewhere.\nFirst off, you should be shooting RAW files. God forbid you\u2019re just shooting jpeg and don\u2019t realize until after that fact that your in the field color balance was wrong. I\u2019m not saying that shooting jpeg is bad but there are limitations which are difficult to work around when shooting only jpeg. Next you should choose the mode that you think will give you the most accurate color. I always avoid shooting with the auto white balance. You want all of your files shot in one location to have the same color profile. Using the auto white balance will create a problem in that regard.\nNext you want to identify something in your photo that represents a neutral tone, a grey or a white. A black will work as well. You can set the custom white balance using that tone but if it were me I would simply shoot a frame of that material in the same way that you would shoot your grey card or color card and then bring that file into your work process.\nI know a lot of people are doing all their edits in other programs but I still work out of photoshop. Process that file first and use it as your color balance file. In photoshop I process the file, pull a curve from the adjustment menu, choose the appropriate dropper (white, grey, black), sample the tone in question and look at the results. I almost always change the blending mode from \u2018normal\u2019 to \u2018color\u2019 especially when I\u2019m using a black as my sample. You don\u2019t want to tweak the overall exposure and contrast, just the color.\nKeep that file open and as you process your other files you simply drag the curves layer, and only the curves layer, from your sample file. Then tweak accordingly. Your images should then have a solid and consistent color balance.\nKeep in mind that a grey card is specifically made to only reflect 18% of a purely neutral color. A grey carpet or a grey or white wall does not necessarily reflect an absolutely neutral tone. Consumer whites in furniture, paint, flooring, etc have a lot of warmth and the greys you see in carpets or paints are all over the map. Some are really blue, others have a lot of magenta. It is more than likely that those colors when balanced as neutral will tweak all of your other colors out of whack, so be careful and be ready to pull that opacity slider back. I shoot a lot of convention spaces where there is generally A LOT of grey carpet. I\u2019ve made the mistake of somehow forgetting my grey card and color card kit and had to use the carpet as a substitute and though it\u2019s a starting point there is a lot more work going this route. If your starting point for color accuracy isn\u2019t great and you\u2019re dealing with a mixed lighting scenario you are in for a ride.\nAlways remember to bring your grey card!!!!", "If by white balance you mean correct exposure, then taking a reading off any mid-tone object such as grass or a road will give a reasonably correct guide.\nIf, on the other hand, you are referring to balancing the colour of the light, with a digital camera the easiest way is to take a shot at a normal daylight setting (if outdoors) then take a second image with the white balance setting adjusted to correct any colour cast.", "When I worked as a film photographer, I didn\u2019t have a gray card, BUT, I had my hand.\nOur palms are about the right shade of gray to substitute as a gray card.\nI metered on my palm and my photos really popped!\nBack in those days, and this could be true with digital cameras but IDK, is that an analog camera could film in an array of 10 shades of gray, but, the camera can only register 7 at one time. So it would be impossible to have white and black in the same photo. That\u2019s why Ansel Adams touched up his prints with white and black tints. You needed to decide what was more important in the photo; the whitest whites or the blackest blacks, or, take a bunch of pics at the various settings and see which one comes out the best in the darkroom. The third one is pretty expensive so better to learn what you want from a particular setting.\nAnd, as you hands are always with you, you\u2019ll always have some sort of gray to meter upon.", "An ordinary piece of white paper will suffice, or you can use a mobile phone app such as pocket light meter to determine light temperature."], "topic_list": ["Black and White", "Digital Photography", "Cameras", "Photography"], "view_list": [111, 51, 202, 33], "create_time": "Apr 18, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Bhavin Patel", "upvote_list": [1, 0, 0, 0], "question_title": "How do I set a white balance without a GREY card?", "respond_collected": 4, "no_of_view": "767", "name_list": ["Michael Taft", "Keith Crowther", "Cynthia Coleman", "Michael Benveniste"], "date_list": ["Apr 19, 2020", "Apr 18, 2020", "Apr 18, 2020", "Apr 18, 2020"]}, "465": {"ans_list": ["Cynthia (Onyedinmanasu Chinasaokwu) Erivo is an English actress, singer, and songwriter.

This is a requirement of an editorial image. But all other images by professionals are edited.\nI usually do nature and travel photography. My shoots usually last all day. I usually come home with anywhere from 100 to 1000 RAW files. I move all my RAW files from my camera\u2019s memory card to a folder on my computer\u2019s hard drive.\nI then import all the RAW files into Adobe Lightroom. In the first import screen I add general keywords. I also have a set of general keywords that are added during the first import of all RAW files.\nWhen I import the files into Lightroom\u2019s library I also have my own preset that does some light processing to all the images at the same time.\nThen I go through the images in the library and add specific keywords to each group of images according to what the images are about and what search terms I think customers will be looking for that relate to the image.\nThen I go through the images in the library and delete all the junk.\nThen I open one image at a time in the Develop module. I adjust lighting, color, noise, etc. Then I synchronize all those settings with all the other images taken at the same time of the same subject. This way I can bulk process many images at the same time.\nThen I examine each image separately for sharpness, lighting, color, etc. If the image is not sharp enough I delete it. If the image is not good enough I delete it.\nI also make sure the image is straight and that the horizon line is perfect.

These I open in Adobe Photoshop.\nIn Photoshop I clean any noise, spots, fine tune color, sharpness, saturation, lighting, etc. I will also remove unlicensed logos, people, graffiti, and other distractions in the image. I might also play with some images to change them to black and white or even to just leave one color object in the image. It depends on my mood and how much time I want to devote to the image.\nFor my favorite images I created a Photoshop action that reduces the size of the image to 18% of the original and downsizes it to 72dpi and adds my watermark. I click on that action and make reduced sized images that I can post on social media and my own website.\nThen I am done.\nFor some images that are conducive to this I import them into Luminar 4 and change skies, add objects, completely change lighting, etc.", "As a photojournalist, I edit my photos as little as possible. The job of a news photographer is to capture images that are an accurate and complete reflection of the reality of the moment.\nI use Lightroom to manage my very large archive. It consists of hundreds of thousands of RAW files, and tens of thousands of processed pics. Every processed picture, with very very few exceptions, contains metadata providing caption, title, creator, copyright, date and time, and in more recent photos, GPS coordinates, and of course the edit history.\nTypical edits consist of rebalancing exposure to even out the light, white balance, and cropping to improve the composition of the shot.\nI rarely do more than that, although for non-news modelling, I\u2019ll sometimes punch up the eyes by brightening the irises and removing any red, whiten the teeth a bit, and remove blemishes from the skin if necessary. Even then, I take a minimalist approach.\nSpot edits and any kind of airbrushing is taboo. Most new agencies will stop dealing with you if you are found to be materially altering the content of a photo. This is why it\u2019s essential to include an edit history in the metadata. You have to be completely transparent about this process.\nLightroom has some decent archive management features which make it easy to filter your photos to find specific people or events. But only if you take the time to include useful keywords, title and caption. Naming your finished files is also critical to being able to find them again.\nMy preferred format is to have a folder for every year, using the full 4-digit year. Inside that, each photo shoot is contained in a folder named for the date of processing using the yyyy-mm-dd format. That format will sort alphabetically as well as numerically, so it easiest to navigate.\nIndividual files are given longish but consistent names:\nlocation-subject-number.jpg\nSo a news shot taken in Sydney, Australia of the Premier of New South Wales would be:\nsydney-gladys-berejiklian-01.jpg\nThis way, I can retrieve the file photo from my archive either from within Lightroom using metadata, or I can simply use the POSIX find utility to dig it out.\nYou\u2019ll no doubt have noticed by now that I spend far more time worrying about being able to find my photos again than I do actually editing them. That\u2019s to save myself time and money. If I\u2019ve done my job properly, I won\u2019t have to edit them too much. And news agencies pay you for product, not for your time. The only way you can make a living is if you\u2019re exceptionally efficient. You generally need to be able to turn around photographic content on a very short timeline. In the most extreme cases, that means just moments after the photo is taken.\nSo the first rule of editing news photographs is: Take it well enough that you don\u2019t need to if you can.", "Professionals sort and cull first.

First you can place your camera on a sturdy tripod and use a very slow shutter speed. Depending on the situation, most modern DSLR cameras have a 30 second maximum time limit. Any longer and you must set your shutter speed on the \u201cB\u201d (Bulb) setting and use a cable release so that you can physically hold the shutter open indefinitely. Most cable releases have some sort of mechanism on them so you can you lock the shutter open for however long you want and not have to personally hold it.\nObviously, if there is any movement during the exposure either on the part of the camera or the subject, it will appear in the final image as a blur. You can see this effect in pictures of stars in the night sky and images of highways with nighttime traffic. The swirl and streams of light are beautiful!\nThe second thing you could do is boost your camera\u2019s ISO setting. This increases the sensor\u2019s sensitivity and light gathering capability. Many modern cameras have extraordinarily high ISO potentials such that you can shoot in almost total darkness. The downside of this is that you run the risk of generating \u201cnoise\u201d which appears as a very grainy look in your final image.\nOverall, shooting in low light can be a really fun experience and open up a wonderfully new dimension in creativity.", "Use a tripod, a remote trigger, and a slow moving subject.\nMake use of whatever existing light is available.\nUse a very slow exposure on non-moving objects.

The real reason Amish people don\u2019t like their photos taken is because they have strangers taking their photo like they are animals in a zoo. How would you like to be on a street and hear someone say ,, \u201cHey,, look at that strange looking guy,, take his picture as a souvenier.!\u201d You probably wouldn\u2019t like it. As far as I know, the Amish do not keep cameras or take photos as they also consider it to be vain. However, if you ask to take a photo for a legitimate reason, they might say \u2018yes.\u201d I don\u2019t believe it is actually against their religion. It\u2019s just something they don\u2019t do.\nA couple of years ago I was working my beat as a photographer. We have quite a few Mennonite colonies near where I live. They come into town looking pretty much like the Amish. Although they drive cars. The women all wear 1880\u2019s clothing and bonnets. There is a farmer\u2019s market and one group used to come and sell flowers. The one girl I thought was so cute. >She was about 12 years old. Wearing an 1880s dress and her hair in pigtails. I need photos for the newspaper. So I thought I would ask her and her sister,, who was older. Maybe 16. As I approached I thought that they might say no, as it might be against their religion. However, when I told them what I was doing they readily agreed. It occurred to me that in their community they won\u2019t have internet and probably don\u2019t even read newspapers. So the following week I brought them both a copy. The photo of the girls with their flowers was on the front page for that week. They were quite thrilled. Their mother was with them and smiled and thanked me for the effort of making sure they had a copy.\nThe difference here is I took their photo for a reason - not because they were curious looking.\nI also did another photo of a group of old order Mennonites ice fishing.

Push yourself a bit more everyday.\nFollow an easy morning routine\nDon't rush as you leave the bed. Keep enough time to perform your tasks steadily. Get up, make your bed, have a shower, have a nutritious breakfast, mix in some meditation and then, leave for your work.\nDrop the sugar\nSugar has lot of negative outcomes in it. It\u2019s better to opt black coffee or a green tea without a sweetener or get a bowl of fruits instead of having a cup of ice-cream.\nSo, next time you see any model with a cake piece, don't get misled. It's just for the sake of a pic !\nConcentrate on your diet\nDon't eat whatever you like or just because others are having it. Have an eye on what to eat and what not to. What to eat more and what to eat eat less. Check out the nutrients\u2019 values on the packet. Search for a healthy diet on the internet or get a personalised one from your dietician. It would be better if you cook a meal for yourself most of the time. By this, you will get to know about the eatables. Is their any better option for it ?\nAnd the biggest advantage - you'll become your own cook.\nRelease your stress\nStress is unavoidable in this chaotic life. It can damage your soul and mind if not handled well. It's better to release it soon as possible. Try some meditation, get some fresh air, roam in your garden or a park - remember a simple rule \u201csit less, walk more\u201d, take a shot at gardening, listen to motivational or uplifting beats, talk to your loved ones, play with kids, etc.\nKeep yourself hydrated\nDrink, Drink and Drink. Take healthy beverages. Your body requires 3 to 4 litres of water everyday. Set an alarm on your wrist band or mobile, if you can't keep a pace with it. Also, don't hold yourself for too long, micturate it as early as possible.\nTry to love exercises\nBetter to join a exercise class. Get some friends. It\u2019ll be fun then. Set a goal and complete it everyday. Don't forget to push yourself a bit more everyday. Get addicted to exercises.\nFootnote: 10 Habits That Will Keep You Fit Forever\nThanks for your time :)"], "topic_list": ["Daily Habits", "Models (fashion industry)", "Good Habits", "Fashion Modeling", "Habits", "Physical Appearances of People", "Beauty", "Photography", "Fashion and Style", "Psychology of Everyday Life"], "view_list": [207], "create_time": "Apr 17, 2020", "no_of_follower": 3, "question_author": "Vatsal Jain (\u0935\u0924\u094d\u0938\u0932 \u091c\u0948\u0928)", "upvote_list": [1], "question_title": "What habits do models follow to look incredible?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "1,634", "name_list": ["Jayant Kumar"], "date_list": ["Apr 19, 2020"]}, "244": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Photographs", "Photography"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 14, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Pinal Patel", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "What are some candid photos of Margaret Colin?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "140", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "206": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Photographs", "Photography", "Actors and Actresses"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 14, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Pinal Patel", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "What are some candid photos of Bette Midler?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "199", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "483": {"ans_list": ["We don't know what he looks like.

Doing this won\u2019t have harsh, light reflections. The closer to the glass your lens, the less reflection. Pros shoot through a black card or cloth that only the lens peeks through for no reflection.\nif you\u2019re outside, with no window reflection, or inside described above, the first priority is focus and speed. Autofocus if it\u2019s fast and covers the frame will help, but you should also try manual focus if you end up behind or it\u2019s in and out because of the busy little guy. You\u2019ll want to leave the background out of focus but you\u2019ll need a certain amount of depth of field to contain how far the busy bird is in the plane of your focus point. It takes a really fast shutter speed to freeze the bird, and even faster to freeze the wings.\nSo start at 250th for shutter speed and review your work. Remember shutter and aperture are fraternal twins. If you set your aperture at F5.6 at 250, if you go up to 500th, the aperture must in tandem opened to F4. Will F4 give you the depth of field you need? , you must keep reviewing your efforts. Remember, the closer focusing from a close distance, depth of field is reduced. Most likely you\u2019ll shoot at 2.8\u20135.6. A super fast lens at 1.4\u20131.8 will give you more speed to freeze their movement but at the edge of keeping the whole bird in focus. You may want to emphasize the fast movements. If that\u2019s the case you shoot at 60\u2013125. Instead of closing the lens down to match the slower shutter, lower the ISO so you can keep the aperture wider open in that 2.8\u20135.6 range. But again, the distance from camera plane to focus point will dictate the depth of field. I\u2019m assuming you have a normal focal length lens. Longer lenses will reduce depth of field at the same aperture while shorter lenses increase depth of field at the same settings. A tripod will help any shooting so you can concentrate on composing and having the security of knowing the camera is stationary. A monopod might be a good compromise so you are a bit more mobile than being on a tripod. If you lock down the camera on sticks, with the composition preframed, a remote release will free you up to look through the viewfinder and firing off exposures as the bird comes into the frame. Expect LOTS of misses but keep at it and the 1 out of a hundred could be just what you\u2019re looking for. Needless to say, all of the above is assuming you have great light on the bird. In shadow or low light will not resolve the detail and color that hummingbirds reflect. Place the feeder in a light path from the side or off camera but not backlighted. When outside keep the light over your shoulder if possible but there is more flexibility for backlighted or sidelight. A fill flash always help freeze movement and capture the image at a higher resolution. This is an ongoing subject effort so keep at it until you start seeing how the composition evolves and you\u2019ll get better at anticipating the birds behavior. What you see on nature video shows or editorial stills usually required months and sometimes years to get the light and composition right so don\u2019t get discouraged if you have unsatisfying results at first. Learn the light and adjust as you go.", "Put your camera in Tv mode ( shutter speed priority mode ) and on a sunny day without a flash i would say you start from 1/2000.

Fly.\nFLYS PEAK. Climbing, Hiking & Mountaineering : SummitPost\nFlys Peak is located in the far southeast corner of Arizona in a section of the Coronado National Forest. The peaks in the Chiricahua Mountains, where Flys Peak is located, approach 10,000 ft and provide a true \"sky island\" experience. Expect to drive and hike through numerous ecosystems as you approach Flys Peak. The Chiricahua Mountains are home to dozens of differnt animal species and are a stopover point an endless list of birds.\nFlys Peak is easily accessible by a variety of different well marked trails. The Chiricahua Mountains offer a welcome respite from the summer heat for many southern Arizonans and the forest service (as well as volunteers) do a wonderful job maintaining the 111 miles of trails that wind through canyons and up peaks. The Rattlesnake Fire in 1994 burned more than 25,000 acres on the west side of the range and although there are still many signs of the fire the area is beginning to make a full recovery.\nFlys Peak is often hiked in conjunction with Chiricahua Peak as it is about halfway along the crest trail if one starts from Rustlers Park. There is a well maintained trail to the top of the Flys Peak, and an opening in the trees at the summit that affords a nice view towards Chiricahua Peak itself. While combining the two peaks is a great way to spend a day, hiking to the summit of Flys Peak alone is a very worthwhile objective and would create a slightly shorter day of hiking.", "The answer is Fly's Peak, but it's location is in the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona vice Chihuahua."], "topic_list": ["National Parks of the United States", "Mountaineering", "Arizona (state)", "Hiking", "Mountains", "Geography", "Photography", "Military History and Wars", "The United States of America"], "view_list": [100, 8], "create_time": "Apr 14, 2020", "no_of_follower": 3, "question_author": "Jaime Almodovar", "upvote_list": [4, 0], "question_title": "Which peak in the Chihuahua Mountains in Arizona is named after a photojournalist, who captured the only known images of Apache Chief Geronimo, while still at war with the United States?", "respond_collected": 2, "no_of_view": "571", "name_list": ["Alan English", "Anonymous"], "date_list": ["Apr 15, 2020", "Apr 14, 2020"]}, "1182": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Photographs", "Photography"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 14, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Pinal Patel", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "What are some candid photos of Anita Briem?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "140", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "962": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Photographs", "Photography"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 14, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Pinal Patel", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "What are some candid photos of Jacke Harry?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "155", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "925": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Photographs", "Photography", "Actors and Actresses"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 14, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Pinal Patel", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "What are some candid photos of Olivia de Havilland?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "172", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "178": {"ans_list": ["They don\u2019t, they work only in Lightroom thus their name, \u201cLightroom Presets.\u201d"], "topic_list": ["Adobe Photoshop Lightroom", "Photo Editing", "Digital Photography", "Photography"], "view_list": [59], "create_time": "Apr 14, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Mohammad Alinia", "upvote_list": [0], "question_title": "How do Lightroom presets work in Capture One?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "534", "name_list": ["Darr Almeda"], "date_list": ["Apr 14, 2020"]}, "378": {"ans_list": ["Yes, I\u2019ve posed nude in one photo shoot.\nA female friend of mine was doing some photography and invited me to pose nude for her.

And for some reason, I just couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.\nIt\u2019s true that there are plenty of detractors that threaten to pull business from traditional, professional photographers.\nThey include, among other things:\nlots (and lots) of competition\ncamera phones\ntechnology and edits making photos easier for amateurs to digitally enhance on their own\nmisconception that photography is nothing more than \u2018point and shoot\u2019 work\nthe misnomer that anyone with a camera is a photographer\nthe increase in popularity of stock photos\nthe equipment is more complex, more costly\nbudgetary constraints\nBut these emerging roadblocks don\u2019t have to be brick walls.\nAll professions run unto challenges, and they present in many forms. Instead of throwing in the towel, you just have to forge ahead.\nWhen the going gets tough, some photogs don\u2019t know any better, and think that if they can\u2019t \u2018hurry up\u2019 and make money the traditional way, through sessions and shoots, that they\u2019re out of luck (and out of business). And that\u2019s just plain wrong.\nThat\u2019s why so many new photographers fizzle out before they\u2019ve even had a chance to really spark. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Getting clients is hard enough, but building a loyal following, well- that takes time. And time is money. Because the bills don\u2019t stop coming in when the business is slow, it\u2019s not a matter of failure, but rather, simply running out of time.\nHere are some tried and true ways to boost your bottom line, and your exposure right along with it:\nBrand yourself\nPhotography is one of the most rapidly growing fields around. With so much competition, having a strong brand is non-negotiable. In my branding business we work with photographers to create a unique brand presence, and that\u2019s helpful for sure. Everything you put in front of potential clients, from business cards to packaging and everything in between, should have a strong, enduring message. Something that\u2019s eye-catching, visually appealing, and instantly recognizable as your own.\nA professional brand shows people that you\u2019re deeply invested in your business and sends a subliminal message that you\u2019re serious about your work and passionate about your profession. But, don\u2019t settle for just any brand. And don\u2019t go with the latest trend. Sit down and really consider what you want your brand to say to the world. Make it your very own and keep it consistent throughout everything you do.\nEducate your Customers\nThere are two kinds of clients out there. Those who see the value in what you offer and those who don\u2019t. People are price conscious by nature. It\u2019s up to you to tell them what they\u2019re getting. Most customers who hire a professional understand and appreciate everything that goes into the work, and they gladly pay in exchange for it. Others\u2026 don\u2019t get it. They see a pricetag and wince. Their instinct is to flock to the lowest cost option. They wonder why they should pay so much more for you than, say, for a shoot over at the mall. A photo is a photo after all, isn\u2019t it?\nAbsolutely not.\nWhen faced with pricing objections, gently help people understand what they\u2019re truly getting in a custom, professional shoot. The time spent (both in preparation and during) a unique session, the artist\u2019s eye that goes into every shot, the painstaking editing to get every photo just right, the impeccable quality that professional equipment provides, the exquisite personalized customer service, and the unbridled creativity that a department store session just can\u2019t match.\nShare your work\nPut yourself out there. Share your work on your blog, across your social media channels. And don\u2019t be afraid to ask friends, family, and even the clients to share on theirs. People are so visual, an alluring image speaks volumes and is almost always sure to stop them in their scrolling tracks.\nTell a story\nIt\u2019s not just enough to share your images, you\u2019ve got to pair them with a story. The combination of the two is where the magic happens. A creative title for your post, share a little story (with client permission, of course). People want to know more about what they\u2019re looking at. Feel-good tales are always a hit. You can also enhance your images with inspiring words and quotes to amplify their Pin-ability. Be sure to include a link back to your photo blog, of course.\nGet business savvy\nCreatives, by nature, aren\u2019t huge fans if the behind-the-scenes, nitty-gritty business side of things. They prefer to spend their precious minutes capturing others\u2019 precious moments. Thankfully, there are some quick work-arounds.\nTo start, you can create photography documents (like contracts, releases, etc.) and pre-package them into branded folders to hand clients at the shoot. That way you don\u2019t have to piece them together on an as-needed basis. You can also use financial software to lessen the accounting load\nYour unique shortcuts will depend on your business model, but as with almost everything: there\u2019s a solution.\nControl expenses\nYes, you\u2019ve got to spend money to make money, but you\u2019ve also got to be smart about it. Whenever possible, work on a tight budget. Find creative ways to reduce the amount you spend on ancillary items. Digitize whatever you can. When possible send things via email versus print to save on postage and materials. The more you spend, the less you make.\nGet a specialty\nThe landscape is changing. You\u2019ve got to not only keep current, but carve out your own space. Do something no one else does. Or better yet, something no one else can. Find a way to set yourself apart from the crowd.\nYou can:\ncreate your own one-of-a-kind actions for unique editing finishes\ngather some unlikely props (think antiques or handmade items)\nput together a unique studio environment\nsecure the rights to a particular venue\n\u2026etc.\nDo whatever you can to develop a signature style. If you\u2019re the only game in town offering something- then you own every client that values it.\nBuild a following\nOf course you\u2019ve got to have people to build a business. But instead of individual shoots, work to forge relationships with each client you work with. You may even consider offering incentives for referral business.\nCreate Passive Income\nSimply put, passive income is money earned through multiple streams. That is, on ventures outside of your actual photography work. Things like the offering of evergreen products, the selling of tangible prints, reselling your work as reprints, and so many more.\nWhether you\u2019ve been in the game for years, or just got your first camera yesterday- passive income is a great idea. There\u2019s no one who couldn\u2019t benefit from additional streams of revenue and increased exposure.\nI created a resource called Peripheral vision that offers dozens of pages of passive income ideas, including lots of direct links to some pretty helpful resources to get you started. It\u2019s my sincere hope that this guide will help boost your bottom line behind the scenes, as you\u2019re out there doing what you truly love.\nGrab your copy, right here\nIt Ain\u2019t Over Til It\u2019s Over. And It Ain\u2019t Over.\nThe business of photography is not dying, it\u2019s evolving. It\u2019s learning to live in the new space that technology and advancement have created. And that\u2019s a good thing. Change doesn\u2019t have to be scary. It can be an opportunity. An opportunity to do something better and even more creative than you\u2019ve done before.", "Brandon has provided an excellent answer, and I could not agree more. Do allow me to supplement just a little bit.\nI do believe there are two main types of photography - one type concerns recording of facts, of events, or put it simply, documentation. The other type of photography is what I would call as artistic photography, or creative photography.\nWith the advent of technology, photographing has become easier. In the past we needed to load a roll of film, press the shutter, take it out, develop it, and print it. It takes hours. Nowadays, just take out your mobile phone, press the button, done. The intriguing fact is that some domains of photography require nobody at all. Think of aerial photography these days - satellite can kind of do the job. Many of those passport photo kiosks are unmanned. I would not say it is dying, but definitely some areas of photography are gradually being replaced by computers, by AIs.\nBut is creative photography dying? I do not think so. As I have written before\n, photography is a strong medium of communication. It carries meanings, thoughts, feelings of the photographer, that he or she wants to express. Can you replace this with AI? Probably not, I would argue. Artistic photography should still have its place in our society.\nWe often associate and view the word \u201ccareer\u201d monetarily. Right, it may be harder for photographers to make money these days than in the past. But dedicated photographers devote their time and efforts in photography. For them, photography is their career. Photography will never die.", "No .Always be pictures.", "Like many other careers, photography is being replaced by automation. \u201cPhotographer\u201d is rarely a job title any more; now it is one of the skills in the skill set. News photographers are definitely a dying breed: You show me a news reporter who can\u2019t take a decent photo with their cell phone and I\u2019ll show you a reporter who probably has other problems doing their job. They have an excellent new photography program at the nearby University of Missouri, but these kids have to learn video skills, reporting skills, ethics and all kinds of stuff. I don\u2019t know, someone fact check \u2014 how many jobs on the market titled \u201cphotographer\u201d vs how many jobs include \u201cphotography\u201d as a required skill?\nI do know that cameras are doing such a good job that I am constantly amazed! My five year old cell phone can photograph documents in lighting conditions where I\u2019d expect to need f 1.2 for a full second on a film camera with ISO 400 film. No, it\u2019s not a good image, but certainly better than I could have done with film, and with enough detail to be useful as a record.\nOf course, my cell phone does not always do a good job. Most people soon discover this and a few people decide they want a better photograph than they can get with their cell phone. Those few people (wild guess, 10%?) are the ones who provide the reason why photography is not a dying career. But it\u2019s not the glamorous career it used to be in the days of Stieglitz and Ansel and Dorothea.\nRealistic photography careers are designing, making, selling, servicing, or teaching how to use cameras. Probably based on a degree or certificate of some sort related to photography. Requires learning, building and maintaining skills and knowledge of photography.\nAlso still realistic are portrait photographers and wedding photographers; but these are usually more running a business than doing photography. The primary photographic skill is lighting and composition \u2014 camera will take care of the rest.\nLess realistic, but maybe more satisfying, are the careers where the business side is the building of a circle of patrons for your art. Most likely, however, if you succeed it won\u2019t be your photography, it will be how well you take care of the business side. But this is where it becomes worthwhile to actually become a master of the photographic image and the printing of such. Not very likely to pay very well; good idea to have another career standing by.

Agata Urbaniak has it 100% right: you are probably overexposing, plus if you have a filter on the lens that can cause flare, not glare but internal reflections from the filter. I never use them, but I always use a lens hood which avoids both flare and damage to the front element without interposing another glass-to-air surface.\n\u21d1 This is my best moon shot to date, made with a Sony A6300 with the equivalent of a 450mm lens. 1/125 sec, f/8.0, ISO 100, tripod mounted.\nLook at that exposure. Does it seem awfully short? It\u2019s the middle of the night, the clear sky is black, what did my averaging meter probably say for f/8? 1/30? 1/15? More? An averaging reflected meter, the one in your camera, wants to expose so as to make everything average out to gray, specifically middle-gray or 18% reflectance.\nSo your averaging meter \u201csees\u201d and \u201creads\u201d the scene as gray (though it is not), overexposing the black sky and waaaaay overexposing the bright moon.\nThe Looney f/11 rule-of-thumb estimates the correct exposure for the full moon without a light meter.\nUse the reciprocal of your ISO for your shutter. At ISO 100, use 1/100 or 1/125. If you need a faster shutter, you can open up or increase your ISO, or both.\nShoot at f/11 (I shot at f/8\u2014slight overexposure is fine, esp. if shooting raw)(For daylight photography, there is a similar rule called the Sunny 16 rule-of-thumb.)\nThis may be of interest. What do you do when you have a foreground object you want for reference but it\u2019s too dark for a single exposure to get both?\nThe frame on the left was exposed for the moon alone, 1/100 sec. f/8.0 ISO 200. This was the basic shot, camera on a tripod, Nebraska capitol tower in foreground but at infinity from 5 blocks away, the moon rising from behind it, also at infinity.\nBut if I expose for the moon the tower is nearly as black as the sky. If I expose for the tower the moon blows out.\nThe center frame was exposed for the tower, 1/8 sec. f/8.0 ISO 200. The tower looks great but now the moon is this featureless glary blobby thing due to overexposure by about 4 stops. The halo around it isn\u2019t atmospheric; it\u2019s flare from the overexposure bleeding out around the disc.\nThe one on the right is a little Photoshop magick (or any app capable of layers). I took the correctly exposed moon, adjusted it (it was too dark), and enlarged it just enough to fit over the blown-out moon including the halo.\nThat third frame is the one I set out to get. I knew it could not be done in a single frame because of the 4-stop difference in luminance. The only way to get it at all was to, um, cheat? I guess? The moon was actually there in the frame; it just needed a little help to get the details.", "There are 2 possible issues here. First, the moon is much brighter than people think it is. You might be overexposing your image. Try shortening your exposure time. Maybe stop the lens down a little to achieve a sharper image. Second, if you're using any sort of protective filter on your lens, take it off.

The second explosion seems to have been observed and followed for several years since the 2016 detection. That it has lasted that long is indicative it is very odd.\nThere is not a lot of value in a picture of a supernova. What is much more useful are things like the energy rise over time (brightness) and the decay time. At 3.6 billion light years away, it will always only be a dot.\nIf Betelgeuse goes off in your lifetime, it will be much more photogenic as it is almost next door, astronomically speaking, at just 700 light years. Get your camera ready - you should actually be able to see that one! But be grateful it is 700 light years away. If it was only 50 light years it might well have had a bad effect on Earth.", "Who said there is none?\nIn the article is a link to the study.\nIf you click on it you'll get the free pdf.\nIf you look at the first page you can see three observations made of the supernova and its host galaxy.", "There are - you just need to have access to the HST data archive", "I am sure there ARE pictures (or \u2018visualisations\u2019 if it was only observed on radio telescopes) but the images may not be that spectacular, and for a magazine article a tiny spot against a black background is not really that impressive - an artist\u2019s representation IS.", "Because it happened 3.6 billion light years away.

P.S - This photo was a challenge. Firstly we searched\u2026\u201d\nWithin a week of purchase of my TVS apache rtr 160, this photo was taken. Being a photography enthusiast myself, I wanted something different on my profile about my new bike rather than just a bland photo. Thinking about this, the thought of steel wool photography striked my mind. Many of you might know this, but for those who don't, it is a technique where steelwool, a very thin type of scrub pad(used for utensils cleaning) is kept inside a hollow metal cage attached to a long wire or rope. We burn the steelwool and rotate the rope in the desired shape which is exposed to camera on slow shutter. This photo was taken at khadakwasla, Pune and steelwool was very difficult to find. Once we found a perfect spot where no one would disturb us, we got to work. We setup the bike and camera. Turned on the timer and quickly my friend siddhant came behind the bike, burnt and rotated the rope. We took many different shots but the best was selected and edited. Many undesirable things happened during this shoot. Firstly, the steelwool was really difficult to find, we found it on the way to khadakwasla in a dark suspicious alley. Secondly, the traffic was so much, that my parents gave me a good scold after returning home. Also the amount of shots we took were less as the excess steelwool accidentally caught fire due to our carelessness. But ya, inspite all this, we got this shot and it was totally worthit. We literally danced after reviewing the photos out of happiness.\nP.S. - This is my first answer on quora, also, me being an engineer, mechanical I'm not very good at \u201cwriting\u201d so if any mistake in grammar or spelling or in answer as such literature' illy, please ignore.\ud83d\ude01", "It is usually me taking the pictures, so while I have lots of images of other people cycling, I have had a struggle to find any of myself.

The reference to an \u201cimage\u201d suggests the statement is trying to express some thought about geometrical optics, so maybe, in this context, \u201cbeam\u201d may be a poorly chosen word to refer to what optical scientists call a \u201cray\u201d. Geometrical optics is based on ray-tracing.\nA \u201csingle plane wave\u201d is a well defined concept in physical optics. It is not the same thing as a beam, because a beam has a defined location, but a plane wave is theoretically everywhere. A plane wave may be defined by any number of rays. Each ray is perpendicular to the wavefronts, i.e. runs in the direction of propagation of the wave. Since the wave is plane, all rays that describe it are parallel. In geometrical optics, this means that the rays emanate from an object that is a single point at infinity.\nOf course, the part of a plane wave that impinges on a lens ceases to be a plane wave. Then, ray tracing is a useful way to find how the wave is changed by the lens, in the approximation of neglecting the effect of diffraction.\nIf the lens is a theoretically perfect converging lens, then all the rays that pass through the lens\u2019s entrance pupil will upon emergence through the exit pupil converge to a single point in the back focal plane. There will therefore be a real image in the back focal plane that consists of a single point of light, with chromaticity identical to that of the point object at infinity.\nIf the lens is a theoretically perfect diverging lens, then all the rays that pass through the lens\u2019s entrance pupil will upon emergence through the exit pupil diverge from a single point in the front focal plane. There will therefore be a virtual image in the front focal plane that consists of a single point of light, with chromaticity identical to that of the point object at infinity.\nThe statement \u201cthere is no pattern in the image\u201d is an aesthetic, rather than scientific, judgement. I would say that an image that consists of a single point of light has the strongest possible pattern, i.e. has entropy of zero, because every illuminated point in the image is in the same place.\nMaybe in context that statement is meaningful, but as it appears here, I find it to be only a poorly expressed statement about an elementary fact of geometrical optics.", "A photo commonly has multiple pixels, dots with a color and intensity. What would a photo look like if it was entirely shaped by a single wave or beam of light. It would be a single color, there be no interesting variation.\nThat does happen, for instance in space telescopes. Many items that are very far away are literally a single pixel.

It is best to start with a very short focal length, 15mm or so. Rokinon makes some good modern manual focus lenses.

Without a tracking mount, a longer lens is only good for shooting the moon.\nIf you already have a kit zoom, use that and spend your money on a good tripod and large ball head.

Yes you will need a tripod and a nice dark area well away from the city lights and choosing a time then there is No Moon will also help.

I have a Canon 100D and my price range is \u00a3100-\u00a3200, I don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s second hand.\nA - The Canon 100D is 2013 technology, long before BSI (Backside Illumination) became available and this is an APS-C camera, not a full frame. That means that your camera is a bit too old for easy low light astrophotography. And zoom lenses are generally very slow/not recommended for astrophotography.\nI\u2019d suggest getting a used 14mm lens that is reasonable fast. 14mm is by far the most popular focal length for Milky Way astrophotography and is good for other types of astrophotography such as those by Rokinon, Samyang, etc. You want manual focus, not autofocus (and that will save you money). Used Cameras, Lenses & Gear For Sale\nis a good place to look.\nAnd I\u2019d suggest you make or buy some form of a tracker. They run new for about your price range and up. Beyond that get a full blown astronomy telescope with active tracking. However barn door trackers are easy to make.

It was used in a darkroom, using a red safety light that wouldn\u2019t affect the printing paper so you could see what you were doing. The height of the enlarger head would be raised or lowered depending on the size of the print you wanted to make. You would make a test print by uncovering strips of the paper for different lengths of time to find what was the best exposure. You could adjust highlights and shadows using a technique called dodging and burning. The print would then be developed and fixed in trays and rinsed and dried.\nThat is a simplification of the process, but good printing was both an art and a craft and a fair bit of science too.

If you know what images you want to enlarge, you can skip this stage entirely.\nEnlarger.\nContact printing involved only the lamp and the baseboard. Enlarging means placing an individual image in the film carrier, focusing the image on the baseboard, and then placing a new photo paper of the correct size before finally exposing it.\nThen that paper is exposed to the chemicals again, and the image appears.\nSlides are special, and are only developed. They are then projected. Printing them requires a special process.\nThe development of the film can be done rather easily in any home, but the enlarging process requires a lab.

This comes from experience. To restrict yourself from shooting at certain times of the day shows that you lack understanding of the effects that certain light has on subject matter. When I was shooting years ago for a team at the Indianapolis 500 there were many days that practice was held right around noon. Everyone on the team wore either a helmet or a ball cap so shadows were always a problem for the face area. The solution was to learn fill flash techniques that were consistent and repeatable. I got to be really good at this technique. It is all in knowing your gear and using it to its best advantage. Cheers!", "12 O\u2019clock noon is the best time of day to photograph outdoors, for some subjects. There is one hard and fast rule concerning light vis a vis photography. The rule is, one needs some quantity of light in order to make a photograph. That is the only rule that is inviolate.\nWith the right set-up, 12 noon is perfect for portraits. I did a number of them when I was working, one just needs some competency in knowing how to work with the light, that\u2019s all. The only limitation is one\u2019s background.\nAt this point in photographic history I cannot imagine how a competent photographer does not know the simple techniques for photographing a portrait at 12 noon.\nDo not misunderstand, at other times during the day near June 21st there are easier set-ups for portraiture. But really, how complicated can it be? It takes less than 10 minutes to set-up a beautiful lighting solution for an outdoor portrait at 12 noon.\nBut you were not specific about what you were photographing and the subject matters.\nExcept for a few places on this planet even on June 21st the sun isn\u2019t actually directly overhead. It however, does offer some challenges.\nThe purpose of the image dictates the set-up. A big part of the set-up is lighting. A huge chunk of being a photographer is knowing how to work with light. No matter what time of day or night (moon light) the light is in fact crossing or back lighting something.\nOne can shoot good pictures at any time of the day as long as there is some light.\nThe image above is shot in raw sunlight, with no fill at all at roughly midday.", "Currently I\u2019m getting 40 views a day visiting a blog post I wrote on this subject: Best and Worst Time of day to take Outside People Pictures in the Summer.\nI originally wrote it so I could direct my clients to the page when they wanted to have me do portraits of them in and around noon time. Seems that is the time most convenient for many. It is not that I can\u2019t do portraits at that time - it just narrows the locations available. I wanted to educate my clients and hope they could make better time choices. And if not, at least they understand why a certain location is maybe not so good at that time.\nSince I was getting so many visits I decided create a free course on the subject - mostly for those that want to take better portraits with their smartphone at anytime of the day. It consists of 6 videos and in a few days will include a downloadable E-Book for those that sign up for the course.\nAnd to answer your question, anytime of day is a good time to take people pictures. You just need to know how!", "Well by then the models are muchore relaxed and actually have a good time after taking off those clothes. Good luck", "I know shooting outdoor photography around noon is no good, but is 2:30pm or 3:00pm far away enough from noon to shoot good photos? Sure. Even shooting at high noon can work. Like everything else, it depends.\nI dislike hard-and-fast rules. I\u2019ve actually gotten into verbal tiffs with folks over the Almighty RULE of Thirds \ud83d\ude44. I\u2019d prefer to call it and other \u201crules\u201d merely suggestions or guidelines. Off-centering a subject can improve the composition, but it can ruin it just as quickly.\nShooting in noon bright sun usually means very high contrast. For some subjects that works wonderfully; for others not so much.\nI think the first thing any photographer has to learn is how to see light. We all see things with light, but most of us never really study the light itself, its intensity, direction, character, color, the shadow it casts, and many other things.\nThe time of day matters less, or not at all if there is overcast. There\u2019s thin overcast, where you can still see the sun but its light is diffused. The overcast gets heavier and the disc disappears into a bright spot behind the cloud. It gets heavier still and you can no longer determine where the sun is; now the light is dim but very uniform. The contrast is extremely low, very little difference between highlight and shadow.\nTake your eye off the clouds and look at the landscape. Overcast diffuses the sunlight. The heavier the cloud cover the softer the light. Look at the shadows (very important): full sun casts deep, dark, sharp-edged shadows; thin overcast makes the shadows more open with less sharp edges. The character of the shadow can tell you a lot about the character of the light.\nThere are some fashion photographers who have begun shooting models in full bright sun. The models are forced to squint. I think it\u2019s dreadful but it\u2019s also different, which is the point, and anyway, the crisp light really shows off the textures of the fabrics; art directors don\u2019t care if the model looks uncomfortable; they care about the clothes.\nIf you are trying to shoot portraits or family groups in full noonday sun, the sun is hardly ever dead overhead, casting a shadow straight down. You can turn your subjects so they are in their own shadow. The hair is very bright but their faces are more relaxed, especially if they can look into a shaded area. I\u2019m not advocating anyone do this; it\u2019s still horrible light from my viewpoint, but you can bounce light back into the faces with a reflector, or shoot a fill-in flash to open the shadow, balance the light better, and cut some of the hot hair. And yes, the later you wait into the afternoon the lower the sun gets and makes everything easier, on you, and your subjects.\nA better bet, if it\u2019s high noon or nothing, is to get your people into open shade, the edge of a wood, the shadow of a structure, anything that is lit by an area of sky but with no direct sun getting in.\n\u21d1 A dear friend of mine out birding. The full unfiltered sun is directly behind him, to my camera right, and quite harsh with sharp shadows, but he is looking into the woods so his face is fairly relaxed.\n\u21d1 On the other hand, this is about noon but there is heavy overcast. The light is flat and note especially that there is no shadow at all.\n\u21d1 This was later in the afternoon but the women were in full sun, except it was coming from behind them, about 3/4 backlit. Their faces are relaxed because they are looking into a shaded area but the sun illuminates their translucent fans.\n\u21d1 These women are standing in open shade. The light is coming from the sky above and to their front but there is no direct sun getting in except for a little mottle in the trees behind them.\nSo sure, depending on your subjects high noon may not be the best time to shoot, and the longer you wait (or the earlier you get out) the lower sun usually gives a more pleasing light, but learning to read and interpret light goes a very long way to making best use of the light you have.", "Time is not the measure. Angle of the sun is what dictates the light on your subject. The angle of light at noon in July is almost directly overhead and very strong shadows casting down in unflattering depths. The same time in October is much lower, further away and casting light in a much better angle. Generally that\u2019s why a rule of light are the golden hours which are a couple hours after sunrise and before sunset depending on the time of year. Also direct light favors structures while indirect light favors people. But that is a general rule. A good shooter can work with great light but it has to be at a favorable angle. That\u2019s why it\u2019s often a waiting game to get the right shot.", "Rules help create correct photos, but not necessarily good ones. They should never stop you from taking photos. Agata Urbaniak's answer to Are the best black and white photographs those taken in bright sunlight?", "It is ridiculous to think there\u2019s any time of day that is \u201cno good\u201d for photography or there are times of day that are \u201cgood\u201d. This attitude indicates one doesn\u2019t truly understand light or photography.\nSome of my most profitable photographs were made at high noon or within 15 - 20 minutes either side of high noon, precisely because the shadows created at that time gave the subject depth and volume which better explain the subject than more flat light at other times of day.\nThe whole business with the morning and evening \u201cGolden Hour\u201d for landscape photography is predicated on the long, dramatic shadows created by the low sun angle. However other subjects look like crap with a low sun angle.\nThus, like most this way or that way situations in photography - IT DEPENDS!", "The answer to your question depends upon a few variables. Time of year, weather conditions, and location. In general, when you read about creative photography you hear about a term they call the golden hour. That hour of the day provides low angle, warm color light. It\u2019s very attractive and works well. When I photograph waterfalls for instance, I prefer a light cloud cover. That gives me soft wrap around light, much like a softbox. It also does not give me bright patches of sunlight, and deep dark shadows. Something I like to avoid. Under these conditions I can use a long (1/2 to 1 second) shutter speed to get that silky water effect I like. I have also found that a light overcast works well for outdoor portraits.

It's the I, II, and III versions. Some are from before WW2, some from not long after. The last models overlap with the first Leica M - the M3. They were revolutionary and made the 35mm film into a standard.\nSome of the models were very popular at the time, sold in large quantities, and because of their superior build quality are still working to this day. My 1936 Leica III works beautifully and is a joy to use.\nProbably the easiest to get and the cheapest would be the IIIc. There were over 130.000 of them made. Don't get tempted by the sexier and rarer black versions. They are selling for more nowadays but at the time were actually slightly cheaper economy models compared to the chrome version. You can have a body for \u00a3100\u2013150 and use any LTM lens on it. They are cheap and abundant, not just Leica but Canon, Voigtlander, and Russian Jupiter or Industar among others.\nI got my Leica III for \u00a3280 with the collapsible Elmar 50mm f/3.5. When collapsed, it barely sticks out more than a body cap would. Together with the remarkably small compact body it can easily fit in a coat pocket.\nIf you are after a film M camera, with a little patience you can find a Leica M5 for less than any other M. It was the first Leica with a built-in TTL lightmeter. It was also the last Leica being manufactured in the Wetzlar factory. It was a flop but not because it wasn't a great camera. Leica put a lot of thought into its redesign. What they didn't predict is the Leica users didn't want their beloved Leica redesigned. M5 is larger than the other Ms, especially width-wise. It has both strap lugs on one side (later ones had a 3rd lug added on the other side). It has a built-in lightmeter. It was manufactured to the highest standard and at the time it was expensive even for a Leica. Photographers rejected it and even nowadays it's a bit forgotten/overlooked. If you're not precious about having a Leica that doesn't quite look like a Leica, I'd highly recommend it. I got mine off Ebay for \u00a3500.\nThe cheapest digital Leica M is the M8. It's not full frame but a slightly smaller APS-H sensor size. It is known for being way too sensitive to infrared light which is the reason many photographers use it for IR photography. Others use a filter to correct it. It takes M-mount lenses that have been around since the 50s, and LTM lenses with a simple adapter ring (the rangefinder coupling is the same). If you're a little patient you can find one for around \u00a3900.", "Why you ask this question? Many asked me this questions because they think by having Leica (which is expensive) they will take great picture. But the truth is not the camera that matter (although it help), but is your composition and concept behind the picture that you took.\nLeica is a fine tool, if you use it right it produce stelar result.

The could make amazing changes, but it took hours of work.", "Before the days of computers and digital photography, how would one alter a picture after it was taken? Other answers and comments already here show there were many ways to alter, post-process, retouch, and enhance pictures. I had a studio where I made hundreds of simple, straightforward business headshots in black and white. The dedicated camera I used was a retired school camera with a fixed 10-inch Taylor-Hobson Cooke portrait anastigmat that took 5x7-inch sheet films in a dividing back making two 3x5\u2033 negatives on a single sheet. Those negatives were large enough to retouch directly on the negative using various tools and techniques.\n\u21d1 Adams Retouching Machine, 1947. I bought my studio from a retiring photographer and acquired this little godsend with it. It made retouching directly on the negative easier, smoother, and less detectable than the older method of simply (but painfully tediously) totally manual method. A negative that took hours to skillfully retouch by hand could be retouched in under an hour with this machine that vibrated the negative in the carrier in a predictable pattern. I learned how to use it and (unproductively it turned out) spent too many hours ruining my eyesight by retouching every large negative myself.\n\u21d1 This before-and-after pair came straight out of my sample drawer. I showed it to headshot clients as a demonstration of what I could do. All the skin smoothing you see was done directly on the original negative using dyes and drafting leads of various hardnesses. The leads (graphites) were drawn to a needle point in folded sandpaper. Held lightly by thumb and forefinger the point was used to shade in lighter areas (shadows) to match the surrounding skin tones. The machine made it easier, less tedious and time-sucking.\nThe eyeglass glare was a different story.\nOn the negative, those reflections are black, blocked with developed silver. To eliminate them directly on the original negative required that I remove density using an etching knife. This was far trickier than adding density with graphites and dyes, and a serious goof simply ruined the master negative so it was nerve-wracking as well. But these business portrait headshots were almost always called upon for multiple prints, even reorders, so carefully dying them down on individual prints was simply not practical. It made sense to alter the master which, once completed, could simply be printed again and again.", "Most people did not alter images. If you needed to crop you used scissors. Actual editing was done with artistic means. Soviets were famous for that.\nThe printing quality was so poor that the edits were easy to hide.", "When I was a child in the 1940\u2019s color print film and color printing papers had a very short life before they began to fade. Exposing color prints to sunlight, even for a few days, could seriously degrade the picture quality. As a consequence most photographers, who wanted to have their photos endure, worked in black and white. If a client wanted a color portrait, the photographer had an artist color the black and white print with stable color paints. I have a hand-colored print that was taken of me as a child and the colors are still vivid many decades later. That process was, of course, labor intensive and expensive but it was quite effective.\nLater color films and printing papers were introduced that were more stable but there were limitations to what could be done to alter the print in a darkroom. That is when airbrush artists stepped in. The print or large negative could be altered by an airbrush artist. As an example, I did a color portrait of a church building that they would be using on the cover of their weekly bulletin. There was no way that I could take a photo of the front of that church building without including ugly power and phone lines in the frame.\nI enlisted the services of an airbrush artist who not only \u201celiminated\u201d those ugly power and phone lines, she added blooms to azalea bushes since we were past their booming season.

Again, if you use the full image, you have just replaced the need to buy the image or buy the newspaper it was in, or go to the website where it was found and see the ads there. You are destroying the commercial market for that image.\nAfter that, it gets a little easier. Sort of. There are many allowed \u201cpurposes\u201d for using someone else\u2019s original content.
