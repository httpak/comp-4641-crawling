I, personally, am on Lithium and it helps for the most part. But where it doesn\u2019t work, I have to focus on my coping skills and/or behavior modifiers to help in the regulation of thoughts and emotions. I am currently in DBT (Dialectic Behavioral Training) classes. These are of a great benefit as well. Here are a few techniques that I have learned thus far. Some might not apply to you now, or even at all, but its good to have them as a reference point in case you need them down the road.\nLet your senses take hold of your reality. In doing so, you are controlling what type of stimuli that is being born into the front cortex of the brain where the frontal cortex has a very finite space of what can occupy it. Let your eyes watch the clouds floating by. Let your nose smell the flowers. Allow your ears to hear the birds off in the trees. And allow your feet to feel the rocks between them. Be one in that moment \u2014 no past to fend off, nor future to worry about. Just you, right there, taking in the moment that is.\nAnother technique, still utilizing the science about the limited space in the frontal cortex \u2014 Counting by numbers. I, personally, start with 7\u2019s. But if you are stronger in math than what I am (I presume that you are), pick a number(s) for you that are going to be hard. For this technique to work, you have to get the brain completely focused on this process.\nQualifiers versus Disqualifiers: This one is tricky, and will need continued help from a therapist for you to master it. But it never hurts to start in the here and now. Understand, where the previous techniques dealt specifically for anxiety attacks, this one directly deals with depression. And my depression is severe so I will be drawing on personal situations for this one.\nOne of the negative thoughts that constantly bombards my brain, and has the potential of ruining my day, would be \u201cI hate my life.\u201d Right here, in this moment, you have to stop what you are doing and examine the statement. Just allowing it to fester is not going to change the outcome. Ask yourself \u2018why do I hate myself/my life?\u2019 Better emotional health and mental wellbeing comes from examining the how and whys, as well as the when and where. So from here my mind would throw up either repressed memories or caustic memories on an endless loop. If you can, examine one for whatever is there that you need to process through. If you can\u2019t, it being too much in the moment, then use the above techniques to come out of the cycle that you are in.\nThere are no absolutes. With each thought, with each memory, there is more than just the negative side. \u201cI really cared about her, why was I such an asshole during the breakup? We will never speak again because of what I have done.\u201d\n1. Breakups are always hard, but\n2. you are allowing your mind to focus on the negative rather than the positives that came out of the situation.\nSo where you feel one way in the moment, there are different truth to be garnered from the situation, so the previous statement is what you have to disqualify as not being empirically truth. Disqualifiers are easier for me to process through. \u201cI am worthless\u201d is one that I can say a lot, but that\u2019s not true and here\u2019s why \u2014 I reach out to aid my community, care for those within my life, play a vital part in the continued upkeep of my apartment complex.\nAnother frequent negative though I have would be \u201cYou will never find love,\u201d really? I am still at a good age, reasonable physical health, a heart that cares, and the goal of aiding others living with mental illness so pick any one of these truths and tell me that that statement is true. Qualifiers more along the lines of \u2014 \u2018I am starting to look old,\u2019 but you change the negative thought by adding on \u2018I am starting to look old BUT I can start using face lotion on a daily basis to help my skin to look better.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m not as smart as my peers, BUT I can allot a certain allot a certain amount of time in my day to become well versed in current affairs\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t have the degrees and/or accolades that Tom has, BUT I can go to night school and improve upon the accomplishments that I already have.\u2019\nEven in dealing with mental illness \u2014 I, personally, suffer from ADHD, bipolar 1, severe depression, PTSD, anxiety issues, and agoraphobia \u2014 you still control the narrative of your life story. It takes time and effort, but ultimately its you that's in control. If you aren\u2019t already in some type of therapy, I would encourage you to do so for a variety of reason. But the main one is to have someone to be there for you while you take these crucial steps forward toward personal progress.\nThere is always a next step to take. Remember that \u2014 there is always a next step to take. So if you falter or fall, you have within you the ability to stand back up. It might take a minute, an hour, or even a day to do so, but you have to allow yourself that time to stand back up and take those crucial next steps forward. As long as you are moving forward, there will be further progress and greater awareness of how to achieve better mental health and wellbeing.\n2 views \u00b7 Answer requested by Elle Cohen\nUpvote\nShare"], "topic_list": ["Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder", "Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)", "Psychiatry", "Understanding and Improving Mental Health", "Mental Illness", "Problem Solving", "Psychology", "Mental Health", "Health", "Medicine and Healthcare"], "view_list": [75, 73], "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "no_of_follower": 3, "question_author": "Farooq E Subhan", "upvote_list": [2, 3], "question_title": "What can you take, consume, or follow to help solve PTSD?", "respond_collected": 2, "no_of_view": "739", "name_list": ["Jake Colvin", "Trent Andary"], "date_list": ["Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"]}, "537": {"ans_list": ["All", "The area is the same"], "topic_list": ["Psychology", "Studying", "Human Behavior"], "view_list": [1, 3], "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "no_of_follower": 4, "question_author": "Noah Cardoza", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "question_title": "What area of psychology studies dysfunctional behavior?", "respond_collected": 2, "no_of_view": "639", "name_list": ["Fielding Pierce", "Bernie Ball"], "date_list": ["Apr 27, 2020", "Apr 27, 2020"]}, "677": {"ans_list": ["What Hitler \u201chad\u201d according to Otto Kernberg was the malignant form of patholigical narcissism.\nA construct that essentially consists of three different personality disorders \u2014 narcissistic, paranoid and anti-social personality disorders along with sadistic aggression, this is essentially a machavellian psychopath with little to no capacity for compassion or empathy.\nKernberg flat-out used the term \u201cevil\u201d when describing the construct of malignant narcissism and while obsessive-compulsions are a symptom of Hitler's overall pathology, they certainly do not comprise anywhere near the entirety of the pathology."], "topic_list": ["Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD)", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)", "Adolf Hitler", "Abnormal Psychology", "Nazi Germany", "Personality Disorders", "World War II", "Mental Illness", "Psychology", "Mental Health"], "view_list": [105], "create_time": "Apr 30, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Ryan Shutkever", "upvote_list": [2], "question_title": "Did Hitler have Obsessive Compulsive personality disorder?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "458", "name_list": ["Peter Samuel"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020"]}, "364": {"ans_list": ["Most frequently our President says \u201cwe\u201d when he truly means his administration, his C-19 TEAM.

They also just have a low moral hygiene and capacity for virtue, period. Virtues like honour, grace, courage, discipline, patience, etc, are lacking in narcs. Although they can manage to attain some semblance of virtue in areas relating to success, on the spiritual or even just basic social/community respect sphere, virtue is a thing to \u2018master feigning\u2019, and not to attain.\nEmotions which are of a collective nature, like a sense of comraderie on a baseball team, that warm fuzzy happiness of unity which accompanies community events or family gatherings, the feeling of wanting someone else\u2019s success as if it was your own, like if they\u2019re on a game show or something, the connection two lovers or even good friends get while talking about something and realizing that they feel the same way about the topic, or are on the same wavelength as each other. The joyful giggles and laughs and warmth that comes from finishing another\u2019s sentence. The utter sense of completion, the warmth, fuzziness and love, of holding someone you \u2018care for more than yourself\u2019, to sleep. The myriad imaginative feelings of sharing a world half created half real with a lover who is also artistic like you. That vulnerable feeling, when you\u2019re scared, a bit sad and happy, because in that moment you see all the tragedy, beauty, misery, wonder and bliss of human life, while holding your newborn baby for the first time. A myriad of subtle but very beautiful trances, impressions, sensitive-nuanced-dreamlike emotions which are fleeting but then leave a lingering aftertaste of their vague effect coupled with the peculiar inner search through forgotten memories and mental back-corners, as you try to bring the fleeting feelings into full light.\nNow I was about to get into the emotions felt in dreams, but I don\u2019t know their names, mostly, or how to describe them, and I think narcs actually do feel these.\nEverything mentioned above, it\u2019s not to say that no narcissist ever felt any of those things. They can feel a host of those things, but 1) not all together like empaths do, 2) not to the same degree as empaths, 3) And most importantly, it\u2019s not a matter of \u2018capacity to feel\u2019 but of \u2018significance given to the feeling.\u2019 For example, everyone dreams but many people can\u2019t remember their dreams. People who are more emotional and enjoy subtle feelings, or are artistic, tend to remember dreams much more because they give significance to the dreams. A businessman may think nothing of a dream\u2019s importance and so remember very few dreams. Similarly, a narcissist would remember feeling many of the emotions and feelings I described above throughout his/her life, but since there would be little value or significance added to \u2018anything non directly self-serving\u2019 to the narc, he/she would hardly remember the feeling, be able to describe it, or care to feel it again. Especially the social emotions, these would be seen as unfavourable and weak for them. Just like many normal people recall feelings like\u2026 I can\u2019t remember the name for this one, but: a sensation or desire to squeeze cute small animals; pleasure/curiosity watching someone get hurt, sometimes a sadistic almost sexual pleasure in watching someone get hurt, desire to physically harm someone, etc. I mean, most humans experience some of these negative feelings and many more, but we feel so repulsed by them, so guilty, that we quickly stop feeling them. We add no \u2018significance\u2019 to them and so the feelings never mature into fully developed emotions. Well, many psychopaths, sociopaths, and even sadistic narcissists do not feel repulsed at these feelings. Some of them add significance to the feelings and so the feelings continue to be felt, and grow into a big part of the sicko\u2019s life.\nSo much in terms of feeling depends on significance added, as well as capacity. Empaths feel whole ranges of emotion which narcissists cannot even begin to imagine exist. Because we give significance to even the slightest feeling passing our minds, and also because we have a larger capacity for emotion and feeling in general.", "Thank you for the question. I am a bit confused though, the other difference in reference to? What differences have you come up with already?\nWhat I can do is say this: narcissists have a strong need for admiration, many empathic people or those with high EQ do not; narcissits have disregard for others feelings, your average person does not have total disregard; narcissists cannot handle criticisms, while more people do not enjoy criticism of their person they can handle receiving it; another difference is a narcissists need for special treatment or entitlement, while we all would love to think that we are so special and that everywhere we go and everyone we see will know that and adjust their every word and deed accordingly, we realize that is not in fact reality. We all are human beings and we all are special in so many ways but we are not entitled to more nor less than anyone else.\nI hope that helps answer your question.", "Not really.

After a year she gave birth to a boy baby . After a while, she started noticing her husband's behavior a little weird.\nHe had some anger management issue. He used to throw every thing in his hands even for small disagreements.\nMore to her bad luck , her parents and her brother died in car accident the same year. she lost her whole family on spot. They had a huge property, to which she is the only heir.\nAfter that, her husband started to torture her to transfer the property in his name . He was not at all good in his career.\nHe started from verbal abuse to physical assault . Every other day there were red finger prints on her cheeks.\nHer uncle and aunt stood by her side. They tried to convince him but all went in vain.\nShe is going through a rough phase , god knows how it will end up. That's what I know as my hubby told me.\nMaybe after a week when I met her, she was walking with little difficulty as her leg was swollen and her left hand fingers were too red in color.\nI asked what had happened. She said her husband, as usual, had flogged her with the belt , folding her hands at her back.\nHer eyes were filled with tears.\nI asked her to take him for counseling maybe that could help. She said he wouldn't come. He wouldn't even let her eat food peacefully. She was terrorized every minute of her life under the same roof.\nHe is a lawyer and knows all the pros and cons; hence, very stubborn and domineering.\nA few days later, my husband received a call from her asking if she could have any better lawyer for herself to seek divorce from the man.\nShe said her husband locked her inside home and left for office.\nThat unfortunate day he beat her up to near death and tied her legs and hands to the chair.\nAfter hours of struggling, she managed to open the window and called her neighbor. Who called her uncle and let her free by breaking the door.\nMe and My husband visited her that day. I was really scared by seeing her in that state, so severely tortured and she was crying profusely.\nHer uncle then confronted him on phone. He said he would kill her if she wouldn't transfer her property in his name and straight take his son from school in the afternoon the same day.\nHer uncle picked her son immediately from the school in half an hour.\nShe was hell frightened but anyhow lodged a complaint against him to the police.\nShe tried for eight years to save her marriage. However, she doesn't want to lose her son too.\nAfter that, they both shifted to her uncle house. The little boy of six years had seen so much of violence at this young age and he used to be very sick after seeing his father beating and shouting.\nHe didn't go to school for long as his father was a very big threat.\nOnce, we forcefully took them to mall to cheer them up. While playing, her kid called my husband dad. That time, I realized how desperately the poor little kid was longing for a father figure. \ud83d\ude14\nThe divorce case was filed and after a year it was granted.

(I do feel the weight in my chest I can only relate to that.) It made me so insecure that I wish I took no more place than one dot. Like all of my body has the urge to shrink.\nWe are together for six months today. At first I couldn\u2019t believe that finally I met someone sharing the same values in life as me. He couldn\u2019t care more. He wanted to spend all his time with me (that\u2019s when I began to lose friends because I was never there for them anymore). We were doing everything together, I started to believe that he is my family right now and we talked a lot about forming one. All sugar spice and everything nice. I felt safe and loved for the first time in my life (I have a history of eating disorders, anxiety and depression, I really struggled the most of my life). I thought it was all lastly over.\nHe got me believed that I can be what I am actually and that I can share everything with me. So I shared that once (couple of years ago), I had one night stand. He shouted at me in anger and called me a whore and that I lost all his respect. God knows how hurt I was that night. Next morning he confessed making it a too big deal and continued being super nice. We went on a vacation together only for me to spend 5 days in a hotel room proving to him that I only love him and that I am not a person who will allow itself a one night stand anymore. He was so insecure and all I was doing was loving him to the moon and back and doing everything to convince him that he\u2019s the one and the only important thing in my whole life is our precious relationship.\nEventually he convinced me to move abroad with him, because he found a better job and was sure that I, being well educated, can do the same thing very quickly. Since I failed to do so, I am being called miserable, incapable, retarded, my every move here is a mistake, I don\u2019t know how to talk to people because I am always so nice and nobody will take me for real, he just wants a normal life, not with me being a burden. He is perfectly happy even if I fail here, he will go on with his life like we never happen. So I am basically a piece of trash without a working contract. I forgot to mention that I left my safe job back home and everything I had just to be with him. 20 days here I don\u2019t deserve a nice word let alone something else. I am all alone and I fear him coming back home from work. Because I fear another fight, and feel like the next one will break me to pieces.\nAnother topic is commenting on other women, whenever a decent looking one passes by, he can\u2019t hold up. I figured out that we only watch those movies if there is one of his crush actress in.

I felt like, This was gonna be a new beginning and that girl was out of the picture for good.\nWe started dating but am having some gut about he so, I decided to do some digging on him, so I was introduce to Http://Ghostspy.Quora\n, I was able to see all the conversation with the girl he told me they broke up but the conversation reveal a lot to me, but I didn't ask him nor talk about it.\nDays into the thing we had, We went for a nice car ride to a beautiful area of the city. We were listening to music.. And the song that was playing was a song that reminded him of her. So he told me that.. he was sorry for before. And he said that. He didn't want to hurt me. But when he likes a girl. He'd like to stick to one. I ended up crying. Because I felt as if he was going to leave me for her again. But he held me.. and he told me. He was sorry and that Im different. And he was stupid for giving her another chance like that. And that cheating couldn't be tolerated.\nDays after that. He started going out late and doing drugs with his friends. Making new \"girlfriends\" throughout the night. One day.. I did something that I felt changed us. Something I deeply do regret. I sent him a text. Telling him I didn't think i can keep talking to him if he kept doing drugs. He told me he was confused.. and he had stopped talking to me ever since.\n(My ex, was also a druggie.

And a little piece of my heart would just fall apart. It hurts so much.\nId sometimes even see her with his ex girlfriend.\nCouple of days before school had started, I was taken to the hospital after blacking out and puking my guts out. I told him to come visit me but he didn't reply to me. After getting out that day I found out I was anemic.\nI'm currently sick and taking iron pills and medication because I am also very ill..

To be home with are two boys more.\nA little about us; we meet in 2009 got married in 2011 had two bright and handsome boys. Back to what happened not to long after she started her new job about 5 month in her job site lost a co worker to a car accident. She she took it hard because she had talked to the co-worker that morning right before the accident. She called me at work and told me. Just like any lovey husband would do I told her I'll be heading to pick her up. But she just told me no she going to stay at work. And come home. That night she did not come home till 12am which was out of the ordinary for her. I asked her why she was late home. She told me she and her other coworkers had to help cook for the person family Gathering.\nSo a couple of days pass the same routine leave early come back late. Every day I try to ask if she was ok I even told her I'm there to comfort her and that she has someone there for her to cry on. But every day it was the same same answer she was ok. On the day of the the funeral she ran into one of her other coworkers and finally introduce me to him saying that this was her chump. The guy was as old as us he at first did not want to shake my hand or look me it the eyes. Then when she and him hug she started to cry on his shoulders. I found that very strange and that she never mentioned that she was going to all the Gatherings with him tell he had mentioned it when we first seen him and he finally shook my hand.\nLater that day I ask her what was her relationship what the guy I just met she said he was just a friend who took it hard and she needed to cheer him up along with her other coworkers. After that I started noticing she was texting him and calling him more often at work and after work she would say it was just work-related when I asked and I kept on asking if there was something going on between them.\nFast forward two Christmas of 2016 I was told by my wife that she had to work late and that everyone had to work late too so I didn't question it. She didn't get home until 3 a.m. that morning. She slept till 11 a.m. by then I was up had breakfast cooked and the boys were fed she said it was it was very tough at work last night they had to do a lot of catching up. Life went on then till New Year's Eve she said she had to work late again and that she would be home late two. As usual I stayed home and watch the kids watch TV and cartoons with them the next day she was not home and she didn't get home until the afternoon she said she had to take a shower because she felt dirty from all the sweating and that the AC had stopped working in their building so as usual I didn't say nothing and let it be but deep down I knew she was with her male co-worker that had met only one.\nAfter that she changed are sex life died out completely. And then the end of January she called one night saying she had to work late the kids were at their grandparents house and I had run out of patience. I hired Http://Ghostspy.Quora\njust to know what she was really doing. The next day I received a file containing all her texts and emails. It turned out that she was cheating on me after all. I was heartbroken but I acted as though I was oblivious. She was texting her coworker every minute everyday and it was sexual at times. It got to a point where he even asked if her stop texting him because his wife was home. She even was sending him nude pictures. Now it was all adding up every time the company had dinner or cookouts he would avoid me every chance he got and she would avoid looking at him or talking to him while I was there. So after two more days of playing like I don't know what she up to. I called her at work and asked if she would love to have lunch with me. She hesitated at first and said that she was supposed to go have lunch with her friend but eventually said she'll have lunch with me. At lunch we talked about work. Then I final asked her about cheating with her man from work she kept denying it till I told her I'd seen every thing she texted him. And that I was going to the head person to see what he thinks. She finally broke down and told me she was seen him. That it started that night there coworker died. And that it was just supposed to be a one-time thing but it continued and that her working late was just a cover for them because he was married too. I was so disgusted by what I heard and was so mad and hated her so much that I left and went back home. She tried to call but I never wanted her calls. I just texted her telling her to stay at her mom house from the next couple of weeks.\nAfter two and a half months I finally decided that that my kids came first and that they needed their mother back home. I called her and told her that she could come home but under one condition that she could not talk see text any form of communication with her man from work. And she said she will keep her promise could not have anything to do with them. My question is did I do the right thing or should I have just and kicked her out and never let her come back?", "It\u2019s awesome, abusive relationships are GOOD and should be encouraged in America.", "Ive been in an abusive relationship. i\u2019ve never talked about it with anyone because i don\u2019t want the attention drawn towards me. I don\u2019t really have the words to explain it but to simplify it down, it basically feels like your trapped. When I was dating my ex boyfriend, he emotionally abused me most of the time. I had to lie to him all of the time just because of how insecure and controlling he was. I mainly screwed myself over because I\u2019m a person who believes in change. And I gave him so many chances to change and better himself but he never did. Not to mention, I was (and still am) grieving a loss of a friend of mine when I was still dating him. And I could never talk about it with him because he would get jealous and insecure. He would say \u201dYour not allowed to talk about other guys. I don\u2019t care if your friend died or not.\u201d It was awful. I was grieving while also being mistreated. He always made me feel bad for things I shouldn\u2019t have felt bad for. Thats not all of it but yeah. I don\u2019t feel like going into more detail", "It\u2019s like living with your enemy", "As a male who was constantly beaten by a small but athletically strong woman it was awful.

In three years is happened over a dozen times.\nI never accuser of being an Abuser of a Psychopath but if I mentioned it she would call them \"her unforgivable acts\". When we finally broke up she tried to make light of these moments.\nI should have left the first time she did it.. Instead I justified her actions because of the reasons she gave for her being unstable such as an absent father in her childhood.\nI'm sure if I hadn't made her leave - it would have happened again.

It's feeling so worthless and full of sorrow that being punched, choked, hit, kicked, and thrown around doesn't even hurt nearly as much as your need to be loved by your abuser not being filled. I escaped a 4yr abusive relationship after her threw boiling water on me and I got second degree burns over 25% of my body. (He had previously thrown cold drinks in my face saying I need to be cooked off) after I got burned I went into shock and didn't know what to do. I grabbed the bottle of vodka out of my freezer and took ibuprofen and muscle relaxers. He was still mad at me and yelling and I had to snap him it off it screaming I'm hurt really bad, you have to stop I'm really messed up I've never been in this much pain in my life. He finally helped me get in the shower and forced me to stand under the water even tho it hurt so bad. I told him I needed to go to the hospital after I googled taking care of burns and couldn't find anything online about taking care of a burn bigger than 2 inches. He talked me out of it and I told him I couldn't take the pain. He said he was going to get me something for it and brought me back heroin ( I DO NOT DO HEROIN!!!) I didn't care tho I did it, I would of done ANYTHING to take that pain away. After 2 days he finally took me. I tried to lie for him but as fast as they could they got him out of the room and told me they knew I was lying. I didn't file a police report tho. He went to the car and while he was gone they came to take me up to the burn unit ICU. I started asking about him and if they were gonna tell him where I was and that I needed him with me. When the lady wheeling me up told me it wasn't visiting hours I burst into tears. When they came in to scrub my skin off all I cared about was getting to see him. The worst part he didn't care at all. He used to be sorry when he hurt me but that had ended awhile back. Instead of caring he left me at the hospital mad at me cuz I mentioned counseling. He said I always blamed everything on him. That's the last time I was in the same room as him besides a court room for an order of protection. I went completely no contact in Feb and he still tries one way or another to get ahold of me now in June. It's sick and twisted and even tho your in it you can't see that at all.", "The most dangerous thing about being in an abusive relationship is that, so many times, it feels like love would make everything alright again.\nThat if you just stayed shut and not made so many mistakes, the pain would go away.\nThat yes, you're hurting, but all of this is your fault.

I hear his booming footsteps behind me. Oh, shit.\nBefore I can turn around he grabs my arm tightly. I hiss at him to let me go. He responds by flinging me onto the couch.\nMy adrenaline kicks in. I bounce back up and tell him to get the fuck away from me. He stands tall and advances towards me again, this time shoving me by my collarbone. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna fuck another dude, huh?

Huh?\u201d He shoves again. \u201cHuh?\u201d I try to be sturdy, but he pushes me back onto the couch.\nI jump back up again, but this time I slip past him and try to go grab my shoes in the bedroom.

He\u2019s ripped down the shower curtain. Okay. It\u2019s time for me to run.\nI eye the deadbolt on the front door. I can make it\u2026 I think. I can try. If he catches me he\u2019ll grab my keys.\nI sprint towards the door and unlock it in time. I run down three flights of stairs. Why did we have to pick the apartment on the top floor? I know I have to get to my car before him. My heart has no time to sink as I hear him running down the stairs behind me. I\u2019m outside. The door flings open behind me.\nHe\u2019s faster than me. He runs past me and opens the car door on the passenger\u2019s side. Do I run back upstairs and lock him out of the apartment? No, he\u2019ll beat down the door. The cops will be called. I weigh my options and get into the driver\u2019s seat.\n\u201cGet the fuck out,\u201d I say calmly, \u201cor I\u2019ll call my dad.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, Amy?\u201d he screams. \u201cWhy are you such a worthless fucking slut?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a slut!\u201d I scream back. \u201cGet out!\u201d\nIt was rare for me to scream back. He raises his hand and in a blur he slaps me hard on the face.\nMy ears ring. I look around. People\u2019s apartment windows were not even ten feet from my windshield. No one saw. No one could help me.\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking slut, I bet you wanted to get raped by that guy. You fucking loved it.\u201d\nI start to gasp and cry. A panic attack. This is too much. This is all too much.\n\u201cWeh!\u201d he mocks me. \u201cGo ahead and cry, you stupid bitch.\u201d\nI sink my head into the steering wheel and weep. I can\u2019t do this.\nI did it for two more years. These stories were not the only instances; rather, they\u2019re just examples from the hundreds of others and are by no means the most severe.\nAnd you know what? The instances like these were not the worst part of the relationship for me.\nThe absolute worst part wasn\u2019t the feeling of despair that set in when I was away from him for more than an hour, either. It wasn\u2019t being slowly isolated from everyone I cared about. It wasn\u2019t my questioning of my sanity when he held me gently as he could in his own way, and I felt safe. It wasn\u2019t even the exhaustion I could see in my young eyes when I looked in the mirror.\nIt was his dead refusal to acknowledge what he\u2019d done. What he is.\nThe trauma would build up. I would feel dead most of the time, but one slip of my medicine and my heart would explode. I\u2019d beg him to love me. To just hold me and tell me he cared and that it would be okay. That he would change. That I was worth it. That yes, he had raped and hit and hurt me and I wasn\u2019t crazy. That he only multiplied my traumas and that I wasn\u2019t a bitch for trying to work on this.\nBut no. Every single time, he expertly deflected and gaslighted me, and after a few times of this, I began to feel like the girl who cried wolf. All you ever talk about is your trauma, he said. So I shoved it down and tolerated the abuse so I would be less annoying. No one else would love me, after all.\nThere are few things more maddening than being met with ridicule and denial after you lay your heart out and beg your abuser to love you like they\u2019d promised. There is nothing I can ever say to him to make him understand reality, but that is something you must accept while moving on.\nAn abusive relationship is an internal battle. It can be just like mine or totally different. For most people, though, there\u2019s still the dilemma: you can\u2019t stay. You can\u2019t go. You must stay. You must go. You have to stay. You have to go. You\u2019ll die if you stay. You\u2019ll be alone if you go. Is it worse to be alone, or spend time with someone you\u2019re attached to who has no empathy for you? Is it better to be in a cave if it\u2019s all you\u2019ve ever known, or brave the sunlight and face the painful growth and simultaneous wonder the outside world will bring?\nThat is the question, and I\u2019ve found my answer.", "Dear All,\nIts not that any one is forcing me to be in this so called relationship, but I am unable to let go of this.\nI am 30 years old and I have been in relations since i was 18 I guess. I had may be 4 boy friends including the current one. I was in deep love with 2 of them including the current name, lets name him \u201cG\u201d\nIts not that I had any perfect love, relationship or someone who loved me dearly, still me being me always fell for someone who showed his care and gave some attention to me.\nEvery guy who tells me he loves me, I feel he loves me, Every guy who acts or genuinely cries for me is love towards me, I guess I am yet to understand how is a true love felt judged or accepted.\nIts going to be a little long answer as I don\u2019t have anyone in my life with whom I can share my heart with.\nSo I met G in my office some 7 years back, he was a flamboyant type of a boy who would keep multiple girls around her, take them out on dates, get physical, enjoy the moment and then move on.\nHe has been in multiple flings with his average looks and still have managed to do good with all of them.\nOur age difference is about 8 years and therefore the maturity level is different, looking life differently is obvious.\nWhen I met him for the first time I remember him guiding me my way to a cabin for my interview, he often tells me how he was awestruck by me and always wanted to protect me from everything, for him I was very vulnerable and innocent for this mean world.\nI am a very emotional person and can get attached to anyone with their kind words, he was one of them. He was never prepared to get into any relation as he did not believe in love and was already occupied by many flings. I don\u2019t know how but slowly and steadily in 3 months I had already started feeling for him, I tried to confess many times and he ignored all the time as he thought he was emotionally incapable to be with anyone in this world. But I still did not give up and tried every time.\nSlowly he was open to hear me, he use to at least listen to me if not reciprocate my emotions and sometimes he even touched me which made me feel that he is getting closer to me.\nI never understood that I can be one of his flings here, we did get physical many times, in office outside office but never had sex till date.\nHis physical needs were my mental pleasure of being able to willful his desire and I would feel like a women when he touched me. I allowed him every single time to touch me and fulfill his and kind of my desires too. This started getting serious for me as it was not only physical that I was looking for, it was even my emotions which connected him and I was in LOVE.\nHe use to ignore me completely whether it is calls, messages, BBM messages etc, I has set a different ringtone for him to not miss even single message or call from him in any given time. He use to take 3 days to 7 days to reply on calls and messages. All day in office, I will stare at him, would find reason to talk to him and he would find reasons to be away from me. It was only when his physical needs aroused, I would be called for.\nI lived this life with and without complains as I was happy for that 15 min that he gave me for his physical requirements.\nI had to go on leave for my cousin\u2019d wedding for 5 days and in that scenario I was not able to contact him at all, where may be he realized that something is missing and may be it was me, my calls, my messages, my presence around him.\nHe calls me one day and tells me what\u2019s up, were are you? you are not seen in the office since few days, I happen to tell him about the reason of leave and he acknowledged.\nI use to sit late nights in office as he would be in office and may be, be on laptop or call and I would sit till late because he would take me along and drop me home, walking or in auto and that was my world. Little things that might not have meant anything to him was my source of happiness.\nLater he started reciprocating my emotions but never said that he loves me, not that he has stopped being with other girls but he gave me some serious attention, took me out on a date would spend weekends with me and my life was filled with happiness.\nGradually this became my life, our weekends were mostly together, birthdays and festivals were together and we lived a life more or less like a husband and wife except staying at one place and sex.\nIts not that we did not try having sex, we did try but he had Erectile dysfunction (ED). I had no complains with that as well. I could easily live without sex but not without him. He was my everything. Its been 7 years with him and not even once we could perform sex and get satisfied but be it.\nHe is one of the rudest person I have ever know, he can hurt me so much that I can go in a zone where I get suicidal thoughts. His priority was work which I don\u2019t think he is good at, he is very bad at time management, people management and is very slow in life when it comes to work but who cares for me it was him and I was open to everything that he made me do.\nPlease note: He was emotionally and Physically incapable to loving me.\nOnly thing he was good at was spending money, he was a brat when it was about spending money, eating, drinking or buying stuffs for me. Not that he would buy and surprise me but I on multiple occasion would ask things and he would happily buy that for me.\nNo one on this earth has given me pain like he has and I don\u2019t think I will ever allow anyone to treat me like a shit like he has kept me.\nAbusive relation? Yes since a year I am going through verbal and physical abuse by him.\nHe is so frustrated by my presence in his life that he has started giving bad words and even hitting me on occasions where he loosed his cool.\n4\u20135 Months back I have happen to discover that he has been cheating on me since 4 years with another office colleague and had physical relations with her as well.\nShe is mentally and physically connected but he just was physically inclined towards her. My colleagues would bring up stories about her and him and all the time when I heard I would laugh over it and think how cheap can one female be and use someone\u2019s name for the heck of showing herself in love. I would also go and tell the same stories to him and he would ask me to ignore all and not to react on any.\nEven after me telling him all these stories he did not stop, and continued to physically involved with her till I came to a site one day of she talking to him and I catching hold of him red handed in the office.\nI am a very insecure person and cant share him with anyone, I have never trusted a man because of my past experience and never wanted to trust him also, we had fought quite a lot on my insecurities and he would scream shout ignore block stop answering calls and messages etc till I would beg and be sorry of my deeds.\nI feel choked and feel suicidal when he treats me like this, he threatens to stop talking to me and that feeling itself is a death to me. He knows my weakness is him and my world revolves around him, I have no one apart from him in this world who I love not even my parents. I have made him GOD of my life and has let him write my destiny.\nComing back to I caught him red handed talking to the girl from my office, he strictly said no, it was not her and I can do whatever I want and he will not show his phone. I had lost my world, my ground and my heart sank in pain and burn of being cheated and wanted to cry out loud there itself.\nOur relationship was closed one, no one except me and him have known about us and he was very very alert on no one should know about me and him.\nAs I lost it and panicked at that time and he saw I was not in control and ofcourse what came to his mind was his image in office and what will others think if I create a scene.\nHe was not ready to speak and I followed him to his seat and forced him to show his phone which he was not willing to, I had lost my grounds and I picked a Head ache pain reliever lotion bottle lying on the other desk and started drinking. I cant express how I felt, I could not breathe and he got scared and stopped me from doing this because of course he was worried about his image and what if i m hospitalized or die, he will be responsible for it. He later got convinced to speak to me on this and we went inside the cabin to talk on this.\nHe accepted he was cheating on me with her, they were physically involved, that female use to sit late waiting for everyone to leave from office and then both would go home together and get physical in office.\nI who was with him since 7 years was deprived from getting physical satisfaction due to his incapability of fucking me, I who did not get any emotional satisfaction as well as he never made me feel secured with him about my position in his life, I never got anything when i was capable of giving everything that a man would require.\nI m decent looking, though heavy, capable to love with all my heart and capabilities and also satisfy physical needs of a man, but still I had to go through this leaving unsatisfied. My world broke into pieces and I started figuring out on what did I do wrong that he had to go to someone else???\nHe apologized he cried and he showed me that he was sorry for whatever happened and wont repeat again. We cried, I hit myself badly, I dropped him to station, he said he needs one more chance and he wont repeat again and I should not leave him but at that time I was very clear about I cant be in such relation at all where I wasn't enough for a man who was not actually enough for me and we went to our respective homes crying.\nNext morning I was emotionally drained and could not get up from bed thinking life is not the same anymore and how would I now survive without him. I started getting choked again, there was fire in the body and I anyhow wanted to speak to him and forgive him for what he did, and I did that I called him as soon as I woke and told him I M READY TO FORGIVE YOU, please don\u2019t leave me. I beg him next day to be there for me as I can\u2019t be by myself without him.\nHe agreed and we continued for the day, I was very restless for the whole day, thinking about how I was fooled, why did he touch her when I was always available rather I should have had gone to someone for physical needs but I choose to be loyal and did even think of loosing. I could imagine him touching her everywhere like he did to me and I was literally burning on my seat.\nThat female was in front of my eyes and I was unable to bare and was feeling as if my life ended.\nI begged him to meet me same evening and we happen to go out on auto ride, I could not bare and I asked him again on why did he do this to me, I asked him stuffs in details and then he opened about having phone sex, sex chats at night.\nShe has touched his parts and he has touched her parts as well. I was numb and did not know what to do, I asked him to show his chats, he had very conviniently deleted them and was not ready to show any of them, Later again I had a headache liquid which I started drinking again to which he agreed to show me his phone. There again I happen to see another new love story of his, 2nd female who he was secretly dating since 1 year.\nWhatsapp chat was filled with love, hugs, kisses emojis. Miss you, love you and what not.\nI just wanted to die, I lost my cool and started hitting him on why did he do this? What was not enough in me? I was never shared a soft emotions, kisses hugs and miss is no where in my thought as well\u2026.\nI somehow gathered courage to get up again and give this a fresh start as I cant live without him. He was sorry may be for fortnight and later was same with his behavior. I m a very very Emotional person, I use to sit and cry anywhere and anytime, remembering what he did to me and he would get furious about my behavior and not letting him forget what happened. How could I help him, when I needed help!!!\nI cant even express how I spent those days or rather still spend these days thinking about it.\nHe was never concerned about how I felt what would I go through and do I even deserve being in this situation?\nBut its me who does not want to leave him, I m stuck to him, I cannot digest the fact or see myself ever without him.\nSHOPPING, MOVIES, COFFEES everything happens with him, he is closest to me whom I share my family problems, personal problems everything with and I m unable to let go of him. I also fear if he will go back to my office colleague or go back to her flings and because he should not go anywhere I go through all his torture, his abuses related to me my work and my family as well.\nSince 2 months, he has started giving me all sort of bad words including \u2018BC, MC, R,C\u201d and many more, He has started physically hitting me and hurting me badly for it be numb for weeks. He has understood my weakness and he has also understood that no matter what he does I wont leave him and may be that is the reason he behaves the way he wants to.\nI am not less then a slave to him, I walk talk behave speak smile do everything as per him and the only thing I am unable to control is my insecurities for him. I live in this fear that he will any day come up to me and tell me that he is dating someone else and I should walk out from his life. I dont want to see this day ever.\nI also pray that one day he realizes my emotions, my feelings, love for him and some day consider me to be respected\nI understand everything but I am unable to act, If he says dont call me and I still call he blocks me, switches off his phone or does not answer even if I call him 100 times. He would watch me calling but never sympathize on me and answer\nFinally now I have realized that I am in an abusive relationship, Physical and emotional, No one loves me, he does not love me, will some one ever love me, will I be able to move on from him, will I be stuck like this, I am 30, what is my future? When will some one actually understand me ?\nI really wish that one day he realizes my worth and comes back to me. If you are reading, please understand I really love you, I am not getting married to anyone coz I dont think I can justify my love for anyone like I do it for you. Please understand cycle of KARMA, its not really worth going through and it is really very painful too.\nPlease let me not pray for you being in the same position to realize my worth, as it would be too late and life is very short to live happily.\nI love you and will love you forever, just be there even if you can\u2019t reciprocate, DONT LEAVE ME, DONT CHEAT ON ME, I DONT DESERVE IT.

It was my crazy ex-boyfriend who I\u2019d met the previous day at a common friend\u2019s wedding after not seeing each other for 4 months or so. I quickly put it on silent as my heart started beating really fast. I kept receiving texts that said I should speak to him just once. I ignored, obviously.\nI\u2019D BEEN IN THIS RUT FOR MORE THAN 3 YEARS AND I KNEW IT WAS A TRAP.\nAfter this, I put my phone on silent and tried to sleep. The next thing I heard was my doorbell ringing. At 7am. My cook didi (the maid) doesn\u2019t come till 11am, then who could this be? I knew it was him. My heart was beating faster now. I\u2019m thinking, \u2018He is within 10 meters, and all that stands between both of us is a door.\u2019 The door was locked. Then what was I scared of? I was scared of him breaking and entering.

I lost weight couldn\u2019t look people in the eyes, was so jumpy and on edge, unhappy and sometimes driving to work I used to think of ending it all by putting my foot down and going over the edge . I felt so lost and went into my own little fantasy world. I was walking on eggshells . I hated my life and I hated him. I often felt so alone and cut off from reality. I was numb and for some time lost all my energy to get out of this toxic sick relationship. I was slowly dying inside and each day I stayed I lost a little more of myself. I was lucky though I had good family and an amazing friend who through all the shit stood by me waiting for me to free myself . The one person who truly had my back. It took too long but eventually enough was enough and I could take no more of the abuse. I left with hardly anything while he was at work. Then the hard work really began on the long road to recovery.", "What is it like to be in an abusive relationhsip? It\u2019s like losing your mind, and having no idea why. It\u2019s having the illusion, but not the reality of freedom. It\u2019s crumbling self-esteem. It\u2019s blaming yourself for everything wrong in your life. It\u2019s a slow spiral that only escalates, but often so slowly you don\u2019t notice it until it\u2019s too late.\nIf you think you might be in an abusive relationship, but aren\u2019t sure, or don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad enough to leave, or if you\u2019re recovering from the effects of having been in an abusive relationship, I urge you to check out this resource: Why Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men\n, by Lundy Bancroft. If you can\u2019t afford the book, or need it immediately, a quick google search will easily bring up a pirated .pdf of the book.\nLundy Bancroft has made his career working with male perpetrators of domestic violence. The book was absolutely instrumental in helping my mother and I in:\nunderstanding that much of what my father did, even without the physical violence, rose to the level of abuse\nfully internalizing the idea that the abuse was not our fault. It seems like a simple idea, but when you\u2019re in it, or have experienced it, your worldview changes and you lose trust in your own instincts. Figuring out how to believe that it wasn\u2019t my fault was a huge step in healing\nThe book is a fantastic breakdown of different types of abuse, different types of abusers, and common myths about why/how men become abusers.

It would have saved me years of self-blame.", "People often say:\nTime heals everything.\nYes, I truely, believe it does. But what about the scars? No matter how hard you try, every wound will leave a scar.\nAn abusive relationship leaves you scarred for life. It makes you exhausted and long to end the relationship sooner than you can. However, you realise you love the person too. That is the biggest dilemma you can be in. You know that the relationship is shattering you deep inside, breaking every possible part of you bit by bit. And on the other hand, you know that you love your partner. Being with him will pain you as much as quitting the relationship will. So, you decide to endure the pain.\nYou remain in a constant fear of what might be imminent and every disagreement or argument makes you ponder about what might be impending. You withdraw yourself into your own shell and estrange yourself from every person possible. You get detached from all the things which once used to give you pleasure. Nothing seem to please you anymore and your mind revolves around that one thing almost at every hour of the day.\nYou find yourself with low self-esteem and a lot of self doubt. You keep wondering if you aren't good enough or if all the other relationship are just like yours. It gets really hard pretending before people about how generous, caring and understanding your partner is, while in reality he is just the opposite. You start losing your faith in love and relationships and end up just accepting whatever your partner offers.\nYou begin cursing yourself for not doing anything about the pain inflicted upon you. And once you feel this, that is the end. You realise you no longer can keep up with this torture anymore. At a point, you just want the relationship to end. I did.\nAll you need to do then is end the relationship. No person in the world has the right to hurt you, physically or emotionally. Yes, it is really an awful feeling to leave behind someone you were in love with. But it is vital to realise that your happiness is the most important goal of your life. And if a person loves you enough, he will realise its value too. You may detest yourself for months and years, but life is indeed beautiful.\nYou never know. You may find someone who accepts you with all the scars you have. But prior to that you should always remember:\nIn order to love someone, you need to love yourself first.\nYou are always your first priority. So is your happiness.", "I\u2019m saying this from experience (and this does not represent everyone because abuse is different for everyone), but here are some things that happened to me when I was in an abusive relationship with my parents:\nI was constantly hurt, either physically or emotionally. I would often suffer cuts and bruises from my mother and my dad would just sit there and watch. It takes a toll on your confidence, and I would often lie to my friends at school on how I got those visible marks.\nI developed mental illnesses like depression and anxiety. I had low self-esteem and it still, to this day, has an effect on me. I didn't want to go out a lot, even if the only few friends I had invited me to someplace. I never felt good enough for anyone, and going outside just fueled that even more.\nIt still haunts me. Unfortunately, I was too shy and afraid to get help from counselors, so I had to grow up in that abusive household. Some people don\u2019t believe that I had to go through abuse because I didn\u2019t look like someone who\u2019d gone through it. This was also the case during my childhood; one of the few friends I confided my situation to told me to \u201ccalm down\u201d when I told her I did not love my parents because of their abuse.\nRelating back to the last point, I don\u2019t love my parents. I know that in society, parents \u201clove\u201d you and do the best for you, but I didn\u2019t feel like my own parents did. If \u201clove\u201d to my parents was hitting and berating me for no reason, then maybe they did \u201clove\u201d me in that sense. But writing this answer years later, I do not think they loved me in the caring sense- the view that society upholds as true love. I don\u2019t love them, and I\u2019ve healed enough to say that I don\u2019t care what society says anymore.\nI know all my other points were negative, but I honestly did heal a bit from the abuse. Frankly speaking, I still have my days where I don\u2019t feel the best, and those days can be the worst since I still have depression. But I\u2019m still healing, and hopefully I\u2019ll get to the point where I learn to let go and love myself someday.\nThat said, I don\u2019t want anyone to face abuse at all. Whether it is sexual, physical, or emotional, abuse is a demoralizing, evil act of manipulation done in order to make the victim feel as if they are the ones acting \u201ccrazy.\u201d Victims are NOT crazy at all, and I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to go through it. ever.\nPlease get help if your\u2019e going through abuse. Please. I know its hypocritical of me to say that when I myself did not get help, but I really don\u2019t want you or anyone else to be in any harmful situation. Abuse is abuse.

It's a slow and painful thing, the abused person loses insight on who they are, what their dreams and goals are. I lost so much and have been a new work in progress for years. Some days are easier, in reality sometimes it's hard to believe who I was prior to that relationship. I lost a lot, I hurt the only people who truly cared about me. In the end you just have to stand up and admit it was a mistake and forgive yourself for any mistakes you may have made. Remember those were not intentional, I feel like the devil (my exhusband) took everything he could from me. It's been 10 years since I finally left, and I still have days that I feel his eerie and negative energy around me. I continue to remind myself it's gone the past, and I have made a positive lesson from the experience. If you are still with the person who's abusing you, GET OUT NOW. The sooner you walk away the sooner and faster you can heal. I've lost almost 18 years because I stayed out of fear, 10 of them are working on healing, forgiving myself for all the fuck ups I made during the 8 years I wasted with him.

Abuser starts abusing their partner because of they are insecure about social values. And they makes an effort to gain or re-gain those values through domination and control.\nAre you the abuser one or victim one, maybe you yourself don\u2019t know, in the video, here are the few signs decide yourself.", "Hello,\nWhile we cannot say what it is like to be in an abusive relationship, but our blogger ED Times lays down exactly what will happen if you choose to stay in one:\n10 Effects Of Choosing To Stay In An Abusive Relationship\nLove might be one of the most beautiful feelings in the world. What makes it beautiful is the communion of two people, two souls, and two thoughts. Relationships need to be maintained with utmost care, love, and understanding\u2026 Especially when accompanied by reciprocation and concerns.\nA lot of people fall in love and rejoice, a few regret. Some of those who regret fall out of it. They get out of the terrible mess, sooner or later. They realize self- love is more important than validation from the \u201cbetter half\u201d.\nStill, there are a few people who don\u2019t choose to move out of it, in spite of the constant pain and self- deterioration.\nThough, they make an informed choice to stay in an abusive relationship with a lover turned devil, with promises reduced to ashes and love faded and erased from the mind, yet these choices aren\u2019t rational and have a devastating effect on person\u2019s mind and health.\nLet\u2019s get to know how:\nLowering of self-esteem: Abusive relationships lower the self-esteem of the victim. The abuse needn\u2019t be necessarily in terms of physical harm but it can be emotional and mental harm too. If your partner goes ahead to underestimate your choices, beliefs and doesn\u2019t respect your opinion, then it makes you feel worthless.\nThe normal human mind can\u2019t take criticism for long and if this continues to happen over a period of time then the mind stops framing thoughts of it thinking, whatever you might be thinking isn\u2019t right and it stops being as constructive as it should.\nLess communication from outside world: The victim chooses to limit his/ her contacts from the outside world, simply because they don\u2019t the world to pass a moral judgment on their condition and do moral policing.\nThe victim feels that the situation is their own and in order to avoid questions or reprimands, they cut off their contacts with the outside world.\nLoss of social skills: Due to limited contact and lowering of self-esteem, the victim begins to fall short on their social skills, which affects their social and mental growth. They begin to grow shadily introverted which hampers life- skills and social interaction. This leads to the victim growing aloof from people and not being able to interact or share things with people openly.\nDistrust in People: Being in an abusive relationship causes the victim to start misunderstanding and mistrusting people when they express their concern towards them.\nThey start to feel that their well- wishers don\u2019t respect their choice and hence, begin to form a cocoon around themselves thinking that these people are enemies of their \u201clove\u201d.\nStockholm Syndrome: This is the most devastating and dangerous effects of abuse. In this, the victim not only becomes bonded to the abuser but also overly identifies with the abuser to stop the abuse.\nThe victim also starts to defend the abuser and their emotionally abusive actions.\nDepression: The inability of the victim to be able to sort out the situations and have a \u201chappy ending\u201d causes them to feel pity about themselves.\nScientifically, this secretes negative hormones and triggers the depression causing nerves. The constant feel-bad enforces the victim to be a prey to their brain and therefore, depression.\nSuicidal ideation or attempts: Sometimes, the pain is so grave, both physically and psychologically that the victim identifies one way to end all of this- death. Since they are so deeply involved with the abuser that they can\u2019t think of harming them.\nTherefore, the thoughts of suicide easily form a home in the victim\u2019s conscious and subconscious mind and hence, the victim engages in self- harm and may even commit suicide.\nPhysical pain without any cause: Prolonged sadness and feeling of being trapped cause the victim to have constant pangs of pain without any specific reason.\nThis happens because brain sends the signal to the victim\u2019s body about their unsatisfactory mental condition. Thus, the body reacts in response to that.\nFeeling of Denial: People go into a stage of denial- both about the circumstances surrounding their abuse and effects of the abuse on their self-esteem, health, and psychology.\nIn most cases, when abuse isn\u2019t physical- the victims go into denial of the nature of their abuser (as if the abuse never happened!)\nPhysical Damage: Abusive relationships also possess physical damage- essentially if the nature of abuse is physical. Such damage can cause lifelong injuries, disabilities, and even death.\nPeople raise your voice. Don\u2019t stay in an abusive relationship just because \u2018it was meant to be\u2019. Don\u2019t let yourself be treated, the way you shouldn\u2019t be.\nGather your voice and shout, break free and stand out alone!\n*This article was originally published on Economy Decoded*", "I will narrow the scope down to my experience with physical, emotional and neglect as a child. It was like walking on eggshells when my parent were around. When I did something on accident (i.e. drop groceries), I would curl up in a defensive ball to protect myself from abuse. I counted a month to see how many days in a row I was hit, slapped at, kicked and there was no day with out. I tried telling teachers and the school counselor. I hoped maybe I could go to mental hospital and planned to make myself sick so I might be admitted to a mental hospital or kids home and get away from my abusers. If I was forced to choose to go through my childhood again or had to choose jail, I would choose jail.", "Basically, you don\u2019t notice how bad it gets until you look back.\nYou make excuses for the person, denying their actions or passing it off as a side effect of something out of their control.\nSome characteristics of an abusive relationship:\nManipulation (this can include threats, lowering your self-worth, etc.)\nBlaming their self-harm, mental illness, or actions on you\nCycles (this can take many forms, but a common one is normal -> angry -> apologetic and back again)\nControlling, financially, physically, or emotionally\nIsolation (convincing you that they\u2019re the only person you need, that no one else likes you\u2026)\nSo it\u2019s awful. I was lucky, I had the resources to look back on our past conversations and realize how truly vicious they were.\nThis sums it up pretty well.", "I am sure the answers before mine told pretty much everything there was to be told about abusive relationships, so I am writing this one more to break free from what happened than to give valuable informations.\nMy dad is a narcissistic bipolar who abused me verbally and phisically all my life. On one episode when I was still a kid, I was learning piano, and he would attend the lesson to make sure I was doing good. Unfortunately I had very poor skills and failed to play the song the teacher requested me. He asked me to get out of the class, then to take off my glasses because he didn't want to break them, then proceeded to beat me as a punishment for failing. After this I came back to the class with a swollen face and low spirit. I was not good at socializing and had no friends for most of my childhood and teenager years, and I supposed it was because I was a failure, ugly and undesirable. In short, worthless.\nMy experiences with men were all disappointing at best, no real relationship. My first sexual intercourse with a man was a rape and obviously this affected me. I was waiting for a man who would be special and good for me and would make me forget all of this.\nThen I went abroad and I met someone who was charming, kind, clever and extremely handsome. He was very complimentary and wanted to spend all his time with me, even...too much. I ignored some of his strange behaviours, like extreme jealousy, because I liked him; I wanted him to be the \"good\" man I was looking for. Also I didn't see why such a good looking person would waste his time with an ugly mess like me. I believed myself to be lucky to have found him.\nThings quickly turned when he cheated on me. After treating me horribly he sent me flowers to ask for forgiveness and said he would do anything to gain back my trust. He apologized in tears: in short, I took him back. He was draining my energies, accusing me of things I didn't do, lying to me, but still I was craving the relationship. It was constant drama, no stability whatsoever. When I would break up with him he would try in every way to win me back and eventually succeed. He started telling me how much he would love me, at the same time constantly trying to manipulate and control me. When I told him I kissed another guy he shouted in my face I was a slut, a sex addict, a fucked up person. He told me he thought I had \"changed\" (I guess he meant 'stopped being a whore') and that all my life and experiences were fucked up. And I was like yes, I know, I am fucked up, how could I deny that? I should have felt lucky if he still would have wanted to be with someone as fucked up as me.\nOnce I blocked him on my whatsapp because he was obvessively insisting on accusing me to be flirting with a guy I did not fancy at all at a party. Five days later I met him and he told me that during these five days he was dying, that he had suicidal thoughts, and that he also spent this time trying to learn my language. He would always try to make me feel sorry for him, either begging me in tears to let him sleep at mine one last time, or telling me he did not eat properly because of my decision to keep the distance.\nHe seemed unable to feel real empathy and was not respectful of my boundaries. Several times he would touch me even after I told him I didn't want to be touched and he gave his promise to be respectful (guess I was not more than a sex tool for him). Once I woke up to him grabbing my breast after telling him not to do anything like that.\nBetween us it ended up badly because he didn't want to accept I was leaving for good, and even turned out scary and violent when he showed his true colours. One of the last things he told me is that he didn't give a shit if I was raped, confirming something I always thought. After our break up he tried to convince people we both know that I was crazy using the fact that that I told him I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.\n\"We could have had a great life together.\" One of his last texts.\nI am no longer waiting for a \"good\" man. There won't be a savior who's gonna make me think \"fuck the rest\". I don't trust anyone anymore, just need to heal.", "I am not an expert in this field, but as in my case (gay relationship), I have been in such abusive relationship, my boyfriend was very kind loving and charming at the start of relationship, just after 6 months, he changed dramatically. He started to check my mobile phones and laptop just by saying, \"you don't need your cell phone in bed or in washroom\", \"I trust you, but I don't trust the people, I don't want to lose you, etc etc\"\"\"\"....this was the psychological abuse. I beared that easily by co operating with him. But I was not allowed to have secret passwords and email accounts, I was allowed to see any one without my boyfriend's permission, I was not allowed to spent any money on my own. The verbal abuse started when our little friendly chats started to gain heat and used to conclude by proving me wrong, stupid, naive, childish, idiot, careless etc etc.\nI started to feel depressed, alone, scared. I Had to make excuses after the fight every time, he was always right. He was in control of our sex life too. The verbal abuse soon turned to physical. He.was always sorry after the abuse and used to say , \" if you haven't pushed me that far I wouldn't have touched you even, you pushed my buttons so hard etc etc\". I left my boyfriend after facing all the types of abuse for almost one year. This abusive relationship affected me mentally and financially. I had issues with my thinking capabilities, and ability to reason and think clearly. I started to have short term and long term memory losses, but thanks to God, I got treatment and now I am quite better.\nCutting long story short, no matter gay or straight, abusive relationship is an abusive relationship. Abuse does not have any reason, it cannot be treated unless or until the abuser wants to be treated. Abuser blame their victim for abuse, abusive relationship can induce depression in victims and low self esteem.\nTrust yourself and love your self more than any one whom you love", "Hell. Worse than Hell. I suffered through 4 and 1/2 years of an abusive husband while struggling with depression. I married him knowing that he would kill me one day. I was suicidal. I didn't care. He told me (often) to do the world a favor and kill myself already. The verbal, psychological (mental/emotional) and physical abuse was a constant. He would have people spy on me and report back to him...where I went for lunch, who I had a cigg break with at work...things he couldn't possibly have known otherwise. I was criticized incessantly. If I wore makeup, it was because I was cheating on him. If I spoke with someone, I waas automatically interested in sleeping with them, according to him. If I was 15 minutes late getting home from work I was beaten to the ground. I \"walked on eggshells\" constantly. Everything I said or did was wrong, somehow. He would beat me up anytime, anywhere. It didn't matter who was around. He lied to everyone constantly, did drugs behind my back, cheated incessantly. I had no idea. I was never allowed to look at my husband's telephone, or through his wallet. I later found out that he is actually a psychopath: he has 18 of the 20 defining characteristics of sociopathy. He is a pathological liar, acoholic and narcisist. He shattered my left eye socket, broke two of my ribs, dislocated my jaw. One day he decked me in the side of the head while we were in the hospital. He was being seen for being jumped/gang assaulted. I later found out that his (secret) girlfriend's boyfriend kicked his ass that night. The police were frequent visitors to our apartment. I had two orders of protection against him, restraining him from violence against me. He actually convinced me to DROP one of them, \"to work on our marriage.\" Please don't ever drop a restraining order against an abuser. I am still afraid of him, although he disappeared from our marriage in 2011. I have heard that he is still in the area, and I fear for my life, although rationally I know that he is probably beating up some new girl by now. I have agoraphobia because of the abuse. I fear leaving the house because I may run in to him randomly somewhere. I cannot get a divorce because he walked out, and never returned. I loved him, and it was the worst experience of my life. Thank god HE left ME, because it is incredibly dangerous to leave an abusive relationship. Often, professional help (social workers/police/crime victims assistance centers) need to be involved in the process of getting away from an abuser to prevent the death of the victim. Get out as quickly and as safely as you can.", "Its really bad. When I was 9, I had this friend called Shourya whose dad used to beat up his mom. I remember once when I had gone to Shourya's house for the weekend and we both decided to go for a movie one evening. Exams were just round the corner, so his mother said no. His dad however, gave us 500 rupees and said- go have fun. When we returned, his mom had a big bruise on her cheek and on asking her how she got it, she said that she fell. Later at night, I could hear someone crying and some 'thud' kinda sounds. Shourya couldn't bear it so he put on his headphones and slept, and I was too scared to go and investigate what was happening. I never went to Shourya's house again, and a year later, he moved to Mumbai.\n\nI met him again a couple of months ago( we're both 18 now) and we started talking again and got really close. He asked me out on a date and I said yes. Things were going pretty well until last week when he twisted my arm because I wouldn't kiss him. He really scares me sometimes, but I don't know why but I just cannot stay without him. He's got this magnetic personality. He doesn't beat me up or anything, but does stuff like pulling my hair, twisting my arm, and he's got this weird obsession with hot wax. He literally pours it on my knee sometimes. But he's never really hurt me.We have never ever talked about the domestic violence occurring in his house, and I'm scared he's going the same way as his dad. I just hope stuff works out for us.

Reading was one of my passions. He considered it to be a waste of time. He was so controlling that if he caught me even standing in front of books section in a store, he would pull me away. He constantly criticized me and the way I worked.

He criticized my family and never took their calls when they called to wish him for birthdays etc. The list is endless.\nI was very scared of his temper. I could never guess my what action or word would trigger his abuses. He hit me twice.

He would take care of me, see that I was eating properly and be the epitome of love.\nLeaving him never crossed my mind. For me, marriages were for forever and I did love him deeply. However, it all changed when he abused me in front of his parents, made false allegations and even questioned my character. It all ended that very moment.

And then I met my husband when I was 20. We were in love, and life seemed so perfect.\n\nI got pregnant at 22. We were not married then. And coming from a typical middle class Indian society, my options were limited. I had a miscarriage before I could figure it out.

He always managed to convince me that the fight is not as bad as i imagine it to be, and after every episode, he would be overly apologetic for his behaviour. Extremely erratic behaviour. Fights would start with me sleeping for 5 minutes extra, or taking 2 mins more in the shower, or taking a bit more time to finish my breakfast in the morning, or not wanting to watch the same TV show as him. Things as lame as this would result in verbal abuse for close to an hour.\nI cried, i got strong, i read, and realised that this is NOT normal behaviour. This is typical abusive behaviour.

Ever.Again..!\nEdit: After reading a lot of the entries here, I think my situation was fairly better but please bear in mind I was a naive, shy and awkward girl from a fairly liberal South Indian family who had lost her father and had no brothers or uncles I was very close to.And the abuser is the only guy(hopefully till I meet 'the one') I have ever been this close to and the relationship had made me extremely wary of men and relationships!\n\nI was in a long-distance relationship with this schoolmate of mine while we were in college for 2 years(We got together only during the end of high school). And I must say that we come from a small town in South India and he was a very narrow-minded person to say the least and I was the kinda person who is shy at first but after I get to know a place and someone better I can be very talkative and fun to be with. , And as fate would have it I went to study in a better college, in a bigger city than he did meaning I had much better exposure and opportunity of coming out of the shell I had been in my life all along.\n\nAt the start , everything was fine. We were like every other couple (or so I thought), messaging frequently, calling each other as soon as we got from college etc. But everything started to strain when I had made some friends and started to mingle with everyone. I must add here that my mingling wasn\u2019t even that much extreme. But he started having problems with each and everything I did, He mocked at me whenever I said I had went out with my friends(no boys) and used to ask \u2018Did u go to college to study or roam around\u2019. During my lab classes , since We had to sit in alphabetical order I was beside a guy. And he used to ask me some doubts related to classes only since he was a very studious one. One day when I had casually told this after college, my boyfriend started asking me whenever I had lab classes(Tuesdays and Fridays I think) \u2018What did he talk to you about today?\u2019\u2019, \u2018Oh! Its Friday rite?? You must have had lab classes .What did he ask you this time? \u2019.He even called me 'names' when I had JOKINGLY told him I\u2019d leave him after he gave me some kinda weird hypothetical situation. When I had told him that I said it in jest and was deeply hurt cos of this, he just said 'I don\u2019t think I said anything wrongly and I wont apologize for it too'. I absolutely hate hate hate when some guys generalize girls but he used to do the exact same thing saying \u2019All the girls are like this\u2019(I am in fact cringing when I type this) even after I said 'I hate when I hear a guy say this so most of all, you shouldn\u2019t be saying it'. But that didn\u2019t stop him one bit, since he did it till the very end of our relationship.\n\nAll the while when he used to have drinks weekly and go to sports practice like three times a week when I wasn\u2019t supposed to call him or expect to have long conversations with him whereas when I went out with my friends he would call me every half hour or so to ask me where I was, when I would be back etc.(Most of you would think this is lame but the way he used to judge and be downright nasty if I didn\u2019t attend his calls or if I didn\u2019t talk properly when he was free was too cruel!). During our second year, He befriended one of his juniors and one of my friends who went to college with him told me there were rumors surrounding him and the girl. I didn\u2019t make a big deal outta this because he had told me about this girl and I knew they were just good friends and I needn\u2019t worry. But when I casually asked him if he would stop talking to this girl if I asked him to, he just thought for some time and said \u2018No\u2019 in a very sarcastic and condescending manner which left me aghast!\n\nAnd on the day of break-up he started with \u2018Please don\u2019t leave me ,I love you blah blah blah\u2019 and even told that he would meet my mother and not let me marry anyone else for which I told him even if my mom agrees to our wedding I wouldn\u2019t and my mom wouldn\u2019t force me if I wasn\u2019t interested. But when I asked him what would he do if I decided to marry someone else rather than stay single the rest of my life like I had mentioned at the start,(At that point of time, I thought it was the only solution to all of it) he replied \u2018I wouldn\u2019t worry since you are just a second hand vehicle after all!\u2019 since we had made out and even used to have phone s** when we were in the relationship together. Little did he realize that the mere fact that I had been physical with him meant that I had really wanted to spend the rest of my life with him only to be left hurt and utterly\ndisgusted at myself!\nThere were much more things that left me hurt in this relationship but the worst part of it all was that I realized I had been with a verbally abusive boyfriend for 2 years ,only a year after breaking up. I remember feeling so guilty and be unforgiving of myself during that particular year thinking I was the wrong one since I had been the one who had initiated the break-up and feeling a pang of guilt whenever I heard dialogues about the girl breaking the guy\u2019s heart in all the movies I watched(The heroes, villains, comedians, supporting artists and everyone mouths these kind of dialogues in 99% of mainstream movies in India).\n\nLooking back, I realize that we were simply incompatible and were doomed to breakup sooner or later.Now I am working in a MNC which actually expects its employees to have great communication skills and be able to strike up a conversation with anyone and I shudder to think how my ex would react if we were still together! I have stayed single from then on and still haven\u2019t been able to see myself falling in love ever again mainly because every time I think there will be someone who will accept me for who I am, all I can think about is how easy and heartbreaking it was to get hurt.\n\nBut there were also a lot of things that I had learnt about relationships, difference between boys and men and most of all myself, what were the deal-breakers for me(male chauvinism) and that I should never ever try to change my better half\u2019s entire personality and should actually accept him for the person he is.\nSo all in all an abusive relationship will make you so self-critical of yourself at the start but at the end of the day will be both the greatest and the worst life lesson you will ever learn.", "well it just shows the upbringing of the partner who abuses you..there could me n number of reasons of him to justify his abuses but i hope there must have been just one single reason not to abuse..the reason must be LOVE. i am using 'him\nbecause i am a girl..having the verbal abuse from my partner. he used to be angry..so i forgave him many times. but i did mistake by forgiving him so many times. even some times he says that i did something so he abused me..and i am responsible for the verbal abuse done by him. i am trying to get over of that relationship in that way which it used to be in past.", "It doesn't just destroy you physically but mentally and emotionally.

Its like Hotel California - You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave! I've been in one for 4 years. And I've tried to leave once but came back because she threatened to kill herself. I married her with open eyes knowing the fact that I was entering to an abusive relationship because I felt I owed it to her and I had to take care of her and help her fulfill he life's ambitions.\nHowever, somewhere along the way I lost myself. Today I don't recognise the automaton I've become. I can't come to terms with the fact that I suffer each day of my life, I can't work most times, I'm distracted, I'm depressed and I hurt and I still take care of her. I've become detached from her. I'm cold at home. These days I don't sleep more than an hour or two for days together. And then fall ill.\nI can't express myself in front of her. In front of her, I'm usually fake; I pretend to be nice and that all's okay. But inside I'm hurting. She can usually say the worst of things in a stride. It could be about me, my work, what I care for, my parents. Give her anything to do with me and she would be able to find something to ridicule, to laugh at or to belittle. And it takes all the strength to not blow up, to not react in front of her, to not argue. But inevitably - I get down to defending myself. Always - from a position of weakness.\nIts difficult to live without freedom. Its difficult to live without being yourself all the time. Its difficult to just drift along life. It hurts to waste my life away when I know I am a gifted person. There are times I get out of home early and then don't know where to go. I want to sleep, but can't sleep in office. I want to listen to music. Or rest. Or play my guitar. Or read. Or <whatever>. But there's no place I can do it. Not at home. Not at office. Maybe if I could get down to renting a hotel. But that's very costly for just a few hours during the daytime when I'm supposed to be in office.\nSometimes taking my life seems to be the only way out. But its not an easy choice. And I don't want to cause anguish to my parents and others who care for me so much.\nActually music and movies are my only solace these days - a sort of a parallel universe. Otherwise, my life is an episode of daily verbal, emotional and sometimes, physical abuse. Which I allow and tolerate. Being in such a relationship makes you loose your self-respect and confidence. I can't look into anyone's eyes and hold my own. I used to be a public speaker and now I don't feel like facing a room full of people because I feel they can see it in my eyes that I am an abused soul.\nBut mostly - I feel ashamed of myself. And of what I allow her to do to me.\nI can't make plans. I can't decide. I check with her on everything. Or I just don't decide and opportunities pass me by. Its awful and I feel so sorry for myself. I miss intimacy in my life. I miss being myself with at least one person. I miss leaving my guard down and not thinking so much and just being spontaneous. I miss feeling good about myself. I miss thinking about myself with confidence and without her perspective.\nThe relationship is isolating - I can't talk about this to anyone.

We were in a relationship for 3 years.\nAbout the abuse: Psychological manipulation and sexual abuse. She also used physical force to restrain me, but never hit me. She is much bigger and stronger than me.\nWhat it was like:\nFor most of the relationship, I was not aware that I was being abused. I had underlying psychological problems that made me susceptible to abuse (low self esteem, loneliness, engaged in occasional casual sex and recreational drug use). It felt comforting to have someone who treated me the way I thought I should be treated.\nAt the same time, my anxiety problem, which had been nearly in remission at the beginning of the relationship, gradually worsened. By the end of the relationship, I was beyond panic attacks - I dissociated and often forgot who I was.\nI attributed my declining mental health to some innate problem with me. She frequently reinforced this idea, from \"kind\" words (\"you are very ill; you need help\") to blatant insults (\"you're crazy\").\nShe wouldn't let me leave the house by myself \"for my own safety\" because I might dissociate and walk into oncoming traffic or something. Once she drove me to work but instead of dropping me off she stopped the car on the other side of the parking lot, locked the doors, and yelled at me. I managed to unbuckle my seatbelt, unlock the door, and run for safety. She chased me down and security stopped me. They sent us home and called the cops. I was too afraid of my fianc\u00e9 to tell the cops the truth and told them what she wanted me to tell them. They left me to stay at home with my abuser.\nShe let me see a psychiatrist and a therapist but insisted on going with me to my appointments. I couldn't even see my primary care physician by myself. I attempted suicide several times during the relationship, especially when I was physically trapped because it was the only way out. She would not let me go to the hospital because it \"cost too much money.\" I remember one time I asked if I could have a professional take care of me since I had gotten to the point at which I spent more time dissociating than being coherent. She said no, again using money as the excuse.\nI am a computer programmer and earn $70k USD before taxes in an area where the cost of living is very low. We were short on money because she spent money like crazy on stupid stuff like half a dozen pairs of heels and video games she didn't have time to play. She was also in legal trouble and I had to pay her lawyer fees. She did not have a job, she dropped out of high school and was not pursuing her GED, and didn't do housework. She spent all day playing video games and masturbating.\nWhile all this was going on, we engaged in sexual activity multiple times a day. I had to service her almost every morning before work. It took over a year to get her to stop calling for phone sex on my lunch break. She wanted me to service her again in the evening. She typically requested that I dominate her - calling her sexist slurs that I did not want to say, doing some creepy sort of daddy/daughter role play, etc. But she still complained about how little sex we had. Because of certain biological traits, it was a hassle to engage in penetrative sex and she would not let the topic go. She completely disregarded all the other sexual activity.\nI was on medication for my anxiety and she usually administered my medication instead of letting me take it myself. I am fairly certain she stole my friend's medicine and gave it to me... And of course raped me while I was on those drugs. (My friend had been in a horrible car accident and was on oxy, lortabs, Vicodin, and some other serious drugs.)\nShe also made me get medical marijuana. I had previously smoked once or twice a month. She had me smoking daily until I got so high that - surprise, surprise - I was so incoherent that I not only couldn't legally consent to sexual activity, but I was also incredibly easy to be taken advantage of. Sometimes she went as far as to literally put the pipe up to my lips and light it for me rather than \"merely\" manipulating me into smoking weed.\nEvery time I was lucid enough to know who I was and that I would be better off without her, I tried to break up with her. This must have happened at least once a month, every month, for all of our relationship - including month one. She responded by threatening suicide, telling me it would be all my fault, and that if I called the hospital she would pretend to get better just so she could get out and kill herself.\nFinally I didn't care about all of that. I didn't care if the psychopathic rapist cunt died or who she blamed it on. It took several days, half a dozen people, and hundreds of dollars to get her out of my house. (My douchebag of a neighbor refused to call 911 when she physically restrained me to keep me in my house and I finally broke free... Otherwise the cops would have hauled her off for me.)\nWhat is it like? If I had never experienced anything like it I wouldn't be able to even comprehend the trauma. My words don't do justice to my experience.\nYet somehow I've been able to make remarkable progress recovering from PTSD. It takes a lot of effort to keep myself healthy, but I truly believe I will one day be able to look back on this and just shrug my shoulders as if it's normal to have survived dozens, if not hundreds, of sexual assaults.", "It's losing your freedom; losing your ability to speak, or to even voice out how you actually feel.\nYou become isolated, lonely, and helpless.\nYou lose even that little bit of love you have for yourself.", "It feels like you don't exist to that person.

It has come to the point where I cannot be myself around him anymore. And yet, I cannot leave him because my heart tells me I love him too much. He has broke up with me for no reason multiple times, because he knows I will just pretend nothing happened when he comes back. He has abused me verbally, abused my friends and my family. And he knows I won't leave, that I can't leave. Even if I do, I just end up going back to him begging him to take me back.\nLet me clarify. We are two people who love each other very much.

I've begged him to tell me what I did, I've cried, I've pleaded but he refuses to acknowledge I exist. I am a non-person to him. I'm just too tired to stand up to it now, so now I just give in and wait for him to apologize so that I can say it is okay and get on with our lives.\nOften, I don't even know the reason why he is being distant and unavailable. He says he needs his space. I am bewildered most of the time it happens. It sometimes catches me off guard and I feel guilty that I might have done something to upset him. So my mind keeps working on trying to figure out what I could have done wrong. I blame myself constantly.\nHe has never laid a hand on me. But most times, I feel threatened by his looks and actions. I am afraid of being humiliated in public and shouted at. Looking at me, nobody would tell what I am going through and to be honest, I am too ashamed to let anyone else know about this.\nHe gets mad at me for vague reasons and sometimes for non-reasons. One reason was that I upvoted a post on Quora that he didn't like. So now I think twice before upvoting anything. I cannot count the number of times I have been made to delete posts in Facebook which I found funny.

The most beautiful person you\u2019ve ever met, inside and out. He is perfect even as you realize he is under your league. He is intelligent even though he is a storybook clich\u00e9 of a stereotype. The abusive stereotype. But all you know is that he has a good heart and sometimes says cruel things but he doesn\u2019t mean them. He never means them, really, and when he does you know it was just a joke and you should have realized it was a joke. It\u2019s always a joke, your relationship, lighten up. He\u2019s not cruel, or abusive, actually; he is kind to his cat and tells his parents he loves them and he tells you that sometimes, too. He once wrote you hand-written letters.

Joyous occasions become engulfed in dread, the intuition that once kept you safe is brushed away as you tell yourself you're \"over reacting\" (anything to deny the harsh reality that has become your life).\n\nThe feeling that most sticks out to me is how often I thought to myself: \"this is like something out of a movie\" or \"I wish someone could see/hear this, because they'd never believe it would happen to me\". It was an out of body expierience. I couldn't believe I had become the girl who was hiding bruises, and lying to family and friends. Not me, that would never happen to me.\n\nMy boyfriend was handsome, charming, funny, kind, affectionate, doting, and spontaneously thoughtful...about 10-20% of the time. So I focused only on those times, the remainder of the time I made excuses for him. \"He came from an abusive family\", \"He's an addict but wants to stop\", \"Once he quits drinking/doing drugs, things will be great\", \"If I leave him, I am giving up on him\"...etc, etc. I thought I could help him, but failed to see the expense it was costing me in the process.

My friends dropped out of my life because I constantly was with him. He turned everything I did around on me and made me feel crazy and inferior to him. He was very attractive and constantly talked about how all of the girls at him work would hit on him, just to see my reaction. Hoping I would get upset. He somehow made me feel as though if I left him, I would never find anyone else. He believed he was as good as it got, and he wanted me to know it.\nHe tried to cut my wonderful family out of my life. I have a large but very close family and we get together sometimes. He would oftentimes try and stop me from going to see them, wanting to stay at our place. On the occasions that we did go out to see people he would shelter me, keeping me away from any social interaction.\nBut life with him was not all bad. I loved him with my whole heart. It was just a horrible addiction. That is the best way to describe it. After all the hurt he has caused me there are still so many things I miss so much about him; I hope that more time will continue to heal these wounds.\nUnfortunately he was not only emotionally abusive, but physically abusive as well. We would occasionally get in very bad arguments that would end in terrible yelling, screaming fights. I won't lie, I would yell too. Then I would say or do the wrong thing and he would hit me. The first time I had to see a doctor after being with him about a year following a particularly bad fight was when I should have known to leave, but I loved him and as I said, was so very addicted. Unlike other stories I have read where after the incident he turned oh so sweet and said how sorry he was, I'm not sure if he ever once apologized. Every time he hit me or bit me, which for some reason he also did, he turned it around on me. It always was my fault in some way. Even though I was the one bruised and crying, I was feeling sorry for something I had done because it was my fault and it was me that caused him to become violent. I obviously could have prevented this whole situation. These ideas were implanted in my head after every fight, and he was somehow able to persuade me easily that I was to blame. He was so great at mind games it was unbelievable.\nLuckily I had a wakeup call recently when it got to such a bad point I was unable to ignore it any longer. I called the police and got myself out of the relationship. I am still healing emotionally, although I think it is a long process and I do still find myself craving him at times . But I know to stay strong,and as much as I may want him that he is unhealthy for me.

Staying away was my worst \"white knuckle\" experience.\nIn 2003, I wrote this about what it was like to be with him in the late 90's when I was 18:\nThe first time you feel it . . . open hand across your cheek slow motion stinging shock disbelief, you're not even sure it really happened. You back up slowly staring slack jawed and dumb. You weren't in a fight. You hadn't said anything insulting. But he just pulled his hand back and slapped you. There was no reason. That makes it harder to understand.\nHe said a dream told him to do it. It doesn't make sense to you, but you stay anyway. He loves you.\nThe second time it happens, it's a little more real. Only this time you're discussing whether or not to get a phone line installed, you say yes, he says no. You don't even have a phone. He slaps you again. The discussion is over.\nThat isn't really the bad part.\nHe's watching you come home from the window and your unnattractive, yet pleasant and nice, male neighbor comes to chit chat with you, but you don't think anything of it. You walk inside to say your hellos and the he's watching you with cold eyes. He starts yelling at you because your neighbor was talking to you. This isn't new. He's yelled at you before because men you don't even notice look at you. And it's not just the yelling, it's not just that he's accusing you of cheating when you're not. You wouldn't even dream of it because you love him.\nHe says he'll cut you in half and make you watch as he pulls your guts out if he ever catches you. He calls you a whore and a bitch. He pulls his fist back and drops it to his side. He wants to make love.\nYou aren't allowed to see your friends because they're bad for you. You haven't seen a movie since you started dating him. You are never allowed to listen to the music you like. You live in a studio apartment together and the bathroom door is broken; you wanted to be alone. You spontaneously start crying and you tell him it's only because you miss your cat. But you love him and believe he is the only person who could ever love you, so you better not fuck up.\nYou eat what he tells you to eat and when he tells you to eat even if you are not hungry. You don't want to cause problems. When he wakes you up in the middle of the night [...] and he wants you to check the perimeter of the building with him, you do it without question. When he asks you for more money you start lying and tell him you paid the bills with it.\nYour best friend has been coming by trying to get a chance to hang out with you because it's been almost forever. He doesn't want her to get suspicious so he agrees to go out on a double date with her and her fiance. The two of you go over to their place for pizza, a movie and beer. You fall asleep halfway through the movie, your friend and her fiance retire to the bedroom and he's had 12 beers in the meantime. You wake up and he's three inches from your face holding you by the neck whispering. And you do whatever he says to get through the next moment.\n--\nA few months later I wrote this, a fast forward to being out:\nI sent him away. Then I wanted him back. The only man that would ever love the wretch that was me. He must have been sick. He was sick. I was sick and became ill.\nI would hope he sought help. If he sought help, in a few months he would be better. He would come back. I imagined living alone while I waited. I would go to the gym and loose more weight. I would grow my hair long for him. I imagined being the perfect person. I imagined I could forgive him. I imagined he would be pleased. He would still think I had potential. That we could be happy. Love would fix everything.\nHow violently he loved me.\nI sought legal counsel. (why didn't i turn the car around?) She advised me that an annulment would be difficult. (why didn't i leave him in the diner when we had the fight?) A divorce would be better. (why did i ever agree to meet him?) The monetary cost was the same. (why didn't i leave when slapped me?) It was just too expensive. (why didn't i ask for help?) I started the process myself. (why did i give the county clerk's office my real information?) I didn't understand the paper work at first. (why did i ignore the signs?) But I managed to fill it out correctly. (so tired) I called a canadian post office and asked how much it would cost per ounce to mail a package to the united states. (why didn't i leave him?) They would not let me purchase stamps via phone. (why didn't i tell the woman at the chapel that I didn't want to get married?) I found a place on the internet that specialized in collectible canadian stamps and had them send me the proper amount. (why did i stay?) I found a notary public near his mother's house. (why did i keep seeing everything over and over?) I put together a package, complete with \"sign here\" stickers and self addressed stamped envelope. (why couldn't i have just said \"no\"?) I sent the divorce papers.\nI cut my hair.\nEvery hour I sobbed reliving the trip to Las Vegas. I was stupid for not doing it differently. This was the only person who would want me and I ruined it. I was a failure. I was pathetic. I couldn't even stand up for myself. What the fuck was wrong with me? I hated myself. I could see us driving there are three a.m. he was drinking a beer. I was in my highschool homecoming dress. The black car in the dark night heading to the dead end. I could see us stopping at the rest stop. I went to the restroom peed and sobbed. I dried my eyes. I went back to the car. He went to the restroom. Why didn't I leave him there? Fucking idiot. He got back in the car we went to a chapel. They sent us to the county clerk's office. Why didn't I give them fake information or claim I forgot any identification? Worthless piece of shit. We went to eat breakfast at a diner nearby. I was trying to have a friendly conversation about anything. The silence was unbearable. I wanted us to be normal. He because angrier and angrier and yelled at me for speaking to him while we ate. Why didn't I run to the car and drive away? Stupid fucking goddamned worthless idiot. I took too much responsibility for failure.\nI made myself ill.\nI tore myself so far down my immune system stopped working. I had food poisoning the only 3 times I'd every had it in my life. My glands swelled to the size of cherry tomatoes. I had to quit my job. I had to move back home. I slept over 18 hours a day. I developed a serious infection. I couldn't function. A shower was exhausting. I lost weight. I slept over 20 hours a day. I got shingles. I got help. I got better. My dad just thought I was ill.\n---\nAnd like many others who have posted, my sense is I was set up by my past to not notice that something was wrong. Fortunately I also had enough skills from the past and support in the present to eek my wow and and grow away from that.\nBoth of my parents did better jobs than their parents. My dad, much better.\nThe way that I was raised, especially due to contributions from my mother are what made a lot of the early red flags from him seem normal. From as early as 9, and possibly earlier, my mother and I had very intense screaming matches that sometimes resulted in violence against me. As early as 7 I remember getting into an argument with her over her calling my younger sister \"Miss Piggy.\" My father says they started when I was a toddler because she took normal toddler behavior personally and freaked out. I understand now that it isn't that she wanted to hurt me in the big picture, she just didn't have the skills to be an effective, mature parent because of how her mother treated her. But then, I took it personally, and that so much dysfunctional intensity was normal, that was love. After all, she didn't mean what she said when she was angry.\nIt was also very important to her to keep up appearances. Don't acknowledge what \"is\", just act as if things are how she/the family wants them to be. With my father, facts are facts, and if you're not as good as others seem, that's something to be ashamed of.\nMy father was the better parent by far, usually calm, rational, logical, not violent with me nor my sister, he was never violent with my mom, but they did yell at each other a lot even after the divorce. The problem was how often he generalized my mom's behavior to all women. That all females are essentially bad (histrionic, emotional, manipulative, can't play by the rules, etc.)\nWell, I was female too, and a child. What I understand now that it was a generalization based on his experiences with women, as a child, with a child's understanding, I took that to mean that a large chunk of my being, that I had no choice about, was rotten. My dad, as the sane parent, was the one I aligned with, and I tried very hard to get rid of any trait that was female. What I know now, to attempt to suppress or destory a large chunk of oneself leads to a lot of self loathing. And this wasn't my only reason for self-loathing, but it was a contributing factor.\nAnother contributing factor was not being able to separate feeling bad, with being bad, which leads into a pretty shitty cycle, especially if you're already from a dysfunctional background, or went to high-school. I was also inappropriately sexually approached and contacted by two older cousins, at different times, and told about the first one, and was more or less blamed by the maternal relatives I told, so said nothing about the second. That was also very confusing and isolating and helped confim the belief or fear of inherent badness.\nSo, when I dated someone who said he loved me, the wretch that was me, wow. Of course I married him! I honestly don't remember what I liked about him, other than he was good looking and we liked a lot of the same things and we liked talking and he had great stories. And, a part of me believed that not only was it normal, but that I deserved it.\nThe context he came from: As early as 5 he watched his mom get beaten by a variety of men. He watched his mom have sex (probably get raped), and he even got hurt trying to protect his mom. At the time, and for some time after, his abuse felt deeply personal. At this time, and after lots of therapy and reading and education, I like to believe that his emotional, physical and sexual violence against me wasn't really personal. That he, like me, was also conditioned by his environment to think this was \"normal\"*. That way of thinking makes it hurt less now, but I don't think understanding that would have helped then. I also *never* want to see that version of him again, even 16 or so years later.\nTwo days after the night that started with him holding me by the throat and whispering, we were in the \"honey moon/I'm sorry\" phase. He was appalled with himself for what he had done, and he said he would rather kill himself than have me leave. I suggested he go visit his mom, and paid for a one-way bus ticket to her, for a break. In my heart, I knew it wasn't a break, but played it like it was, that we just needed time, that love would fix everything. On reflection, that manipulative female part that said and did that, probably saved my life.\nSelf-compassion, compassion, finding a supportive community, knowing I'm not alone, many more positive experiences, the belief that I can unlearn the patterns/conditioning that got me into this, the belief that most people are not like this, lots of therapy, learning new communication skills, lots of things I can't think of have helped. It also helps that I trust myself to take care of myself much better now.\n*I say we thought it was \"normal\" as if it isn't actually normal. But given the prevalence of abuse, or even just adverse child-hood experiences, it actually *is* sadly normal. What it isn't, however, is healthy.\nThanks for asking the question. And thanks to all of those that have answered your courage helped me in this exploration. In writing this, I found another layer of freedom from the past.", "Most people have talked about being in an an abusive relationship as an adult.\nBeing a child and being verbally abused means you don't even know you are being abused. I was always spoken to with irritation in the voice. I was always blamed for everything. I was berated. insulted. criticized. Eggshells? I wish I had been that smart. It never occured to me that I could make it stop. I believed that it was all my fault. It was just the way it was.\nIt wasn't until I was an adolescent that I started getting hit in the face. At that time I would argue back, knowing he wasn't making any sense, but given no chance to have my say. One example, when argueing I was told not to make gestures, even though he was gesturing all over the place. I tapped his hand to indicate that he was using gestures and that enraged him even more. Of course I got hit in the face.\nIn my twenties I was involved in a normal relationship and talked about the way I was raised. One time that guy said something about me being abused by my father and my first reaction was \"no, I wasn't\" I guess I thought that emotional abuse was not abuse. I believed that I was getting hit later because I had developed a taste for things that adolescents like and that was what he seemed to be mad about at that time mostly, such as sex and marijuana to be blunt.\nI didn't even know that he was drunk all the time, when I was about 17 or 18 my friend came over to pick me up. My father talked to him for a few minutes and I left with my friend. My friend said \"boy was he drunk!\" Astonished, I said \"he was?\" I had no idea. That was just the way he was.\nPoint being, abused children don't know that they are abused children. It's just the way it is.", "I was emotionally abused as a child. It was severe. Sometimes the emotional abuse was combined with demeaning physical abuse. With other aspects of strong family dysfunction to grow up with I had many problems functioning in a healthy manner. I knew that I had issues and was always mystyfied on how to overcome them. It took many, many years to recognize them all. Then, with very gradual personal awareness pushing me to seek answers, I researched the topics such as self-esteem, I practiced the solutions and most important of all learn to be genuinely truthful to myself. I was'nt always abused and sometimes I would be the manipulator, controller and sarcastic put-downer. It was hard to accept negatives about myself. I also learned that some of the abuse I got was alot worse or not as bad as I belived. I have to do things for myself and others because that's what I choose to do, willing to accept the consequences of my actions. I can't do as I hope the other person would be OK with my doing. I'll lose my identity pleasing people and not know how to please myself. Telling someone no can be horrifying, particullarly when there are threats, both lies and truths. I am still learning to say no and assert myself and I tell you, once you get to the other side and can accept 'no' and not change your mind and stick with your 'yes' you become happier and maybe understand peace and freedom.", "I've been shaking as I've been reading these, but I think I need to get this out there because my experience shows some other aspects to abusive relationships.\nI was a new Mormon missionary, and the second companion I had was a new leader in the mission (he was only a few months out and had been made an Zone Leader). He started being verbally abusive from the first day. He was physically abusive in short bursts. There was also a lot of spiritual abuse, with regular statements that I was incompetent, and that I was not fit for the mission, and that God hated me.\nThe experience was similar to what everyone else is describing. You walk on eggshells. You look for any sign that you've done something right. When something goes wrong you panic.\nI remember making a mistake trying to reach an area I'd never been to before. The streets didn't connect in the same way we were used to in other parts of the town. I got hopelessly lost, and I was supposed to be navigating. He hit me in the back of the head with his fist, berated me about it and made me knock on a door to get directions. He was as lost as I was, and knew the area as well as I did, but all of the fault laid on my shoulders.\nHe was in a position where he had a lot of responsibility put on him, and all of the stress was taken out on me, as his companion. I have a lot of problems even articulating how this is, because it's not like there were visible bruises on my face, but I was with this guy 24-7 for 4 and a half months straight. The verbal assault never ended, from 6 in the morning to 9 at night.\nCombined with the minor physical and major verbal abuse, I got a lot of religious abuse. There's something about using religion to manipulate people that hits harder than words, or even fists. After being with him a week, I was deeply depressed.

The mythology of the Mormon mission experience puts the experience of the rest of your life squarely on how you perform while on your mission. I came home feeling that I had failed, and that the rest of my life would inevitably be a failure. It took a significant amount of time and 3 therapists to pull most of that idea out by it's roots. Even when objectively I was extremely successful, I felt like a failure and that everything would be taken away from me because I had failed God.\nThe ecclesiastical structure of a Mormon mission is extremely loose. There is a mission president, two counselors and occasionally 3-5 sets of retirees who serve as missionaries. The rest of the mission is controlled by 19 and 20 year old boys. In some situation it ends up pretty Lord Of The Flies. I had nowhere to turn. My mission president just advised me to get along with him better. He was the zone leader. He was friends with the AP's. We were instructed quite forcefully to only talk about positive things in our letters home.\nI had the advantage in that I wasn't married to this guy, I had an end date in sight. But the structure of the mission, and quite literally never being able to get away from him has caused a huge impact on how I deal with religious authority figures. I used to fear them. Now,I tell them to fuck off.", "As others have said, highs and lows. My perspective, I am a man with a verbally abusive wife, we've been together almost 19 years. I don't believe in anger, it is destructive, so I try my best not to indulge in it. She doesn't have that hang up.\nOn the low side, it's like walking on egg shells, unreasonable expectations are placed on you, EVERYTHING Is your fault, the littlest things are a big deal, you don't measure up to others by comparison, you are judged insufficient for what you should be, and if you haven't done anything wrong lately, that doesn't matter, cause you were never forgiven for anything you ever did in the first place, so get ready to hear about all that again. If you try to defend yourself, you are in the wrong, any grievance you bring up is turned and pointed back at you, so if you made the mistake of say, pointing out the abusive behavior, you are now the one that is abusive.\nThere is a pattern to the cycle. In my case, lately, I've noticed that things are fine for a couple days after sex (not the only trigger, and it hasn't always been a trigger, just lately).Then the egg shells are hard to miss, I usually avoid sleeping in the bedroom around this time because the rants can come in the middle of the night and I hate being woken up for them. I've gotten good at sleeping on couches and chairs. Soon after she verbally tears into me with about anything she can remember, a lot of the type of stuff I mentioned above. I've found it shortens her rants just to allow it to run its course, sometimes she is so off base with a point that I can't let it go without correction, but really that's just semantics because she always has plenty to rant about.\nMy self esteem hits the toilet for a couple days, cause some of the abuse is at least close to the truth, otherwise it wouldn't be affective verbal abuse, just the rantings of a really crazy person. At this point, if I was single again, though I have a lot of admiration for women in general, I don't think I would date because I could not trust another woman to allow her to get close enough to say these kinds of things to me. That idea of \"what if it's not her, it's me\" plagues you.\nOf course, at this point, I'm in the wrong for not really wanting to talk to her or be around her for a while, you know, cause I'm \"passive aggressive\", there's no way she would ever acknowledge that I just need a little time to heal from her rants. She does not apologize as a general rule, I can count the number of times she has given a true apology to anyone in our family on one hands in the time I've known her. You know, the kind that is contrite and not followed by an excuse.\nIn my case, I stay because we have children together. If I left she would probably get a good share of custody and just take her anger out on them. As it is, I can tap off her anger and keep her from abusing them. She doesn't want to hurt them, she was abused by her parents, but most times she has gotten close to anger with them she has easily shifted her assaults to me because I made myself available, no doubt it was my fault she was angry anyway, she just needed to point it the right way (cause, did I mention that EVERYTHING is my fault?) I relish the thought of when they are old enough to get away though, I believe my freedom is close behind, I suppose though it can be more complicated than that.\nAs for the highs, it really is a high by comparison, but its tainted by the knowledge that it is just a matter of time, or the right trigger. I suppose the highs used to be higher, but I've grown weary of the pattern so I notice that they are only high by comparison. Lately I have tried to avoid contact and sex but that only works so long, hey, I'm a guy and if I'm not going to her for attention she tends to get more sexually aggressive with time. Did I mention that I'm just a guy? Anger I can refuse, the guy thing is a little deeper rooted.", "on the emotional side, depending on how long you resist an abusive relationship, at the end you stop feeling like a functional human being", "I'm a guy that was married to violent rape related - PTSD infected woman. All people / women need; must to have their abusers prosecuted. Being in an abusive relationship is almost impossible to describe. The abuser is overflowing with guilt, shame, lack of control over themselves, lacking power over their own body and mind. They have a terrible relationship with themselves. They attempt to transmit what is bad about themselves onto their partner until the abuser recognizes themselves and removing anything that is good from the partner's personality. Punishing, hurting, abusing you seems to lessen their pain - temporarily; what they think and feel about themselves and gives them a high = Psychopaths, a slow drain of happiness from the world. Everyday becomes a thunderstorm in your mind. Someone physically hurting you with the constant memories of all the times you have ever been hurt while, having the worst flu, and being yelled at non - stop all at the same time. Constant Fear is the mind killer. You compartmentalize your thoughts, hide positive emotions; think everyone is like them and is going to hurt you. If you ever feel you don't like yourself = someone is criminal in your life, needs to go to prison. You need Away from them. They will hurt you and anyone else that they possibly can.

From reading the answers it seems to me like only girls have spoken up so far. I'm a guy who got mentally (and physically) abused by an incredibly beautiful 90 pound girl.\nDuring one and a half years I went from feeling like the luckiest man in the world, to feeling like I was stuck in a nightmare, a slippery hole where every attempt to get out pushed me further down. I used to think that the things that happened in that relationship, the level of mental abuse and stress I was under was worse than anything I had ever seen in a movie. At the end of that relationship I had gone from being a really sociable guy who does great in school do a hollow shell who couldn't even muster the energy to leave his apartment. In many ways I felt like Gollum in LOTR. I couldn't be without her but every second I spent with her sucked the energy out of me and completely changed me.\nIt didn't come all at once. Everything came gradually and that's why I allowed it to happen.\nThere's an endless list of how she kept me \"under control\". She was extremely possessive of me. But the biggest leverage she had on me was her constant threats to commit suicide if I didn't do what she wanted me to do. Whenever I was really determined to actually do something like meeting my friends (she wouldn't allow it), first of all she would throw a fit, screaming, crying, throwing stuff, hitting me... so I would stay in. If I sometime got to meet my friends, it wouldn't take long before I started getting messages saying she was sitting at a bridge just about to jump off... Which of course meant I had to leave suddenly without explanation...\nTo everyone but me she was this super happy, funny, social girl who was super popular. No one knew besides me.\nSomething that really made me lose sleep at night was the thought that if she some day finally committed suicide, everyone in the town we lived in would've thought I was the one abusing her, driving her to suicide.", "I must say that as a people in this country we have lost people to teach us about love, game, how to love, turning on your intuition buttons and SELF LOVE. Self Love allows confidence and patience to set in so you'll think clearly, set standards, properly Court, check out ones gene pool/personality traits all are so important to know. It is time we Man / Woman Up and stop whining and take the blame personally. You have to be an idiot to let looks, social pressure (friends/family telling you who to date/screw/marry) money, car and TV tell us who and how to date. Due to all the divorce and single parents and over worked parents there is a void for someone to teach us the Game!!!! That blame does come to an end because one gets to an age limit where he stops blaming what they didn't have or don't know, go forth and seek knowledge in books or groups or speak to people who are successful in dating or relationships!! No matter what color, shape or size we see these successful people and never ask them how they do it why?\nThe successful men are confident, study and know when to walk graciously.\nThe women, had good men in their families or they're confident in themselves, manage their feelings/box and know when to take their walk.

Mom was correct, we should leave people alone and stop judging. Learn your DNA! Social pressure teaches us to judge men/women that live with their parents at 30 or older saying it's a crime, not even knowing they may have potential, a plan, saving money for a business, home, car or helping their parents due to layoffs/economy.

Although some partners may find being verbally and emotionally abusive will suffice in their bid to control their partner/ satisfy their need for dominance - it is often just an intense incident or 2 before it can escalate in to physical abuse. Bottom line: abuse is abuse no matter if it's physical, verbal, or emotional. All forms of abuse are horrible and completely inexcusable, you should know that ANYBODY who claims to love you would never feel OK to do anything intentionally to make you feel upset, or cause you pain.", "I was in one a few years back. At the beginning, he was just my friend's brother & we ended up getting close and finally being in a relationship. The first year was normal & really good. However, I had a long vacation planned & once I came back, things started to go downhill.\nAt the beginning it was just the small mood swings, that would range from the excessive need to feel \"loved\" by me to anger/rage over the simplest things. I had a close group of friends (both guys & girls) and he was included too. Slowly, he started pointing out things he didn't like with my friends & started asking me to spend time with him rather than with them, even if we were in the same place.\nWe were in college at that time (though I was a year ahead of him), and we ended up taking a class together. That's when things exploded. During one study session, he got angry over something trivial (like me playing with my phone while he was solving a question) and ended up breaking all my credit cards & ID cards and tearing all the cash in my wallet. Another time, I had a hard cover book thrown at me across the parking lot.\nKeep in mind that I live in a country where out of marriage relationships are frowned upon, so I couldn't tell my family and everyone, just a few select trusted friends.\nLater on, he started calling the house phone at all times of the night, when my parents where at home. Also, he drive all the way to my house & park in front of it while calling & asking for me, threatening to tell my parents or to walk into the house. Feeling so helpless & desperate then, I had to wake my sister up in the middle of the night & tell her everything, all while I was hysterical. She managed to talk to him & calm him down & get him to leave.\nI decided to meet him and go for a drive to talk things over. The minute I brought up taking a break, he stopped the car in the middle of the road (with other cars driving around us) & didn't move until I agreed to give him a second chance.\nAfter that, the hitting began & I had to cover up my bruises from everyone around me. By this time, I had pulled away from all of my friends & was losing my self-esteem. I got depressed and would cry all night. I also began suffering from severe migraines and would use them as an excuse (I couldn't drive) so that I wouldn't have to meet him.\nOne day, my friend caught sight of a bruise on my arm, and asked my about it. I remember clearly dismissing it as \"Oh, I just bumped into the car side mirrors\" (It was about the same height off the ground). She kept pushing it, but I couldn't open up to her, because I was so ashamed that I couldn't leave him & was making excuses for him.\nI convinced him to go to see a therapist & we had several sessions, and I did talk to his friends & ask them to talk to him. There were times in between where it felt like nothing had ever happened and things were going to well, but those were far and few in between.\nAnother time, we were in the car together, but this time I was driving, and he got pissed and pulled the steering wheel to the side, making my car spin out of control. He also punched the rearview mirror, breaking it. That caused me to hyperventilate & have a panic attack (because, how was I going to explain that to my dad?). He also tore my dress open & slapped me.\nTo me, the slap on my face was my wakeup call. I excused all the previous actions, however, that slap, which til this day I still remember clearly, was just the one thing I couldn't excuse. Needless to say, I finally mustered up the courage, broke up with him, and managed to stick to my guns.\nHe continued threatening me, showing up in front of my house, and begging me to come back (though phone calls, msgs, emails) but I kept ignoring every single time. It was very scary, knowing that he might actually do something, but I kept telling myself \"if he wanted to, then he would already have\"\nThat feeling of helplessness, desperation, dependency, humiliation, hysteria, loneliness is something I will not let myself experience ever again. Once it starts, no matter how much you try to change or be patient, it will always be there. I do not believe an abusive relationship can get better, or that the abuser can change (in that specific relationship).", "Hi, I have been in a similar situation but for a shorter period. The thing that helped me was going to the police. The police talked to him that unless he stopped contacting me, following me or harassing me I would get a restraining order against him and that worked. I have had bouts of both anger and regret but I work my way through them and realize that what I did was correct.", "An abused husband's perspective\nThese answers all ring true. I'm a guy with two kids and my wife is abusive (never in front of the kids so far). Last night I called the police after she grabbed a knife and threatened to kill herself. By the time they had arrived she had bitten, scratched and kicked me in an attempt to stop me calling them, and as a result of the assault she was arrested and taken away.\nI was given an number of standard questions by the police when I made my statement - all have been mentioned above:\nDoes she attempt to isolate you from your friends and family?\nIs she unreasonably jealous?\nIs she controlling?\nDoes she desire secrecy in your relationship?\nIs your relationship unbalanced?\n\nThere were a bunch of others that I can't remember, but the following is also true:\nShe has difficulty apologising, it's always \"I'm sorry but you made me angry\"\nIt's almost impossible to offer her a counter point to her feelings. Any attempt at trying to offer her a different point of view is taken as me not respecting or disregarding her feelings.\nShe takes any words that come out of my mother's mouth as a form of criticism and any interest that she has in my life as interference (see isolation above).\n\nThere are some additional factors that have led me to take the abuse as long as I have:\nShe's from another country (asian), therefore making the logistics of splitting with 2 kids more difficult.\nIn most other aspects of her character (when she's not feeling down) she's a lovely person.\nI'm literally twice her size so although the first couple of times were a shock and hurt emotionally I'm not in any real physical danger.\nI have a very long fuse so I don't really think there's much chance of me reciprocating... I guess you never know though on that front.\nI have seen some improvement (or rather had up until a week or so ago)\nShe's beautiful, strong, the mother of my children and can be very caring and sweet and I want to help her.\nI love her.\n\nI also feel some level of culpability for the state that she's in (not much - just an underlying sense of responsibility). She moved here (the UK) at very short notice, away from her family whilst pregnant - we had only been together about 6 months at the time. I was extremely blind to her needs and what she was going through at the time. She didn't communicate those needs at all well, but I feel a strong sense of shame that I put her through what I did just from sheer selfishness.\nI think family background is an important factor in her behaviour - her sisters also share her ferocious temper, inability to accept not getting their own way and innate belief that they can do what they want. Part of this is cultural, she comes from a well off family in a 3rd world country. Part of it (related to the culture) is that her Dad is an asshole who does what he want (including cheating repeatedly on her Mum) because he's rich and he can.\nAt the moment she's staying with my Dad's partner (who is a foster carer and has dealt with a great many troubled people from abusive backgrounds). She seems to be listening and absorbing the fact that she's at fault here and she's agreed to get counselling/therapy.\nI don't know what the future holds. At the moment I'm assuming that I'm going to end up as a single father to my two kids, but I hold out some hope that she will make some changes in her life that will enable us to rebuild our relationship. I think that she finally understands that what she has done is unacceptable and that her behaviour is a real issue. I hope with all my heart that she can face her demons and overcome them.\nWow - this is the longest thing I've ever written on the internet! Keep you fingers crossed for us :-)", "Every answer here is right on. For me there was a high. The getting back together phases. Also having been a battered child I did not think my relationship was abusive for the first 3 years because there was no violence. I think one of the big things for me that hooked me was he would tell me I was his \"soulmate\". He did do some wonderful and meaningful things for me in the first 6 months. I saw that as him being protective of me. No one had ever been protective of me before in my life so this was what I had dreamed of. In retrospect I believe this and the fact he would tell me one thing and then act in an opposite way hooked me. His ambivalence, the fact he almost was mine.\nHe would use jealousy as a way to manipulate me and after I would leave there were even a few months we would stay apart. But then he would come around my friends. Or casually be hanging out somewhere I would see him.\nHe put himself in the right place for me to be the initiator. Then there was the fact he was always angry but a hidden rage. And usually not directed at me except for the sarcasm or the pseudo comments. Things like I needed to get my haircut and I would look better. Or I could dress the way I liked but it was just not his taste. I was so hooked and needed his approval. This mimicked my earliest relationships. My cold withdrawn dad and my disapproving mother.\nI was hardwired this was what love feels like. As time went on I went to therapy and got stronger. It took someone else to point out certain patterns to me. He would be provocative then when I reacted he would act as if I was to blame. then I would be sucked into proving I wasn't. Then he became violent.\nAnd had the nerve to blame me and act like I was a monster for calling the police. So again I begged forgiveness.\nIn my relationship of 7+ years, there were really fun times. He bought me presents which I grew to be obsssed with because again it repeated my family of origin. I did not realize that he was sabotaging my successes. I did not realize that I literally was losing all self esteem and becoming dependent on his opinion. Until I did. Until I did realize all that. And I was so horrified I wanted him anyway. That was the lowest part for me. That was my bottom. I went through a big deal medical issue. And he abandoned me emotionally and physically right at the beginning of it. But this time I actually told him off. I told him things I had never dared to say. And I stopped talking to him. Period. One day at a time. He tried all his old tricks but I never gave in. I wish I could say it got easier. It's been a year now and I still have the rare time when I think we can be \"friends.\" but that is a lie. I can not speak to this guy. He is very abusive. And I buy into it. I am responsible for my own happiness. And I want a happy life. So I just don't pick up the phone. I am moving as well. So he cant suddenly be in my area. It turns out he showed up in my tiny town Christmas eve. He showed up at the store of a friend of mine and she threw him out. Luckily I had no idea at the time. That was true friendship. Again sorry if this narrative is all over the place. This is the first time I have told it to anyone but a few close friends. I am happy now. I intend to protect myself and stay that way.", "Ask yourself this one question.\n\"Am I leading a double-life?

I'm not an American, and I live in a place where a relationship could actually hurt a woman's reputation, so keep that in mind if some things don't make sense to you as a westerner.\nIt all started in college, we were a group of 5-6 girls and 3 guys including me, and I particularly liked one of those girls, I also felt that she liked me, but we never really talked about it, and I used to tell that \"friend\" who -at the time- was close to me about her and how much I liked her, I really did, and I was her closest friend.\nA year after, she suddenly stopped talking to me, and shortly after those two guys too, it felt like they were trying to find an excuse for it! But she never had a real excuse from my point of view, she just stopped talking to me one day.\nI saw her with him a few times throughout college, but I never assumed that they were in a relationship, I just thought that she had found a friend in him while I was out of the picture, and I hated her for it, I felt that he wasn't worthy of that.\nFour years later, a year after graduation, I got a message from a fake Facebook account, it was this girl who kept saying that she loved me and that she knew me really well, and she did, she told me things that only a few people knew about me, I suspected every single girl I've known in my whole life, but never her, never.\nShe later revealed who she really was after I insisted on knowing, and it was then, during a phone call, that she started telling me about what really happened back in college. Apparently, the guy also liked her at the time and he didn't tell me about it, instead, he went to her and told her that I was bragging to people about how much she liked me! She was really hurt, and her first mistake was taking his word for it! A few months after he successfully isolated her from me, he expressed his feelings to her, she rejected him, but he kept trying until he finally got her to say yes, her second a biggest mistake.\nWhat followed was four years of psychological abuse, he isolated her from all of her friends and abused her in every way possible, and with no prior experience in relationships, she was at his mercy. She started realizing how awful he was a few months later, she tried to get out, but he started getting verbally offensive and threatened her of telling everyone about their relationship, and that was pretty much his primary weapon against her. Her dad was a man in his 60's and she feared that something would happen to him if he knew, especially that he always tried to keep his family very close. Her situation was perfect for him, an old father and no brothers or close friends ... He was in control.\nWhat's worse is that he knew that deep inside, she still loved me, and actually brought it up a number of times with her, but he still held her captive! By the time she was done talking, she was rushing in tears, I kept blaming her for not telling me back then, I would've done something, she said that she wanted to, but she learned that what she believed was a lie, and she felt guilty for treating me like she did back then, so she thought that it was inappropriate to ask me for help! I was furious.\nA few minutes later, while we were talking on the phone, he called. She told me that it was him and didn't pick up, he then texted her saying that he would call her dad and tell him everything unless she picks up. I told her not to.\nI then told her that to decide whether we end up together or not, we needed to get this over with, that we need to take away his leverage if it means telling her father, and after some discussion about her father's health condition, we agreed on telling her cousin, she did, and later her cousin called him and asked him stay away from her.\nI needed him to know that she wasn't alone, and a phone call from her cousin was apparently not enough. He knew that her cousin wasn't in the same city, and that he wasn't particularly concerned with the issue because he didn't know that he was abusing her, he just knew that she didn't want him in her life anymore.\nA week later, I went to him, and basically told him that I would break his arms and legs if he ever tries to go anywhere near her again, I wasn't decided yet on whether or not I'd get into a relationship with her, but it was so very wrong what she's been through.\nWe did end up together, we've been in love for two years now, and it's the most beautiful relationship I've ever been into, she's a beautiful person, honest, warm, and forgiving, nobody has ever made me so happy, and I did my best to make her recover.\nWhat happened made me extra conscious about how I treat women, and it's what made me write this answer. If you are being abused, get help now, you are entitled to live a better life, nobody deserves to live in fear like that, not you, not anyone!", "The biggest things for me are that I am constantly afraid and that I constantly question myself. Your average person interacting with me would not guess this, but people I get close to can tell.\nOne example of questioning myself: I questioned whether I \"deserve\" to answer this question since the abuse never got physical (though I can't believe it wasn't heading that way as things got worse and worse toward the end).\nHe seemed to be crazy about me at first, but there were tiny glimpses. A few weeks after we started dating, we had sangria. I was young and had no experience with alcohol. He was a lot older. I had too much and he thought my drunk self was annoying. I was silly for a little bit but then felt sick and started to throw up. He got up without a word and left. The next morning I was angry, but he was so sweet and so sorry.\nA few months later I was pregnant. I visited family in another state. He'd been so sweet ever since that night, but one day on the visit I was texting with him and something completely harmless made him say something cruel and angry (I can't even remember what). I cried and called him. He called back a few hours later and was so sweet and so sorry.\nI went back and moved in with him. There would be glimpses of this every now and then. One night I wanted to try a bite of his sandwich, but I didn't want the end bite because it was mostly bread. (What can I say, I was pregnant.) He exploded at me and called me selfish and a bitch and said that I could never leave him in peace. I seriously could not believe I'd just been yelled at that I was a bitch for what may have been an annoying request but was, on the whole, not really a heinous offense. I argued with him and then just started crying when he wouldn't let up about how awful I was. An hour later he was so sweet and so sorry.\nAnd I was so pregnant. I also was estranged from my family. I wasn't going anywhere.\nThis went on for a long time -- explosions here and there, lovely the rest of the time. The year after I had the baby, he was pretty awful all the time, but I don't actually remember much of it. I was so exhausted and my mind is almost completely a blank from that entire year. I remember that I chalked it up to the stress of being a new parent though.\nAfter that he improved for a while, but then it went slowly downhill again over a few years until it ended up with him making physical threats.\nThe thing is that I know it sounds like this is all so obviously unacceptable, but it creeps up on you. It was complicated for me because I have a psychiatric disorder and it was really easy for him to convince me that I was imagining things or had the wrong view of things. Like taking candy from a baby, they say... I had to actually gather evidence (things I knew for certain he'd said or done) and then compare it to the statements of outsiders. I had to find out what outsiders believed was unacceptable since I did not trust myself to judge. I remember hearing a discussion among girlfriends once about how any man who calls them a name is OUT. I thought that sounded really picky. After all, my partner had called me a bitch and a cunt many times and he was still nice... As he always told me, \"You know I say things I don't mean when I'm angry. Don't focus on it.\"\nI knew intellectually that I wasn't a terrible person, but I came to feel ashamed of and disgusted by myself about many things. He said I was lazy even though I handled many more things than he did. He wouldn't let me learn how to drive for a long time so I used public transit to make what should have been fifteen minute trips in an hour or more. (This was a good excuse for him to disallow me from going out with friends -- it took too long.)\nThere were many times when I'd go to sleep after having been yelled at and berated for hours and think to myself that I had to leave, but I'd always wake up in the morning and feel like that wasn't actually an option, like I'd been overreacting.\nThough the events over a few days that made me finally decide once and for all to leave were more complex than this, I will just say that there was a sudden medical emergency and it was briefly thought that I might be dying. I sat there and realized that I might die not ever having left that horrible man. It was a terrible sort of pain.

You might hear about the time you helped someone more than you realized by listening, or put out positivity into the world when someone really needed it.\nNeedless to say, don\u2019t go asking people who, themselves, don\u2019t recognize your worth now - negative, toxic people - but putting it out there in a casual way might get you some real insights into why you are so darn valuable\u2026even if you don\u2019t see it yourself.\nSo, something in an email, social media post or talk\u2026\n\u201dHey, I know this might sound like an unusual request, but I\u2019ve been really working on myself lately and would love to know what you think my greatest strengths are, what you think I\u2019m good at, and what you like about me\u2026as a part of my journey.

First, Terry Fox, a Canadian who ran roughly a marathon every day to raise money for cancer, until he died from it in 1981. Second, is Emil Zatopek, a Czech who at age 16 was working in a shoe factory and at age 30 decided to try his hand at running a marathon. He won, and if you Youtube the video, there was not even another runner in sight behind him. It was 1952, and he had just won his third gold medal of those Olympics. If Terry Fox can run a marathon a day while dying of cancer, and Emil Zatopek can win an Olympic gold medal in his first marathon at age 30, what can you do? With gradually increasing training, all of the above.\nTo learn your true net worth, somebody named John once wrote \u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16, New King James Version. Turn a few more pages to the book of 1 Corinthians, chapter 12 and you see what Paul wrote to the church at Corinth that there is \u201ca diversity of gifts\u201d (verse 4).

After half a year, you will start becoming more self aware of your weakness that is holding you back from seeing your worth and your strength.

The truth is, we worried too much about what the wrong people say to you and don't care enough what the right people say about you. It is important to surround yourself with the right people at all times, to pin point your strength and weakness so that you can be encouraged every step of the way. Finding someone that can do that is a dime of dozen, stay positive and look out for people who is genuinely wants what's best for you.\nLearn new things constantly - you want to be able to relate with as much people as possible. To be more specific, learn to experience other people's perspective. Their pain, their joy and every gritty little thing. Once you learn this, you realized that everyone is the same as you to some extend.\nCelebrate your victory - no matter how small the accomplishments, do something to praise it. Don't judge your accomplishment based on someone else' expectation. Other people will expect you to do the impossible, things they can't do themselves.\nDo meaningful things - contribute to your local community, volunteer at your church, work at children's bootcamp, do things that associate with people. And see how your action can change other people.\nThe truth is, you had nothing to compare yourself against. It seems unfair that people have all the advantages while you are stuck in the ditch.\nThe problem is we expect the starting point to be all equal like in Olympic. But the reality is, we are not.

That\u2019s pretty clever that CARL, is claiming that ADHD-PI is a variation of character, this is the type of thinking that causes one to fall into addictions of cycles, causes inadequacy and creates perpetual imposter syndrome. It\u2019s absolute and utter nonsense. A character difference based on social bench-marks is not the same thing, as loosing millions of dollars over a life-time due to neurotypical discrimination of cognitive standards of linear thinking. A character difference is absolute BS, ADHD-PI is not a choice, character is something you cultivate through your voluntary efforts to make a desirable new personality characteristic occur. What you need to realize, is that many of the truths you\u2019ve heard about society and general common sense is utter nonsense. Every-single time I\u2019ve ever investigated in any sense of depth on a given topic, this so-called generally accepted scientific information is full of utter non-sense often through select confirmation bias, fallacious studies, and quote picking to support their agenda\u2019s. Why does this matter? Well, your basically accepting the fact, that brains mature until the age of 25, this is not a fact. It was done by a few substantiated studies reviewing cortical brain maturation of the PFC, or prefrontal cortex and they measured this thickness. This does not make it a fact or even a general truth, it\u2019s simply an observation or a potential hypothesis. When you read something, you need to read a primary source or academic journals even if your not in college, this is how you discern rule truth without having to depend on media. For example, If I want to take a new drug, I review the double-blind case studies and see the results of the control group vs the test group. If I find their are no replicated studies then I will not expect much from this new novel drug. If I take a drug for my ADHD-PI, I will review the mechanisms, how it works, why it works, what are the pros-cons and what can I get form it. Now back to your question even if it is inaccurate. Do ADHD-PI brains mature slower?\nWell, maturation assumes that we reach a neurotypical standard at some-point but this is nonsense as well. These are permanent deficits you are born with and you will die with. A child with no arms might grow longer and his missing arm by grow bigger, but the arm never regenerates to what it\u2019s supposed to be. It\u2019s this type of thing. Their is literature that shows, that yes some aspects of the brain seem to develop slower, such as lesser thickness of the PFC relative to neurotypical control groups, some studies show less white-matter density in the amgydala and a overal 10% small limbic system. Their has been literature to substantiate an overdeveloped cerebellum and a generally smaller nucleus accumbens even after it reached full cortical maturation. Even for myself, You could say I had delays. I wet the bed chronically until around 4, my bladder control was much slower to develop, it toke me longer to walk apparently, so I\u2019ve been told. It\u2019s arguable that my emotional and social skills were significantly reduced in comparison to other kids my own age. Elementary school was a very confusing time for me, I didn\u2019t understand anything, why did we do what we do? I didn\u2019t get other kids and was an outcast because of this. My emotional and social development was probably impaired in some sense, because other kids seemed to be able to do things, I couldn\u2019t do. They could collaborate more, they could socialize more efficiently and their was a place, they belonged to. In middle-school and high-school it\u2019s probably possible, you could argue that I was developmentally delayed in some aspects of socialization, I didn\u2019t do much of what my highschool acquitances did, they went to proms, joined clubs and seemed to have a direction, I didn\u2019t really care about any of this stuff. My impulse control was so poor that I felt enslaved to the immediate right now. The concept of popularity made no sense either, the concept of tact made no sense, being blunt made no sense to me, getting along with people made no sense to me. Dating women? Forget about it, I didn\u2019t understand how to approach a girl or even know how to talk to one. Middle-school was more of the same consistent social outcast. My pre-school report cards noted, that I was impulsive, preferred playing alone and didn\u2019t get along with others, had poor bladder control etc. This is when I was 4 years old, I am now 23. That was 19 years ago and many of these deficits still exists.\nThe problems in highschool are the same problems I still have. So no, the cortical maturation theory is nonsense, their is no cognitive improvement over time. My abstract thinking and last brain development occurred around 16 and I\u2019ve been the same intellectually ever sense. I don\u2019t feel any different than I did when I was 16, I have problems with focus, I still zone out like crazy, I still have tons of thoughts running through my head, You could argue I\u2019m still a social outcast in a sense in a neurotypical society. I am unable to keep consistency, just like when I was 15 and tried to write a 2 peoms a day no matter what. I always failed around 30\u201340 days. I still am socially blunt and abbrasive, I still am paranoid and inherently distrustful other others, just like I was as a highschooler. I still have panic attacks and anxiety. Am I a different person then what I was 5 years ago? Sure am. I\u2019m more aware more happy, and a harder worker with a better work ethic, and my personality is unrecognizable, that was through hard-work. But a TRUE- ADHD-PI person has cognitive involuntary behavioral traits that will always be present, it\u2019s not a choice. People don\u2019t get this. So are brains possibly develop later on but we maintain these deficits even once we fully mature, we never catch up to a neurotypical. I know 18 year old kids, who have better impulse control than I do, they have more tact and have arguably superior brains. So this maturation theory is nonsense.\nOh I wanted to ADD My current deficits: I\u2019ve a poor sense of direction and have problems discerning right from left, poor problems planning, inability to prioritize something of importance vs some of interest, facial blindness or I\u2019m not able to see things in front of me, diminished empathy I really don\u2019t care about other people, inability to filter words or bluntness, inability to persevere to delayed-gratified outcome, poor capacity to socialize in cooperative fashion to achieve a long time result, inability to PERFORM at a given task consistently or in other-words some days I perform well other days I don\u2019t, rumination cycles or inability to stop thinking thoughts, incredibly scattered my thought process is a chaotic tornado,poor impulse control, I hate waiting and am bad at long-term planning, impaired sustained attention, Chronic forgetfulness and carelessness of details, problems with following a set of dance setups in a sequential fashion or I have a problem with interpreting directions, unable to hold down a job, socially inept at social politics of neurotypicals beyond superficial charm. inability to filter out information therefore everything appears important, task-avoidance or avoiding tasks even though I know I should be doing them, problems managing finances or impulsive spending, working-memory issues I forget why I was working towards a goal, unable to execute and finish something consistently from start to finish, I get tired very easily, TIME-BLINDNESS WITHOUT a calendar I typically study 3 or 4 days before an exam, sometimes I can study a week in advanced that\u2019s about it, incapable of self-motivating myself consistently. I have so many fucking neurocognitive brain deficits it\u2019s not even funny. You think you know something about ADHD-PI but you don\u2019t,. My brain is extremely sensitive TO ANYTHING or it will not perform whether you want it to perform or not. It is a profound condition.

Sometimes neurodevelopmental conditions don't directly cause delays and it may be a comorbid illness or stress from the environment that causes more issues than the condition itself.\nAn ADHD will certainly develop differently than a neurotypical brain, but who's to say that difference is delayed, just because it isn't developing in a way that is considered normal by society?\nMany people with ADHD do have difficulty with emotional maturity though and this is likely due to stress and anxiety caused by expectations of a neurotypical society. An ADHD brain is typically running much faster than most though and so some areas of development can actually be well ahead.\nTheir ability to multi-task can be really useful in today's fast-paced society, and the amount of creative energy they have can also be very beneficial. People with ADHD tend to care much less of what other people think of them and this can be an advantage for many.\nI think overall, there will be certain developmental delays in an ADHD brain, but how many of these delays are in fact not delays, and just variations of character that are not confined to rigid societal benchmarks?", "That\u2019s a good question and I do not know the answer.

To know what one is talking about there has to be a clear definition.\nEgo is a subconscious identification with thoughts: A thought based sense of self, created by compulsive erroneous thinking. Also called the conditioned mind.\nOnes real self is the observer, not the observed, and not limited to the mind made sense of self, which is why many suffer. This is the false self that causes blindness and suffering like a parasite, fed with yet more thoughts.\nSo the false self is a mindmade illusion: Only existing due to compulsive thinking which is followed by the man who believes that those thoughts are equal to reality and truth: Under here define whom he is. That false perception of self, the ego, is cause of all suffering.\nSpiritual enlightenment is in fact about realising ones true self. This will free a human from endless form based charmic slavery.\nThe true self is spirit and the observer, NOT THE OBSERVED, NOR THOUGHTS.\nALL THE GENIUSES HAD THEIR EPIPHANIES/REVELATIONS DUE TO NOT THINKING BUT OBSERVANCE.\nTo love is a spiritual thing. To love oneself does not make any sense, except for being an egoic illusion: There you have the egoic splitting into two perceived identities. To love oneself is nonsense.\nThe observer can only love the observed which is not himself. Therefore when two people are together in Jesus name, meaning to be loving towards each other, then Jesus is present.\nThe Greek word Agape (love of ones neighbour) has two meanings: Love and God. God is love.\nWhen one understands ones true self instead of being trapped in form, under here thoughts, he is set free to love.\nIn fact the Bible tells that \u2026.\nONLY GODS CHILDREN CAN LOVE\nEgo can not love. A spirit who is trapped by following his own prison of compulsive thoughts (who he insists to be whom he is), is not capable of loving.\nYou may sense yourself as the observer, which liberates you from the egoic prison. Don't create a false illusory mind based self that you then decide to love. Accept who you really are: Your authentic self.\nThe pain You have suffered was due to entrapment in thought based egoic, controling concepts of whom you were. But that was in the past, an earlier present Now, which is no more.\nFreedom is here Now, and time is one of the thought based concepts that if believed, keep humans stuck in the perceived pain once experienced called \u201cpast\u201d, while fearing the \u201cfuture\u201d, yet another illusion of time.\nLove others AS IF they were you\nDo to others what you wish them to do to you\nTreat others as you want them to treat you\nAs jesus said about His disciples:\n\u201cFather/Abba, let them too be one with us as you and I are One.\u201d", "No. It is part of being abused.", "No. There is no such thing as \u2018split personality disorder\u2019.

In Narcissists, it is totally sub-conscious. Why? Because their developmental pathway turned into a direction that they live reality THROUGH confabulations.\nExample:\nI sometimes \u201clie\u201d. There is a friend of mine who asks me always to do a hobby with him, and I told him a lot of times I am not interested, yet he keeps asking me. After a point, I \u201clie\u201d that I need to do this and that so I can not do what he wants. Is this a lie? Well, it is, because my tasks are not of life-or-death importance, and when I get home I may choose to watch a movie instead. So, in practice, I COULD do that hobby with him, yet I don\u2019t. But I lie because he been unable to understand that I don\u2019t want to do it.\nThat is a lie in one situation, in order to get to a goal. Goal here, is: make him leave me alone.\nThis can be done in bigger things that could have big consequences.

Your lack of skills make you do a mistake that costs X amount of money to you or the company.\nAnd you can go up the level of bigger and bigger consequences, like, I have heard about a SURGEON who got exposed after not knowing how to properly clean hands before surgery (this is a specific process, not like when you or me wash hands).\nThat point, is, I believe, indication of a serious issue, personality disorder, etc..\nBut, Narcissism is even deeper. Even this fake surgeon can have a sane motivation, like he wants the money, and usually gets away with fake surgeries, others help him, he reads up online, etc\u2026 He is utterly irresponsible, and yes, the chase for money went into borderline psychosis, yet, wanting money is a sane motivation. Even if the way he wanted it is insane and utterly wrong.\nNarcissists don\u2019t lie to simply get to a goal.

He lies in order to avoid the Grandiosity Gap - when the abyss between fact and (narcissistic) fiction becomes too gaping to ignore. The narcissist lies in order to preserve appearances, uphold fantasies, support the tall (and impossible) tales of his False Self and extract Narcissistic Supply from unsuspecting sources, who are not yet on to him.

You realize that you only see the\u2019 images of the kitchen in your mind\u2019, and that you used to make a moving picture of it, but now you can\u2019t even construe that internally because you aren\u2019t in your mind anymore.\nNo one notices. You leave for work. You realize that nothing exists. Everything is \u2018images\u2019 in the mind. Existence was only a sort of \u2018significance\u2019 which you used to give things, but which you no longer can give. You don\u2019t move through the world but its more like the world moves around you. It\u2019s like you\u2019re sitting on a treadmill, always in the same spot, and the scenes of the world snake around you. Time also does this. It\u2019s always the same moment, and all the tommorrows and next weeks sort of come to you. And you realize that if moments can\u2019t change, like yours can\u2019t, then you could never get better. You are now a zombie! You feel half dead inside. Yet you could muster enough energy to scream in agony every now and then.\nWith depersonalization and derealization, there is only one comfort while you suffer it. There\u2019s only one goal in your day, and that is to feel as much pain as you possibly can. Because the pain is the closest you come to remembering that you\u2019re alive and human and not some psychopath. That and sleep. Sleep is good. But not \u2018falling asleep\u2019, no. This too is painful with dp. When you are fully asleep, then you are ok.\nIt passes though. And after the first two weeks, it gets significantly better. But while it lasts, those first two weeks anyway, man! I wouldn\u2019t wish that on my worst enemy. It\u2019s like as if you\u2019re crazy but completely sane. Like your mind has snapped, but you remain sane, trapped inside watching your broken mind perceive the world brokenly. Everything is a copy of things.

They are the product of a defective brain thus the product of a defective mind\" and \"schizophrenia is also the same. It's a mental illness\".\nElsewhere I commonly call these two thoughts the lie of mental illness. I know there's been many many research studies carried out to justify this lie us the truth. I do accept that there can be brain differences between, for example, those who are in pain and those who are not. I do believe it's quite possible that there can be brain differences and genetic differences that are more common in certain types of mental diversity. But these are differences not defecits or proof of a brain defect.\nThe lie of mental illness I also refer to as the biomedical model of mental illness and it's a lie. The truth is the biopsychosocial model but it is fundamental difference in paradigms and practices from what's built upon the lie of mental illness.\nLike skin colour is a biological difference but can be misrepresented as the product of an illness this is how I see the tragedies of suicidal individuals and schizophrenics and all the wide and natural parts of mental suffering and mental diversity who are victims of the tyranny of evil that is based on the lie of mental illness.\nWhat do you judge these thoughts as? For one thing I think these thoughts a lot on my own and I know what all the words mean to me but I might use terms and concepts in a way that might be hard for you to understand.\nNow add another element and that's my certainty that I'm right that...well it might not be classed as a lie in your mind but an evil misrepresentation of the truth to oppress and subjugate and basically justify tyranny is what the psychiatric and mental health system represents.\nBy my standards and beliefs it's a fool who has any certainty about the truth about mental suffering and mental diversity. There might be certain exceptions like the Dalai Lama but my certainty that I'm right about the biomedical model is a lie and certainty not the truth if I was judging my confidence that I'm right I'd judge myself as foolish.\nBut let me go further.\nConsider the thoughts classed as interpreting the evidence differently and coming to different conclusions. Just keep on judging me as you read this.\nWhat do I judge the minds to be of those who have for centuries had thoughts such as \"being suicidal is a mental illness\" or \"you're suicidal because there's something wrong with your brain or your mind or you\" or other thoughts based on the lie of mental illness. The schizophrenic mind because this is a delusion? No. The minds of monsters. Heartless and evil monsters.\nThe conditions and the prevail of nothing humane that's innate to human nature lead to the explanation of the lie of mental illness as the cause of suicidal suffering, feelings and thoughts. The human race are monsters and utterly heartless so they couldn't care about suicidal individuals without the lie that \"suicidal individuals are sick and you can't stigmatise the sick\" or \"they're not weak they're sick\".\nThere's absolutely nothing humane that's innate to human nature so mental suffering and mental suffering so extreme as suicidal suffering couldn't be understood by empathy. The human race are as heartless by nature as evil so in the conditions that prevailed before the invention of the institution of psychiatry suicidal individuals and other victims of psychiatry were extremely prejudiced against and faced horrific cruelties and evils based on the prejudices of the monsters who call themselves the human race. For example the ship of fools. All the schizophrenics in a town would be put on a ship - a ship in very bad condition so it didn't matter if it was sea worthy the ships used for the ship of fools - with a little food then pushed out to sea to drift until the food ran out or it reached another town where more schizophrenics were put on board and once again the ship was pushed out to sea to rid the towns of monsters of those deemed to be worthless. I'm not sure if this was done instead of outright murder because such murder was deemed to be wrong but Christian ethics and things like the double effect principle justified the ship of fools as not murder.\nFrom all this evil and cruelty that's innate to human nature were terrible conditions for those who are so prejudiced against. This were the conditions that led to the creation of the asylum system and those who suffered too much or were too different became housed in the asylum system then the caretakers of these asylums became doctors as the lie of mental illness was invented. (I haven't got all this bit written correctly or described correctly.)\nBut the monsters who call themselves the human race had no empathy for suicidal individuals back then. Their heartlessness was so profound. There's more factors in this that led to the creation of the lie of mental illness but I'm focusing on suicidal individuals not just because I am one but because it's the clearest example of the truth that there's nothing humane that's innate to human nature.\nBut the lie of mental illness is not a path to genuine empathy or what is actually care. Instead it's created the tyranny of evil that really does believe in using any cruelty and evil on the victims of psychiatry and it's all justified as care to do whatever evil and cruelty monsters want to do to the weak - the monsters call this the protection of the weak. The psychiatric profession justifies the use of the methods of punishment on suicidal individuals and this is the product of heartlessness so heartless that their sense of care is entrenched in the belief that there's absolutely no such thing as too cruel to do to a suicidal individual and this defines psychiatric care.\nAre you still judging me and my thoughts from the list at the top of this piece like I asked you to?\nI'm going to skip past a few more points that'll lead to the following points and thoughts.\nBecause there's nothing humane that's innate to human nature the lie of mental illness and the institution of psychiatry was invented. But there's nothing humane to the nature of the minds of doctors either.\nSo what prevails in the beginning of the new millennium is the freedom to inflict, prolong and worsen suicidality indefinitely.\nI am victim of being too different but this is not what is the point I'm making here.\nWhat I'm talking about is the minds of monsters and that's what defines the monsters who call themselves the human race.\nI face the will to make certain my suffering is unlimited and the cruelty that can be done to me is unlimited - this is called care for suicidal individuals. I've spent over a decade being suicidal and forced to suffer and endure against my will. In all this time I see the minds of monsters who would force me to live to protect their freedom to make a suicidal individual want to die.\nWhat I do and do not consent to is irrelevant to the minds of monsters...they take power over how I feel and never stop making me want to die and it's truly their pursuit of remaining free and evil that defines the sense of care of monsters for suicidal individuals from vast amounts of personal experience of the unlimited cruelty and evil the monsters who call themselves the human race want to do to a suicidal individual.\nMy suffering is there to be ignored even when I'm suicidal and again I have so much proof of this because I face the efforts of monsters. Because the sense of care of the monsters who call themselves the human race for suicidal individuals is the belief that suicidal individuals should expect to face unlimited cruelty and unlimited suffering. It's not just the criminalisation of assisted suicide that's the proof of this that defines human nature and what the monsters who call themselves the human race think is how the weak are meant to be protected.\nBut the monsters who call themselves the human race think they're good and humane and can care. Do you recognise this delusion is fundamental to the concept that there must be something wrong with suicidal individuals and our brains and our minds and that's why we're suicidal and this defines the laws that affect suicidal individuals and other victims of psychiatry.\nSo the delusion the monsters who call themselves the human race have leads to so much wholly unacceptable evil and cruelty done to suicidal individuals. The sense of care of monsters is the freedom to inflict prolong and worsen suicidality indefinitely and that's the basis of...of what. It's not the protection of the weak.\nBut if the monsters who call themselves the human race know the problem is the prevail of evil and cruelty in this civilisation of monsters and this evil defines their medical profession too - do you think this is the truth about why suicidal individuals become suicidal and stay suicidal?\nYou have your judgements about what's the schizophrenic mind and what's not. But what I recognise is the fundamental problem and it's the delusion the monsters who call themselves the human race need to believe they have anything humane that's innate to human nature.\nI face a sense of cruelty that thinks the proof of my suicidality is I'm here to be hurt and harmed endlessly. I face a sense of cruelty so sadistic I'm forced to live so the monsters who call themselves the human race have even more opportunities to make me want to die. A decade of so much effort to keep on making me want to die. And all the time it's because human nature is so sadistic that defines what the monsters who call themselves the human race do to me instead of killing me. Depriving me of rights and liberty and safety to perfect their complete betrayal of my humanity is the cruelty that's impossible but never impossible for a species of monsters born and bred evil who call themselves the human race.\nDo you recognise how I consider myself not part of the human race? I'm not like you. I'm not human. I'm not protected by empathy because I'm not someone to you.\nThey care about the freedom to inflict, prolong and worsen my suicidality indefinitely but they'll lie to themselves and say they are good and humane and can care.\nThey'll think things like \"you don't have to die\" but that's yet another delusion too like their beliefs that they are humane by nature instead of so heartless by nature they need the lie of mental illness to force a shred of compassion for suicidal individuals.\nHow do you judge my thoughts and my being? Do you see a mental illness like schizophrenia by my thoughts and your standards?\nNB\nI'm not talking about the disability schizophrenics suffer because of the prejudices and inequality.\nBut the medical profession has put so much effort into proving there's so much wrong with those labelled with psychosocial disabilities and they can't find anything good in the disabled.\nA question here is about the concept of psychiatry and that it proves there's nothing good about for example schizophrenics. So much effort has been put into using the scientific method to only seek to prove the bad about the schizophrenic type and schizophrenic traits. How do you classify the thoughts behind the purpose of a lot of psychiatric research? Unusual? A delusion? To seek to only prove the bad things about the schizophrenic mind and traits?\nDo I tar myself with the same brush or do I know what's wrong with unlimited suffering and that's what the monsters who call themselves the human race achieve instead of giving me access to assisted suicide?\nI face the successes of a species of monsters in making certain my suffering is unlimited and I know this is impossible but it's happening because there's no good in the human race and nothing humane that's innate to human nature and obviously I know I can't live in safety.

We have values, morals, ethics, thought processes, and a general idea on how things should go. For example, when I hit the gas pedal, I expect my car to move forward. I expect my favorite pizza joint to meet my hungry needs whenever I order from them. When physical experiences meet up with psychological experiences, there is comfort and peace (and pizza).\nImagine if one day you hit that gas pedal and nothing happens, how do you feel?\nIt feels off, doesn\u2019t it? Sort of like a panic, because now you are not sure whats going to happen next, and that is uncomfortable.\nThats a crude example of whats called cognitive dissonance where your perception of reality was not met with the actual experience of reality.\nI am going to guess by your question that you are having an experience with a human being, and that is where your gut feelings are arising the most. So when you hit the gas pedal on somebody, like ask a friend to hang out and they give you a half ass excuse, alarm bells fire, but why? Because the expected outcome was not in line with your perception.\nIn the context of narcissism, in a lovebomb stage, someone trains you that the gas pedal makes you go extremely fast. They mimic your every desire, every dream, respond to every emotional bid, and truly mirror everything you love, so you smash the hell out the gas pedal and go faster than you have ever been. Every button in the car does exactly what you\u2019d expect and then some.\nImagine waking up one day and finding suddenly that none of the buttons on the car work the way they did anymore. Not only that they dont work, but they hurt you. You hit the heat button, it blows cold, you hit the AC button, it blows heat. The gas pedal causes it to brake and the brake causes it to speed up. When you say something hurts you, instead of being met with empathy, they rage at you and blameshift, and project, and give silent treatments. So you try to do everything youve ever learned to fix the problem, you take the blame, you try again, but nothing works. You try to ignore them, they hoover you. You now have massive amounts of cognitive dissonance\nThats what a gut feeling is, it is a difference in what your perception and reality is. Your body knows it, your mind knows it, but they cant figure out which one is wrong, so if the dissonance is big enough, they will employ there own types of defense to fix it, aka denial, suppression, repression, projection, etcetera.

We are biopsychosocial creatures. Okay, okay now, I shall stop being repetitive.\nIf you are raised in an environment that values achievement, or you have parents who have struggled and put you down, you will have that external pressure. As we grow older, we adapt to our parent\u2019s style of disciplining to discipline ourselves. We tend to embrace the familiar, seeking comfort in it. (Yes, this even applies to negative things, like putting yourself down, because you are used to it) It should come as common sense that if you were raised where your parents depreciate you and such, you tend to be less confident, and self doubt more. Additionally, if you have friends who are insecure, value their appearance or have abilities that you envy, that might be a source as well. Maybe you\u2019ve heard that you are the product of the five people you hang out with? That\u2019s true. If you hang around social media addicts who Instagram their lives away as if they\u2019re in Keeping Up With the Kardashians, you\u2019re going to be self-conscious about how you look simply because that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been repeatedly exposed to. There are many others that I can name: loneliness out of being adopted, bullying and PTSD experiences, childhood and domestic abuse, etc.\nSecondly, if you have family members who may have suffered from psychological disorders, or you yourself have one, your genes play a big factor in your appearance of yourself. If you have siblings\u2014 especially identical siblings\u2014 your chances of replicating similar disabilities will almost quadruple.\nLastly, if you are a teenager, this would definitely apply. Adolescence is a challenging time. You peak, and flock. Your hormones start surging, puberty starts. Humans all have the innate need to belong. If that is being denied whether through your environment or your own biological genes, you will start depreciating yourself. You can work your way up to self-actualization once you have satisfied your basic and demanding needs.\nOnce you have fulfilled most esteem goals, your self-doubt will slowly diminish as you work your way to self-actualization.\nAll in all, there\u2019s really no \u201cright\u201d answer to your question, \u2018where does self-doubt originate? \u2018 There\u2019s obviously going to be many, many other factors that no one has had yet to consider\u2014 or have discovered. Just remember that like everyone else out there, it is normal to doubt yourself. You wouldn\u2019t be human if you didn\u2019t. Don\u2019t doubt yourself if you\u2019re comparing yourself to someone else, because although cliche, you NEVER know what is going on with anyone else except yourself.

Their mother has terrible anger issues, and spend a lot of time screaming at them. She also calls them names, guilt trips them constantly, and is generally very controlling. She does not \u201craise\u201d her children, as she teaches no values or principles, has no rules or consequences (except the above mentioned methods of abuse). She babies them, and try to keep them as dependent she can, for example by wiping them in the bathroom until the age of 7, washing them (including genitals), sleeps in bed with them, overreacts by magnifying the situation and overwhelmingly comforts at anything that scares them etc. She has also locked the 8 year old out of the house on several occasions, or locked them in their rooms \u201cto be ashamed\u201d.\nThe 13 year old never speaks her mind, or expresses her emotions, the 8 year old is terribly dependent and scared of everything.

Bound to lose sometimes.\u201d How long would our luck hold out? Besides battling Charlie, we had snakes, centipedes, scorpions, peeves, hordes of ants, and the \u2018wait a minute\u2019 vines that would pull a tank crewman out of his hatch. Maybe, just maybe witnessing the following caused the trauma.\nREPOSTED FROM EARLIER ANSWER.\nFor a combat soldier, you experience and see things that no 18 or 19 year old boy should experience or see. And they have to carry this weighty baggage with them for the rest of their lives. Civilians, other than first responders who have to see these horrors their whole careers instead of a couple of tours like us, would not see things that we saw in their worst nightmare. Soldiers have been through traumatic events in every war, not just Vietnam. But they are trained to go through and see that shit and get through it and survive , hopefully. Why? Because they are sent to shitholes the world over by their government, so, as a good soldier they go.\nAs a tank crewman in the Armored Cavalry in Vietnam we saw a lot of action. A lot. But it was our job to head into the shit and get it done. That\u2019s what we were paid for. That\u2019s what the 11th. ACR was known for. And we did have pride in that, we had pride in that rearing black horse on our shoulder patch.\nI\u2019m not going to gloss anything over here so be forewarned. It\u2019s not easy to stir up these nightmare visions hiding in the corners of my mind but everytime a question like this comes up, I have to awaken them. These are just some of the things I saw as a tank crewman in Vietnam.\nWhile towing a tank out of the muck it was bogged down in, the steel cable snapped and whipped into a soldier standing a little too close. They were warned to stay back. The cable tore into him and cut him cleanly in half like someone took a huge meat cleaver and sliced. His arms were still moving and head thrashing from side to side. Then he was still.\nMoving up into combat an RPG hit the tank commander in the tank ahead of us. It tore his head off. I watched as the gunner and loader crawled out of the hatches, pulled his headless body out, laid it on the back deck of the tank then crawled back into the hatches to get back to work. The gunner took over as the TC. The driver just kept driving through it all. That was his job.\nWhile advancing on a troop support mission in Long Khanh Province, we were hit with RPG and mortar fire. I saw a grunt who started running just to the front and right of our tank suddenly enveloped in an explosion. I soon saw he had been torn in half. What I will never forget is that he started dragging himself along the ground with his elbows. No legs, just his torso. He fell after crawling about five or six feet. Someone\u2019s son had just died horribly. What was going through his mind? I had to steer left a little to not run over his separated legs. You see all this shit as you\u2019re driving the tank and there is nothing you can do but keep driving. It\u2019s hard.\nI saw the ACAV my close friend was driving explode in a fireball after getting hit by an RPG. There were no survivors. We each gave each other a fist pump and smile before heading out.\nI\u2019ve seen crewmen bailing out of burning ACAV, M113, on fire themselves.\nI\u2019ve told a badly wounded young soldier who was gasping and trying to reach out to me as I laid him on our tank deck not to worry, to hold on because we would get him back to safety. He died as I was talking to him. Red headed young fellow. Frightened eyes.\nThe average Vietnam combat soldier saw combat far more than his WWII counterpart. Far more. We in the 11th. ACR were nearly always in the field. Why? We had the big M48A3 tank. The M48 could handle the RPGs and the road mines, the Sheridan\u2019s could not. We were forever doing Thunder Runs down those highways. Hitting a mine is one of the most bone jarring, teeth rattling concussive thing that could happen to you, especially the driver whose closest to the ground. The C4 filled burlap bags rarely killed an M48 crewman but it sure tore a track apart and shattered road wheels.\nAnd you ask me what was so PTSD inducing that happened to US soldiers in Vietnam?\nWe few, that saw and had been through these traumatic war sites and experiences and then went home, if we were lucky to get home and didn\u2019t end up lying under a poncho in the rain in a God forsaken jungle, to try and live normal lives, get jobs and raise families and contend with flashes of these horrors appearing every so often from triggers. Fireworks, loud noises, the smell of diesel fumes, a helicopter flying over. And dreams that would make you bolt up in the middle of the night soaked in sweat.\nWell we did it.\nMost of us, I say most of us did okay.", "Whereas World War II was both a war for territory and an existential war for democracy and human values, the Vietnam War quickly evolved into a war of attrition (Perret, 1990). With no clear aim of holding territory, the war was bereft of the traditional measures of success in military conflict. Officers were instead encouraged to maximize enemy casualties. Gen. William C. Westmoreland, head of the US forces in Vietnam during the heaviest engagements of the war, commented; \u201cStatistics were, admittedly, an imperfect gauge of progress, yet in the absence of conventional frontlines, how else to measure it?\u201d on the use of \u201cbody count\u201d as an indicator of mission success (Gartner & Myers, 1995).\nAnother characteristic of this conflict was the fierce fighting between U.S. troops and civilians engaged in organized guerrilla warfare. This put the non-combatant status of civilians into question. Such elements, along with other factors, served to generate a particular set of war zone stressors for soldiers serving in the Vietnam War. Unfortunately, these were not always in line with the established concepts of trauma (Laufer, Gallops, & Frey-Wouters, 1984). Incidents such as witnessing or participating in abusive violence, i.e., torturing prisoners, mutilating enemy bodies, or raping or killing civilians, did not necessarily involve any threat to the soldiers\u2019 life, and would often not be regarded as traumatic stressors according to the trauma-understanding of the time (Breslau & Davis, 1987). However, subsequent studies found that decades after the war as many as 30.9% of Vietnam veterans suffered from war related mental health issues (Dohrenwend et al., 2006).", "Post-traumatic Stress Disorder is the brain\u2019s reaction to situations/events which are terrifying, stressful, dangerous and for which the individual has no experience, such as a sexual assault, horrendous vehicle accident, being taken hostage, natural or man made disaster or the horrors of combat. (An example would be witnessing or attempting to assist others at \u201c\u201cground zero\u201d on 9/11/2001). A person can develop PTSD from experiencing such traumas or witnessing them. The disorder or condition has existed from time immemorial, but was only recognized fairly recently. (For a list of symptoms, please \u201cGoogle\u201d the subject.)\nWhile PTSD is common among rape victims, first responders (firefighters, police, Emergency Medical Technicians, hospital Emergency Room personnel and others exposed to horrendous trauma, soldiers (and civilians living in active combat areas) develop more deep-seated symptoms because of their exposure to such trauma over extended periods of time. It is not a new phenomenon, and did not originate during the Vietnam war.\nDuring World War I (1914\u20131918), these symptoms were called \u201cshell shock\u201d because individuals often endured weeks of continuous artillery bombardment. In WWII (1939\u20131945) it was termed \u201c\u201cbattle fatigue\u201d, and was often considered cowardice or malingering. The fact that PTSD can be effectively managed is a very recent development.\nThere appear to be more Vietnam veterans affected because we now identify these symptoms as a treatable condition (I hesitate to call it a \u201cdisease\u201d, although the American Psychiatric Association lists it among mental disorders). The millions who suffered following wars and other disasters were mainly ignored in the past, or treated as miscreants or \u201c\u201cmental cases\u201d.\nMy professional experience as a Licensed Professional Counselor in acute hospital situations leads me to believe that victims of sexual assault suffer from PTSD as much as combat soldiers, but they tend to \u201c\u201csuffer in silence\u201d. Medical and rescue professionals often suffer from PTSD after \u201closing\u201d a patient.\nPTSD can be successfully treated using a variety of cognitive/behavioral therapies, and can be reduced by immediate \u201cdebriefing\u201d conducted by mental health professionals.", "There are certain things one should not do or witness. I was raised as a good young man, Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, involved in every sport through high school (working with a team and sportsmanship), a mother that preached honesty and hard work and to always treat people the way you\u2019d want them to treat you. Now take that kid and place his in a combat situation where there were no rules and everything was fair game to enhance ones ability to survive.\nIt\u2019s true that not all of the troops in a war see the real effect of a battle. There are 10 soldiers in the rear that support one soldier in the fight. So it\u2019s a 1\u201310 ratio. For a war that lasted 10 years the number affected is rather large. Growing up as an Army Brat, all of my friends had the same problem with their fathers that served in WWII. They drank every night to forget what they encountered during the war; including my father. They suffered from PTSD back then but it wasn't diagnosed as a problem. Back then the men and women in the Army were to embrace the suck and drive on. It\u2019s just not that easy.\nI saw so much devastation and the ugly side of war. Friends getting killed, coming within minutes of being killed, seeing enemy dead left to rot (spent two weeks holding a hill Nui Khet (Nui-mountain) against a NVA counter attack to retake the hill, which never happened. The Cambodian soldiers and the one Green Beret that were KIA were removed but the large number of the NVA were left wher they fell. (BTW the one Green Beret that was KIA was awarded the MOH-SGT Buker-for his actions in taking the hill.

I emailed my sons teacher to tell her what he\u2019d said (taken with a grain of salt, because preschoolers) and she told me they were aware of the behavior, my son was not the only target, and were dealing with it with the family. As someone who works with kids, my first instinct is abuse or other mistreatment at home, but I have no idea if that\u2019s the case. Either way, does this sound like a happy child? One who relishes in picking on my son (both the largest and youngest in the class, which makes him an easy target) and others is clearly unhappy himself, right?\nThis is what I tell my children: people hurt others because they are themselves hurting.

W is clearly unhappy and struggling big time with his preschool emotions, he doesn\u2019t actually hate my son. In fact, the teacher said my son is always happy and surrounded by friends.

It was presented by the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika as being a basic part of the Buddha\u2019s teachings. The present day Theravada hold to the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika pesentation of the Abhidharma, including its listing of the factors of mind, known as dharmas. Hence, we would be justified in taking this as a psychological text\nBut dissention arose from many quarters. The Heart Sutra, for instance, directly negates the Abhidharma teachings via its emblematic intermediary, Sariputra, through the teachings that all dharmas are of the nature of emptiness. Hence the apparent psychological studies that make up the Abhidharma are shown to be a philosophical misconception of the Buddha\u2019s teachings as the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 sutras put forth. This view is especially taken up by the Madhyamaka school started by Nag\u0101rjuna\nAnother quarter (the Sautr\u0101ntika) disagree with the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika in that the dharmas (which are the basic building blocks of a sentient being) are radically impermanent. Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika do not agree, granting dharmas (mental phenomena) duration. The Sautr\u0101ntika use for their Abhidharma the Abhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya of Vasubandhu. This becomes a great point of distinction between these two philosophical schools\nAnd lastly, the Citt\u0101matra, or Mind-only school, as begun by Asa\u1e45ga, shows that if indeed all dharmas are momentary, as the Sautr\u0101ntika suggest, then it isn\u2019t necessary to even have an external world since they are momentary series of mind only. The Mind-only does not suggest that there is no external world. Rather, that what we know of it is of mind only. In addition to its own abhidharma, it contains a rich diversity of philosophical expressions\nThis philosophical view completes the fourth of the four philosophical tenet systems of Buddhism.

The underlying cause of the problem was that of emotional feelings of being unworthy as well as a couple of other underlying negative emotions. I was able to release that with a technique that I had been using with my clients for the previous 8 months before I learned how to do this for myself for my particular issue. The answer came when I learned what needed to be released and that isn\u2019t something the trainers are going to teach people who have no understanding of mental health issues. Once that was done, the bipolar was gone! That was back in February 2014.

Our emotions are integrated with our thoughts and these need to be dealt with in a manner that works - not just endlessly talking about the same old crap which goes absolutely nowhere.

That ideologue might perceived their needs in a very different way than other people perceive. His/her identity might seem much more real than \u201dthis transient life.\u201d\nIn a word, I\u2019m not sure the medical model of mental illness always sees that various thought emergences might be less strange than the fact that thoughts exist at all. People have various needs.\nI think the medical model is still integrating some basic points\u2014like \u201cpeople heal themselves.\u201d Medicine helps and removes blocks. But mental illnesses can be a healing process. \u2018Keep the benzodiazepines on hand\u2014-for sure\u2014but don\u2019t kill every challenging process.\u2019", "What are your views concerning the medical model of mental illness?\nFirst, any reference to \u2018mental\u2019 illness simply describes the location of the illness. In other words, \u2018mental\u2019 differentiates the illness from pulmonary, cardiac or renal disease, to use three examples.\nSecond, all mental disease (illness) is of physical origin. In other words, there is no valid difference between mental illness and physical illness. It is all physical. This is an extremely important point often missed by many. Health Insurance companies, for example, are prone to distinguish mental from physical illness. This error is serious enough to qualify as fraud when it comes down to denial of coverage.\nBottom line: The brain is a physical organ, just like the lungs, heart and kidneys. The governance of behavior is only one of it\u2019s critical functions as the central processing unit of the body, and it must be understood that many other illnesses involving other organ systems also adversely effect brain function. Everything is connected and interactive. The biomedical model of illness, be it mental, renal, cardiac, pulmonary, endocrine, gastrointestinal, etc. is the only valid window through which we can view behavioral abnormalities. That does not mean that all behavioral abnormalities require medications for successful treatment.\nNote: It is the medical community that defines the criteria for specific medical diagnoses. There are those physicians (typically psychiatrists) out there who wrongly diagnose persons, typically committed Christians, as schizophrenic because they describe the ability to hear or discern the voice or will of God. This grave error is induced by cultural antichristian bias and arrogant, elitist thinking. Some countries use this logic to assign people stints in reeducation camps, psychiatric intervention - or worse."], "topic_list": ["Mental Health Advocacy", "Mental Health Stigma", "Clinical Psychology", "Psychiatry", "Understanding and Improving Mental Health", "Mental Illness", "Psychology", "Mental Health", "Health", "Medicine and Healthcare", "Survey Question"], "view_list": [199, 192, 184, 181, 191], "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "no_of_follower": 2, "question_author": "Andie Speziale", "upvote_list": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], "question_title": "What are your views concerning the medical model of mental illness?", "respond_collected": 5, "no_of_view": "1,644", "name_list": ["Suzanne Kellner-Zinck", "Frankie Frontis", "Piet Bakx", "Simon Zak", "Bill Reid"], "date_list": ["Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"]}, "506": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Neurotransmitters", "Mental Illness", "Neuroscience", "Psychology", "Mental Health"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "no_of_follower": 2, "question_author": "Malik Nouman", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "What is the relationship between psychological and neurotransmitter disorders?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "218", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "462": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Hive Mind", "Hives (medication condition)", "Bees (insect)", "Entomology", "Insects", "The Mind", "Human Brain", "Philosophy", "Neuroscience", "Psychology", "Biology"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 2, "question_author": "Gavin Jackson", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "What are some key differences between a \u201chive mind\u201d and the \u201cChina brain\u201d?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "244", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "49": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Jean Piaget", "Psychology", "Mental Health"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Catherine Doucer", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "What is mental representation Piaget?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "194", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "510": {"ans_list": ["I don\u2019t know what is normal but i have the same problem as you.

Affected children have difficulty forming emotional attachments to others, show a decreased ability to experience positive emotion, cannot seek or accept most forms of closeness, and may react violently when held, cuddled, or comforted.\nBehaviorally, affected children are unpredictable, difficult to console, and difficult to discipline. They have demolished self esteem and suffer from feelings of worthlessness. The traumatic situations which lead to RAD create a persistent state of anxiety & stress (in contrast to sociopaths, who have numbed fear responses); diminishing their capacity for resilience. They may seem to live in a perpetual state of paranoid \u201cflight, fight, or freeze\u201d mode & perpetually believe others will harm them if given half a chance, and are unable to trust anyone.\nThey have inner feelings of emptiness & loneliness, and at some level deeply crave love and to be loved, but are too paranoid of being betrayed and hurt again to properly accept love or affection at this point. Relationships with someone with RAD are extremely volatile due to this inner conflict, are almost invariably psychologically abusive, and may be physically abusive. Most have a strong desire to control their environment and others around them. Attempts to control them or unsolicited comfort may elicit rage, violence, destructive behavior, &/or self destructive behavior.\nThey experience very minimal affective empathy (i.e. compassion) for others and those with Inhibited RAD have very poorly developed social skills. In the classroom, these challenges lead to those with Inhibited RAD to frequently experience social rejection & becoming ostracized from teachers and peers alike. Inhibited RAD causes autistic-level poor social skills. Medical professionals often originally mistake it for Asperger\u2019s Syndrome/High Functioning Autism until a ruling out of this takes place. They are very socially isolated and generally have no friends. Those with Inhibited RAD are also highly touch averse. They are more likely than most to be asexual - however, asexuality is certainly NOT guaranteed, and many have desires that are extremely difficult to act upon due to their extreme discomfort with touch. Exceptions to this touch aversion typically revolve around situations where they feel safe & in control. This may be being okay with touching a single person they know very well, okay only if THEY initiate the physical contact...or more twisted scenarios such as okay with physical contact only if their partner is tied up or unable to resist. Those with Inhibited RAD typically have an extremely flat, unchanging expression. It may not change even if a pwInhibited RAD is feeling something. (ex: amused & only expressing a small facial twitch to show it)\nThose with Disinhibited RAD (i.e. Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder) have great social skills and numerous CASUAL, SUPERFICIAL friendships. They do not allow anyone to get closer to them than the surface level. In stark contrast to the touch averse Inhibited pwRAD, Disinhibited RADs are hyper affectionate with even strangers, and are very typically sexually promiscuous when they get older. They are attempting to achieve the intimacy they crave without the threat of having to bond emotionally with anyone & be vulnerable. As children, they attempt to wander off with strangers and essentially \u201creplace\u201d their parents with random people they find repeatedly. While they also have blunted internal emotions, those with Disinhibited RAD FAKE having the full range of emotions.\nAs they approach adolescence and adulthood, RAD children are more likely than their neurotypical (NT) peers to have involvement with the legal system and experience incarceration.\nInhibited RAD behavior which is often descibed as sociopathic. It can include animal cruelty, purposefully starting fires, physical violence &/or physical abuse, large scale theft, & other types of criminal behavior. They typically do NOT care enough to keep a spotless reputation, and typically are known to be \u201cbad\u201d & \u201cdangerous.\u201d However, their crimes are more planned & calculated and much less impulsive than the crimes of most sociopaths (due to their paranoia vs. sociopaths' numbed fear responses). They care deeply about not getting caught, and can plan meticulously & in advance.\nDisinhibited RAD causes a lot of graphic antisocial thoughts & urges as well. HOWEVER, due to caring DEEPLY about their reputations, Disinhibited pwRAD typically do not act on these urges in any way that would be illegal or make them look bad. Antisocial behavior is typically covert manipulation, emotional cruelty, &/or covert vindictiveness.\nRAD can cause explosions of rage, as well as pathological lying and manipulative behavior.\nRAD forms when a child forms ZERO emotional attachment to ANY caregiver. Given children without certain neurological anomalies (ex: Psychopathy) yearn for and are meant to form emotional bonds with their caregivers, not bonding is both extremely traumatic in and of itself, AND can only be caused by severe trauma.\nRAD forms at <5 years old, and some say as young as <2 years old.\nPotential Causes (AT LESS THAN 5 YEARS OLD):\n(i) Absence of a single, long-term primary caregiver - This might arise in cases where the child is moved repeatedly from one foster care situation to another. It also can occur in orphanages or in institutions where the caregiver-to-child ratio is high. The child does not get the benefit of having a primary caregiver who is focused on their needs, and so they do not have the opportunity to form important attachment bonds.\n(ii) An inattentive primary caregiver - The caregiver is present but is consistently unresponsive to the child's needs. The child may, for instance, have to endure long periods of being hungry or needing a soiled diaper changed before they are attended to. Caregiver inattentiveness also includes situations where the child is not played with, or there is very little eye contact, physical contact, or shared emotions (such as smiling) even when the caregiver is close by.\n(iii) Separation from a primary caregiver - This can include the death of one or both parents, as well as situations in which the parent is incarcerated or relocates without the child, and no stable caregiver remains.\n(iv) Excessive early physical or sexual abuse by primary caregiver(s) - The experience can erode the child's trust in having someone who will protect them from harm, and can obviously cause a child not to bond with their abuser(s). The child may begin to view the world as an unsafe place in which they need to be on their guard at all times.\n(v) Parental substance abuse - Alcohol and drug abuse can take away from a parent's ability to focus on and cater to the child's needs.\n(vi) Parental mental health issues - Parental mental health issues, particularly if untreated or undiagnosed, can impede the parent's ability to cater to the needs of the child adequately.\n(vii) Prolonged hospitalization - A child who is hospitalized for a long period may have grossly insufficient contact with a parent or other primary caregiver. The child is, therefore, unable to bond successfully with them.\nResources to Learn About RAD:\nReactive Attachment Disorder Diagnosis in Adults\n\nReactive Attachment Disorder - DSM5 code 313.89\n\nWhat Are Attachment Issues In Children, And How Are They Treated?\n\nKids Who Are Too Friendly With Strangers May Have This Disorder\n\nSigns & Causes of Reactive Attachment Disorder | Resource Treatment Center"], "topic_list": ["Attachment Theory", "Reactive Attachment Disorder", "Attachment", "Abnormal Psychology", "Psychiatry", "Personality Disorders", "Understanding and Improving Mental Health", "Mental Illness", "Psychology", "Mental Health"], "view_list": [417], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 3, "question_author": "Wayne Hardy", "upvote_list": [0], "question_title": "What is reactive attachment disorder and what are the main contributing factors to this disorder?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "681", "name_list": ["Emma Smith"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020"]}, "571": {"ans_list": ["Paper checks only just started going out on April 24.

The state has been known to use sleight of hand (to manipulate the perceptions of the people or distract them from something much more important).\nMost people are grossly misinformed about what a \u201ccult of personality\u201d itself is. The common myth is that it is a form of power abuse or undue influence. That the \u201cleader\u201d of a cult of personality has his followers under a spell somehow. This gives rise to many concerned questions on Quora about \u201ccults of personality\u201d. But they\u2019re a complete misdirection.\nThere is no spell, nor abuse, nor undue influence. A \u201ccult of personality\u201d is simply fame. All famous people have cults of personality. There is nothing abusive about it. Possibly annoying, but not abusive.\nFollowers of famous people are not under a spell. The follower has the power. The \u201cleader\u201d has to cater to them, or lose them. There is no abuse. The follower could easily choose to stop following, thus terminating the dynamic.\nTheir tendency to keep watching could be an addiction, but if you are addicted, that is merely mental frivolity or indiscipline, not someone abusing you. You have the power to control your own mind, and choose mental discipline. Few people may exercise that power, but you have it nonetheless. All you have to do is choose it.\nCults of personality are entirely unrelated to cult organizations. One is merely fame, and the other is a gross abuse of power. The leader of a cult organization exerts abusive power over his followers.

The first guy I saw was a behaviorist, and I do not exaggerate when I say he changed my life. Then he graduated. The next year the woman I was assigned was a Freudian. Back then I did not know how bad a match that was. I would go to sessions and she would encourage me to talk, but never said anything other than \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d The thing is, I am a very open person, and had no issue talking about my feelings\u2014that is my default setting\u2014 so the prompt was unnecessary, even silly.

MBTI uses Fe perspective, so its more of generalization instead of defining people individually. It is about \u201dgeneral traits\u201d of humans. Like it or not, there are people who are similar to you and me.\nBefore I knew MBTI, I didn't understand myself. Like, people were interested in talking about the new movies, celebs, sports, politics, the new fashion trends, etc but I just wasn't interested in those things. I was more interested in \u201cflora and fauna\u201d, plants and animals, in essence, I was interested in life and what makes up a living being. But nobody would talk with me about these things. However, what's horrible is the fact that I seemed to attract people to be curious about me, so I always had a few friends around. Well, actually, not a few. But plenty. I was always interested in logical thinking and debates. I was always an argumentative individual. My grandmother initially dotted on me for my \u201csmart\u201d arguments everytime, but then as I grew older we grew apart because it became apparent to her that I'm very aloof and distant.and she never liked it. She's a extrovert. When she was younger, there's always gathering in her house every week, and I couldn't stand it and I just stopped going there for years. Even during normal days, there would always be people around, and my distance made her dislike me even more.\nAlso, I used to wonder. My ESFJ and INFJ bffs could easily pick up on people's emotions, I could never do that. In fact, I found it very weird. But according to them I'm insensitive. Like, they'd easily cry with those who cry. I can't do it. And I can't act either (hence the INTP being chameleon isn't applicable to me). They also have no problem entertaining guests, like laughing with them, hugging them, or whatever. I was known to be very sarcastic and insensitive among my peers. First time a friend told me her impression about me, I was surprised. I thought I was being normal, but according to them I was \u201crude and insensitive\u201d and they wished me to be nicer.\nUntil I discovered MBTI and everything made sense. Everytime I read about my type, when its accurately written, I can't help but laugh outloud\nE.g., this one:\nINTPs, on the other hand, have a very unconscious relationship with their Feeling process and a much higher threshold for tuning it out. Once it gets triggered, though, it\u2019s anything but quiet. For a generally rational and straight-faced INTP, a sudden Fe burst of emotion can look like a full on temper tantrum. Uncontrollable crying isn\u2019t just a possibility, it\u2019s a probability. And the INTP \u2013 having no clue what the hell is happening to them \u2013 is swept up in the ride. An INFP will rarely temper tantrum. They may get angry, though this will generally be a controlled internalized version of the emotion. When an INTP gets angry, it\u2019s more like a powder keg of explosion. For short, the Fe of INTPs is generally repressed, but once it gets triggered it's much more \"explosive\" than the Fi of INFPs.\nDoes MBTI help me to understand others?\nYes, definitely. I now understand why people are the way they are. They are just doing things based on how they're wired.\nBut to actually \u201cunderstand\u201d in the sense that, am I able to tolerate certain things people do that get on my nerves? Tbh, no. As per usual, understanding principles is easy peasy, but to apply my knowledge is another story.\nTo this day I still struggle big time when it comes to talk to sensors, introverted feelers, extroverted thinkers. Introverted feelers being my main struggle and the source of my endless stress. Somehow I and them just don't pick each other's signals and how sensitive they can be. I mean, I'm really weak in the feeling department, can't you just excuse me?

I\u2019m the only one of me. And Myers Briggs can\u2019t account for that. It certainly can\u2019t account for you or others.\nIt can only generalize.\nIs it useful?

I call it Attachment Trauma.\nBPD clients present \u2014in different degrees\u2014 fear of abandonment, unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, clear emotional dependence and codependence, neediness, and they are most of the time looking for someone that takes care of them. That\u2019s obviously related to the failure they suffered to connect with their caregiver.\nThe theory says that the mothers of BPD people fail in passing on to their babies the regulation skills that every nervous system needs in order to function adequately and regulate emotions. BPD people suffer from affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood like hyper-vigilance, irritability, anxiety, depression, obsessiveness, impulsivity, rage, paranoia, etc., that are clear signs of dysregulation of the nervous system.\nBabies learn to regulate trough their mothers, but when a mother doesn\u2019t have the capacity to regulate herself, she can\u2019t regulate the baby, and the emotional attunement and attachment don\u2019t happen.\nBasically all people that suffer from BPD present disorganized attachment patterns. Disorganized attachment can be understood in terms of an approach-avoidance dilemma for infants for whom stressed or traumatized/traumatizing caregivers are simultaneously a source of threat and security. That\u2019s why BPD people tend to think in black & white terms, seeing the partner as the best or the worst.", "I was told that I\u2019m sensitive so when I was constantly emotionally invalidated in a chaotic family environment, I lost or the ability to regulate my emotions was deferred. I was incarcerated from age 17- up until recently and I think I developed my fear of abandonment more in prison and other issues.\nMy dad who was the main emotionally invalidating person, was also someone I wanted by my side while incarcerated. We didn\u2019t really get along and he only saw me once all those years. My mom however was always there for me but she also has not ever been able to understand me and that once made me tell her my 3rd year in that I don\u2019t miss her and I thinks it\u2019s best if we just don\u2019t talk until I paroled because I\u2019ll just bring her down.", "One theory I prefer is that Borderline Personality Disorder is a serious mental illness which does not come from trauma as its etiology, but which is an endogenous condition which can be triggered by an emotional trauma. Many BPD persons who make it to any depth of counseling report that they \u2018felt different\u2019 for years and years with a sense of being uncertain about being loved, wanted and belonging. Reports of this having begun in grade school are common for those who are inquired on that possibility. All kids feel this, but the BPD processes it differently with deeper hurt and uncertainty. BPD persons process nearly everything differently. Their world is one of reality distortion and emotional dysregulation of years. Many suffer in silence and parents don\u2019t have a clue.\nA traumatic event, then, can be something we all endure universally and, with parental help, usually process it and work through it. Death of a beloved pet seems to be common. As children grow up, they encounter different experiences, such as caring for a pet when parents feel they are old enough, and these expose the child to those kinds of universal experiences, some of which can be traumatic - more so than more resilient kids.\nAge of onset has belled in around age 25, but this central distribution consistency on age suggests that the condition has been within the child for a decade or more. This makes their history very important to their clinical picture. BPD isn\u2019t something which just happens from an event, but has been lurking for years waiting for such an event.\nThis can explain the term borderline. It is a medical term quite common throughout principles and practice. A patient can have borderline hypertension, borderline obesity, borderline tryglyceridemia and you have heard of borderline diabetes. A lot of things are borderline which means that they have been an ongoing degenerative disease which eventually gets to the point where it is going to come into bloom. Welp, mental disease is not that far from physical disease. Never has been.\nI say this because knowing that one has a disease is far better than going through life feeling one is rejected and unloved. The word I have for that is Hope.\nWhen one has something which is borderline anything, there is the optimism that it can be made to go the other direction. Borderline means that it is hovering near the demarcation between, for instance, a blood pressure of a normal 120/80 and a hypertension of 150/90. In that condition, one is said to have borderline hypertension.\nMove that trend enough and quality of life can improve greatly.", "I\u2019m not quite sure on the specifics since I haven\u2019t been trained on it. But I was sexually abused at the age of 2 for I don\u2019t know how long since I don\u2019t remember it. I was put in therapy right after. At first professionals thought that the sexual abuse then was the root of my issues. Then I eventually told my parents how I had been sexually abused by my cousin from the age of 6\u201312. Me finally telling someone then got me, my parents, and my sisters disowned by my grandma and my aunt. I was extremely close to my grandma.\nI had seen a psychologist when I was 13 or 14 and she said that my intelligence was the level of basically a college student but my emotional intelligence was that of a 7 year old.\nThe general consensus by the time I was 16 was that the initial trauma started the downward spiral and the abusive from my cousin just kind of finished it.

It\u2019s any question you ask whose answer seems obvious to the other(s). It puts them off their guard - are you kidding? Your question shows there\u2019s something fundamental that you haven\u2019t grasped, which to them is so plain anyone would know it. They laugh from surprise. They wouldn\u2019t have expected the question from anyone (much less you). When you\u2019re sensitive over being laughed at, and especially if to you it was an innocent and sensible question, you may be hurt by the response.\nHow I got over that is threefold. One, I recognized that they really were surprised by the question. That means they didn\u2019t expect me not to know that. They\u2019d \u201cthought better of me,\u201d you could say - cue more hurt over disappointing their expectation perhaps, but bear in mind with it that the general expectation I create is of someone fairly intelligent. They would be much less surprised otherwise, and might not even laugh at the person who asked, if that person is someone they\u2019ve grown to expect doesn\u2019t understand things.\nTwo, I recognized that zings and japes are commonly affectionate gestures. It isn\u2019t necessarily done to be mean. It\u2019s more a general, opportunistic thing people do when they have a chance to get a shot in, because they don\u2019t usually. If you\u2019re not a zinging japer yourself, they often don\u2019t notice that because most of their friends are. For them, making fun is just part of treating you like a friend.\nThird, after thinking about it quite a bit, I decided I never minded being the cause of amusement. If I can make others feel good, I like it. It costs me nothing, really (once it stopped bothering me, it really did cost me nothing). It\u2019s fun for me, because I\u2019d rather ask those questions and not worry about being made fun of. I\u2019m asking for a reason: it\u2019s something I don\u2019t know, and I want to find out. I don\u2019t mind them finding out I don\u2019t know. If they do know, I won\u2019t clam up just because they find out I don\u2019t. I\u2019m going to ask another question, and understand.\nI\u2019m pretty smart, but I\u2019m also pretty oblivious to a lot of things. I\u2019ve had some pretty shocking gaps in my grasp over the years. Things which afterwards, I was chagrined to realize yes, in hindsight everyone does know this. How did I miss it? It even came to seem funny to me, because how absurd. How could I go my whole life and not tweak to this? Yet after the initial laughter, I asked followup questions about how it all fit together, and as we went deeper in they saw I had the grasp of it quickly, and took it places they hadn\u2019t thought to go themselves.\nThe point is: you can\u2019t get past this by avoiding certain kinds of questions. You can\u2019t identify in advance which questions these will be. Because you don\u2019t know. You didn\u2019t even realize there was something to know there, probably. Suddenly it jumps out at you, and you ask. The only way to avoid this would be to generally avoid asking questions. When you don\u2019t know a thing, it\u2019s impossible for you to gauge whether it\u2019s something other people think everyone knows.\nIf you decided to stop asking questions where you don\u2019t know, you\u2019d only stunt yourself and remain ignorant. You\u2019d let your curiosity be choked out by fear of your ignorance being exposed. Yet ignorance is blameless so long as it remains curious. Ignorance is no shame unless it is chosen. To turn away from wanting to know is to choose ignorance. Ignorance unchosen is only innocence.\nKeep asking.

However when the person realizes that the information is only perceived hateful suggestions, then they can get a handle on and overcome the problem.\nThe victim is persuaded, unbeknown to them, by underhanded foul game play. see my first video in my pinned answer: Kyrani Eade's answer to Does the distinction drawn by doctors between \"organic illnesses\" and psychiatric illness play into the old stereotype that psychiatric illness isn't genuine? What would be less pejorative terminology?\nAnd this is done by related, inhumane people with some agenda. Narcissistic supply, i.e., getting pleasure from seeing the other person\u2019s suffering is always on the agenda, no matter what else.\nFurthermore ideas about the government doing this is a very good cover for the offenders. Furthermore there are cheats that help them hide their identity and cause the victim to believe it is their own thinking. Kyrani Eade's answer to Psychopaths, what are you like without the mask? Do you really have no real identity? What do you benefit from answering questions on Quora?\nAll of this is swept under the proverbial carpet by denying ESP and telepathy. https://www.quora.com/Since-there-are-no-actual-signs-of-telepathy-being-real-Why-do-people-attatch-themselves-to-such-a-concept/answer/Kyrani-Eade\nThus the person suffers, their metabolism is shifted over time so that they become ill and hence can be treated with drugs.\nIt is vitally important that humane people form groups and repeat the foul game play as experiments. When a person has gone through the experiment as a \u201cvictim\u201d subject, they can then be an \u201cobserver\u201d subject for the next victim experiment and hence realize where the problem lies. This way we gain the information that we need to help people who are essentially being abused so badly as to become mentally ill.\nAt present the psychiatric profession is convincing the public that the problem is caused by their fictional chemical imbalances in the brain. https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-scientific-evidence-linking-chemical-imbalances-to-mental-illnesses/answer/Kyrani-Eade\nAnd furthermore that mentally ill people are the serial killers and thus are all potentially dangerous. It causes people to shun a victim of this sort of abuse rather than be empathetic and supportive enough to help them. Worse still it causes public apathy, which means the glue that holds a community together is slowly eroded and dissolved away. It is a very serious problem.\nIn this answer I discuss a woman at work diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and I found her concerns were real. https://www.quora.com/What-is-paranoid-state/answer/Kyrani-Eade", "This is not true: delusiiins are extremelly personal and idiossincrasic - no two psychotic patients have the same delusion\u2026", "I believe it has a lot to due with your environment when it comes to delusions.\nI suffer from Late-Onset Schitzoaffective disorder with psychotic features.

Intelligence 69 (2018) 8-15.\nFrom this paper:\nA particular strength of the present study is the unique dataset from the FLS, which spanned infancy through adolescence, and comprised multiple assessment waves within each developmental period allowing for the construction of latent variable models. Undoubtedly, the FLS dataset provided an unparalleled opportunity to investigate and contribute to the long-standing issue of stability of intelligence from infancy through adolescence. This research revealed that when a latent variable analysis is applied to a set of repeated measures throughout the course of development of this specific time-frame, stability of intelligence is evident beginning in infancy. This stability is best characterized by a stage-autoregressive model, in which each subsequent developmental period is predicted by its immediate preceding developmental period. Understanding the stability of intelligence helps re-searchers to better estimate changes in intelligence across develop-mental periods. The autoregressive pattern suggests that changes in children's relative standing in the distribution of intelligence occur gradually, year by year, and accumulate from infancy through adolescence.\nSource of the above figure: Stability of intelligence from infancy through adolescence: An autoregressive latent variable model; Huihui Yu, et al.

A number of more contemporary longitudinal studies support the stability hypothesis. However, drop out effects have the consequence that most longitudinal studies end up with relatively few subjects. In the present study we determined absolute as well as differential stability in general intelligence g, and in verbal and arithmetic abilities, longitudinally for 4000+ adult male veterans drawn from the Vietnam Experience Study (VES). The subjects were given five cognitive tests in their early adulthood. Approximately 18 years later, 14 cognitive tests were administered. Two tests, one verbal and one arithmetic, were administered on both occasions. A Principal Axis Factor analysis was conducted separately on the tests from first and second testing in order to extract both a \u201cgyoung\u201d and a \u201cgold\u201d general intelligence factor. gyoung was then correlated with gold to determine the differential stability of g. The absolute scores from the recurrent tests were correlated to determine the differential stability and compared using an ordinary t-test in order to estimate the absolute stability. The differential stability coefficients were: 0.85 for g; 0.79 for arithmetic; and 0.82 for verbal ability. With respect to absolute stability of the specific tests, we found a significant increase in verbal score (mean scores; 107.16, 116.52), but no change in arithmetic score.", "Yes, by as much as 15 points.

Without making decisions we would have no autonomy. We make them after consideration or we make them immediately. Either way our decisions are our own.\nBut if we go deeper it becomes less clear cut. We need to consider what a decision is. We can safely deduce that our brains are responsible for our personalities, our memories and all other aspects of self. If this wasn't the case then brain injuries would not change personality or effect memory.\nAny decision must take place in the brain. So what happens in the brain as far as we know?Well neurons pass electrochemical signals to other neurons. They can either fire or not fire, they can also fire at different rates and with different strengths. When neurons fire together they wire together and using this logic they connect to form vast networks. These networks usually serve a specific function and allow us to compute incoming signals to formulate some kind of response and a perception of the world.\nWhen we are very young we used this principal to build a cogent representation of the world. I imagine a young child's world is more a psychedelic muddle of stimulus rather than a stable and formed perception of the world.\nWe don't remember this as adults because when we remember, it is an active process and we are refiring networks which have changed and become integrated since the original memory was laid down. We can never remove the filter once we've built it. We will always see our memories through our most current filter of understanding.\nSo a decision is a firing of networks. That much is evident. A choice has to be made and so networks fire to build a response. The decision will result from how those networks have been connected.\nSo who is making the choice? If all our choices are dependent upon previous connections and exposure to the world then how can we be autonomous at all? Maybe we can inhibit certain networks from firing, so controlling which patterns fire? This doesn't work either because it would still be a previously laid network which inhibits any other network. Without that network being developed previously it could not inhibit anything.\nSo that's how we make a decision. But what's the power of making a decision? The power comes from the idea of choice and free will. As humans we had no understanding of the brain until very recently. It feels like we make choices, so for most of our existence we have held this view as self evident. In the same way it appears self evident the earth is flat, even though it isn't.\nWe have decided all humans act as free agents and therefore are responsible for their actions. We feel we can judge others choices and punish or reward them depending on these choices. With out the idea of decisions we could not do this.\nWere we to accept that environment, genetics and circumstance are really what govern our behaviour then we would struggle to maintain the illusion of living in any kind of meritocratic society. We like to believe those who are rewarded made the best choices. Not that those who are rewarded were just the lucky recipients of favourable genetics, environment and circumstances.\nSo maybe that's the power of decision making. It is a self imposed and shared myth which allows us to maintain our societal structures and to persecute and control others. Either way it seems decisions are pretty powerful.", "Well you just make one the problem as I see is people are always worried about making the wrong decision so they don\u2019t make a decision at all. Unless your dealing with a life situation which rarely never happens it doesn\u2019t matter what decision you make so just make one and stick to it. I have made lots of wrong decisions so I really don't second guess myself.", "OK - Decisions will give your path meaning. When you decide you will either take the left or the right path.

At every turn, we take small or big decisions. With regard to decision making, I have seen two approaches implemented by people when making a decision.\nMost of the people would make decisions after careful thought and consideration. They assess every pro and con and think about the matter for several days/months. Most people would agree that this is the right way to make a decision.\nAnother strategy in decision making could be to make decisions at the spot rather than thinking about the matter for days. I believe it is better to make bad decisions than to procrastinate. Most of us in our daily lives delay the decisions which needs to be made promptly and procrastinate behind the excuse of \u2018\u2019THINKING\u2019\u2019 the matter thoroughly. Following quote summarizes the second approach very eloquently:\nGood decisions come from experience. Experience comes from making bad decisions\nMark Twain", "See, decision making is involved in almost every aspect of life I mean everything we do is probably the result of a decision made by our mind consciously or subconsciously. So whatever happens with us is the result of the decisions that we make.\nThat\u2019s another thing that emotions related to different decisions are different I mean we regret some of our decisions and on the contrary we feel happy and proud of some of the decisions that we take.\nSo if we talk about the power of decision making then one thing is for sure that it holds great importance because our future is directly dependent on our decisions.\nNow if we talk about my way of decision making I just try not to take any decision without giving any thought to it and by giving thought I mean I usually try to imagine all the possible situations and circumstances that will be the result of my decision and from all those the one I find most favourable I go with that one.\nBecause for me at last what matters is a sense of satisfaction and I try not to regret any decision that I\u2019ve made.", "Analysis the problem make a list of possible ways to solve it and then select the best and eassiest way.

It is imprecise therefore, and will tend to confuse two quite separate experiences, with their own psychological dynamics.\nConcepts of 'perfection' fall into the category of 'idealisations'. These can be deliberate, as for example when we use mathematical ideas like that of a 'circle'. There can never be a true circle found in the Universe - they will all be approximations - but the idea of a perfect circle is of great utility.\nHowever, quite distinct from this use of idealisation is the psychological defence mechanism, to which we all subscribe from birth.\nThe psychological idealisation, which artificially divides reality and produces mental representations that are for instance all 'good' - angels, Jesus, Madonna - and all 'bad' - witches, devils, monsters - is employed on an unconscious level in infancy and childhood to imaginatively protect those we love from our hostile and destructive fantasies. We love the perfect mother who feeds us, but when she frustrates us we ascribe this to the poisoning witch, and the wicked step mother.\nThis unconscious deceit must be paid for in subsequent years of re-integration and remorse (guilt), but it is necessary for the psychic survival of the infant, whose tantrums seem like to destroy the world.\nThis creation of the idealised 'perfect' other - which is also the mechanism supporting 'falling in love' - is very different in feeling terms from the 'perfectionism' of the ritualistic or the obsessive (OCD), although an anxiety about split off destructiveness is shared.\nHere the problem is again that our hatred and hostility will be stronger than our love, but the fear is that the 'bad', which has been expelled, will seek to return, and will contaminate the 'good', in much the same way that those of us brought up with wet paint or plasticine remember, when the fresh, vibrant colours end up in a brownish mess.\nThe obsessive house cleaner cannot tolerate a speck of dust, because the bad, which it represents, is felt to 'be' pent up somewhere, having unconsciously been imagined to be evacuated, like going to the toilet, only it is felt to harbor the wish to return in vengeance.", "I can only speak from experience here. I had a perfectionist mother who was emotionally distant whom I wanted to please. It pleased her when I did more and did it right so I took that role on. It created friction with my siblings that I had to live with though.\nFast forward six decades and the view is clarified. She had genetic and behavioral issues, lost her mother young and married at 15. She lived with many hardships and pulled it off with class until self soothing with alcohol brought her down. We had a complicated, often painful relationship. I was different and never fit in to the core family nature. Even though I did more and tried harder, I was often the butt of family jokes. Very late I learned that I was on the spectrum with ASD.\nSome of us are people pleasing perfectionists because we need what it gives back to us, positive attention and a sense of accomplishment. We don\u2019t have to remain in a rut of having to be perfect, that can become destructive. We can claim and appreciate the perfectionist skills we learned as children and decide to achieve a goal or please a higher Good and ourselves too. Balance and serenity are what matters, being congruous with ourselves.\nI\u2019ve honestly had a different take on my need to be perfect probably each decade of my life. My studies took me in different directions creating a progressive evolution. Now perfectionism belongs to the Divine and for me takes the form of making a perfect effort subject to human frailties.

How we can fight bullying\u2019s psychological effects (like the trauma or pain/ negative thinking pattern that comes from being bullied) or how we can fight bullying in a way that avoids psychological effects (like maybe getting called into the principles office and having to talk to your persecutor)?\nSo, I\u2019ll answer both.\nIn the first case (how we fight bullying\u2019s [negative] psychological effects), there are a lot of options people opt for like therapy, counseling, having faith in a God that loves you, redeems you, and wants what\u2019s best for you, that will definitely help. The most damaging psychological effects of bullying (and abuse) usually have to do with thoughts and beliefs about oneself. When people have been attacked in one way or the other their mental processing suddenly is somehow attacking themselves, in a way that continues that abuse (and bullying) to themselves. So it\u2019s like the wrong-doing done to them replays in their mind and they constantly have to deal with it over and over again.\nAnd it may not even be conscious to them unless they really decide to think about their thinking and face their pain. Facing the negative perceptions they have about themselves due to the wrong done to them, and also erasing any unnecessary guilt or shame they have because of things actually done to them would help to minimize the constant negative psychological effects.\nAlso, they need to face the real problems they caused for themselves and the ways they started to hurt themselves (and in some cases people around them) due to this way of thinking/the negative way of viewing themselves and their lives - especially in regards to the way they were bullied. (For example, someone bullied about their weight might start seeing themselves as fat and \u201cugly\u201d and might start punishing themselves for eating what they like, or tell themselves off for how they look - they might pass it on to those around them too.)\nSo, in conclusion, I think the first (and most vital) step to avoid the negative psychological effects of bullying/abuse is to make sure that the victim thinks about what happened to them. That they analyze that it was done to hurt them and does not define them. And it\u2019s incredibly difficult (near impossible - and not sustainable in my opinion) to do this without faith. I believe in Jesus and I think that the process of realizing that you were made for a better life - and your worth is not defined by what other people say or what even you as a flawed human say about yourself is truly liberating. Instead be defined by the Divine Creator who loves you and made you to be a beautiful light in the world and share love, kindness, and joy with the rest of the world. To live not by your standards alone but by the ultimate standards of what it means to be a person who is righteous (in right-standing with God) which comprises of love, love, love, and love. You can\u2019t go wrong with viewing your life in the light of love, giving up your negative thoughts, receiving redemption and renewal from your own wrong doings, and realizing the beauty of the God who made you. It will free you.\nChanging ones mindset and transforming ones life is the best way to deal with the effects of bullying and abuse.\nThe second case, ( how we can fight bullying in a way that avoids [negative] psychological effects) is an important topic to touch, because often times the way people attempt to deal with bullying causes psychological damage to people who\u2019ve been bullied, and does not help the bully to actually feel any type of remorse and want to change.\nThis has to be dealt with in the case of how the victim is treated, and how the bully is treated. I will put this one in numbered points.\nThe victim must be heard. It is not acceptable anymore (from my perspective) to pull two students into the principles office because the victim was brave enough to state that they were bullied. It\u2019s just not acceptable. First, the victim must be thoroughly heard and the authorities should make sure they feel heard. Their voice should not be dismissed. The principle or teacher who heard of the wrong doing, should not ask the child or teen: \u201cDo you think there\u2019s any way you could have stopped it from happening?\u201d \u201cWhy do you think this happened to you?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come to us sooner?\u201d off the gate. They should really hear the kid/person out fully before judging them or the situation.\nCall the parents in separately. I don\u2019t know if every school does this or if any school does this, but I think it\u2019s important to not bring the victim\u2019s family with the bully\u2019s family because of various problems that could occur. One being that the two families trying to defend their children start fighting with each other (although this may just be a dramatic rendition of events). However, it\u2019s just polite to allow the victims family to be called in and to kindly express all the information - and in some cases the child should not be there (especially if it will just give them shame or make them feel bad) - while in other cases if they had already told their parents, they should.\nThe bully must be heard. Get the bully\u2019s version of events, and then try to call in other classmates and see their version of events. This part for the authorities may be difficult because there\u2019s bound to be conflict between the two accounts(especially if the bully is defending themselves - or in the rare case where the victim is exaggerating or even outright lying). So that\u2019s when discernment really comes to play. Make sure to really think about what this kid/person is saying and think about what the victim said, ask the teachers, ask the classmates more questions, ask as many people as possible before coming to a conclusion.\nBe respectful to both parties and try to get reconciliation. This is the hardest part but will almost certainly ensure less to no psychological effects. Reconciliation takes the asking for forgiveness with utmost sincerity from the bully, and forgiveness given from the victim. Both may be difficult to arrive to for the bully and the victim depending on the situation, but in the case where the bully was wrong and the victim was hurt, this is a really healing way to resolve the issue. The bully should still be punished with whatever consequences the school has for bullying but getting to that point where the bully tells their story (that doesn\u2019t excuse the wrongdoing) and then admit they\u2019re wrong will mostly make the victim understand and forgive and will give the whole situation a chance to grow into a acquaintance relationship or even possibly a friendship. Have the victim know they were wronged, it wasn\u2019t right, they should let it go, and they are loved. Have the bully know they were wrong, it wasn\u2019t right, they should change, and they are loved.\nIt\u2019s a process sometimes. Not all these things will be possible or applicable to every situation, and sometimes it needs to play out with time. But it\u2019s so important that if people see someone getting bullied, and they want to report it, they rally the school around it. The mindset of the school is so important as well. Schools where people are singled out and bullied and this is seen as normal are toxic environments, but schools that are aware of the problems and effects of bullying in a real way can grow and move forward even if there are cases.\nHope this helps. :)", "Do not be the kind of person a bully looks for. This tactic will avoid the mental negativity that comes from being bullied. However, this answer is extremely difficult to achieve.\nUntil we can learn to stop showing qualities that bullies are attracted to, there are other steps we can take. The biggest and most effective step is understanding bullies. Once understood, you are equipped to counter them.\nWhile avoidance of bullies is a wonderful tactic, it often not an option. Fighting a bully takes courage, but if you don\u2019t understand their motivation, you are swinging wildly, so to speak.\nReporting bullying behavior is one of the most effective tactics, but often takes so long to produce meaningful results.\nThere are many opinions on who and what bullies are. These are my beliefs about some of the more common bullies.\nBullying behavior is an effort to dominate another person.\nPeople attempt to dominate when they feel insecure.\nBy insecure, I mean they feel a need for more control of their life.\nWhen they cannot develop that control, they attempt to control someone else\u2019s life. At least some portion of it.\nThe act of bullying is similar to leeching.\nBy controlling some part of another person\u2019s life, a bully will feel more in control of their own life.\nBy causing someone pain, the bully feels better. It could be said that a bully feeds off a victim\u2019s misery.\nEvery time a bully is successful, it proves (to the bully) that they are better (in their mind).\nA bully measures success by controlling another person and getting away with it.\nDo not allow them to control a victim (if possible).\nDo not allow them to get away with bullying. Make them feel unsuccessful.\nCaution. When unsuccessful, bullies will often try again, much harder, thinking they were not thorough enough the first time. They will often intensify their effort brutally.\nWhen a bully is caught, they will shift blame to the victim.\nTry to blame a bully\u2019s behavior and not the person. It is much easier for people to accept and address behavior. It does not always work, but does work often.\nThis is why revenge on a bully is not recommended. They use it against you and you appear to be the aggressor.\nRevenge on a bully will not help them understand \u201cwhat it feels like\u201d.\nThe bully will only feel less control in their life and fight harder to regain control.\nLikely, the bully will find a new victim who will be harmed far more because of the recent revenge. Bullies are very vengeful.\nThere is salvation for some bullies. They can be helped.\nIt requires a deep understanding of what motivates a bully\u2019s behavior.\nIt requires reteaching a bully how to gain positive control in their lives without harming others.\nMost people are not capable of helping a bully. Professional assistance has the best chance of success.\nBullies \u2018test the market\u2019 to find victims. This is the best time to prove you are not a \u2018good candidate\u2019.\nA bully will look for something you are ashamed of or a mistake they can exploit.\nThey will make fun of the issue and watch your response closely. If you desire to hide it, that attracts the bully. Secrets make people stay quiet longer.\nIf a bully sees that an issue affects you very personally, they will consider that issue \u2018ammunition\u2019 for controlling you.\nIf you comply easily with a demanding bully, the bully will translate cooperation as control and increase demands.\nBullies avoid recognition as bullies (except the expert bullies).\nWhen a bully is testing the market, bring their behavior to light as bullying (even if joking). While they will defend or laugh off the suggestion, it will often cause them to withdrawn interest in you.\nIf you defend a victim of bullying often, the bully will find a way to separate you from the victim. The victim has to push back also to dissuade the bullies attention.\nWhile a bully commonly comes from an abusive (mental and often physical) childhood, their behavior cannot be condoned.\nDo not easily accept apologies. For a bully, apologies are permission to start again. Require changes in behavior before any apology is accepted or trust is shared.\nAccept and reward non bully behavior. Reject any bully behavior. Show that bully behavior hurts and is not acceptable. Do not make exceptions unless you want to lose progress.\nForgiveness (not forgetting or trusting) is recommended.\nForgive the bully to begin healing your pain. Not to condone their behavior.\nForgive the bully to show forgiveness is possible and to allow their pain to begin healing. Not to imply anything they did was excusable.\nForgiveness does not mean a wrong is corrected. No. It only means you are acknowledging that an injury to you was made and you are ready to heal the pain. You are doing nothing more.\nIt is recommended, if you verbally forgive a bully, that you tell them very clearly that you forgive what they did, but will never trust them as long as they keep the same behavior.\nAlways remember that bullies have been disguising their behavior most of their lives. Whether they consciously or subconsciously behave like bullies, they become good at bullying because they succeed.\nCause them to fail in their bully efforts and have better behavior examples for them to follow. Even if you will not spend time teaching them, provide the better example of positive and harmless behavior.\nHope this helps and take best of care!", "Stand up for people, fight.", "First get a tight relationship with God and pay attention to the fact that he wants us all to live in peace, but not to take abuse from anybody. It\u2019s called taking courage, not accepting doing evil to end evil.\nSecond, Trauma has to be taken to oneself in order to be damaging. You can either call on God to help you fight whenever you\u2019re attacked and avoid being traumatized or you can try to hide from what\u2019s happened by taking fear or trauma to yourself.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I feel pity for anyone who has been bullied and brutalized; My mom and older sister are survivors of multiple sexual assaults and I had to save a girl from being abused by her boyfriend not long ago, so I know well how tough things can be for trauma victims. Nevertheless, you can beat it with the courage that comes from God alone.\nAll through the bible is God\u2019s edit to fight evil, protect the the helpless and succor the needy. Sometimes you can do this by just being kind to your family or neighbors, doing community work and speaking up for God\u2019s goodness and majesty; other times you may have use your fists or weapons to save a victim and uphold law and order.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a lawman or EM worker or not.

This nation was created by hard-working people who dreamed of a land filled with God-fearing folks who would do was is morally right at the moment.\nGod can take away your trauma instantly if you turn to him and not trauma. Trauma is a choice, don\u2019t take it!", "We can band together as a group who cares for the victims or as friends who stick together like glue. We can better our self-image to build our confidence in ourselves and our abilities to fight against what others shamelessly take away from victims. We can make sure that people understand how the victim feels. Bullying made me feel smaller than I never was inside and that just tells you what It can do. Finding out who we are really helps us stand up to people who call us something we are not. I feel like the Psychological effects of bullying lead to the way we feel about ourselves and how we interact with others as well, such as being distrustful to others and thinking low of ourselves and so having good self-esteem and image prevents us from feeling like we are nothing as well as giving us the confidence to know we are not what others say we are unless they are good things. The icing on the cake is having good friends who will stick up for you when you can't or will help us as we stand up for ourselves. All this is from experience and how I think we can at least negate psychological effects and it starts with US not our wallet or doctors. To all the victims out there I want to say that you ARE worth it, you are never alone in this fight, you have people who care about you, you just need to find them because they ARE around you and to me you are out of my sight(because we are separated by a screen haha) but you guys are NEVER out of my mind.", "Tell the teacher, or Police officer.\nPsychopathic, sadistic, and sadomasacistic people cannot learn that bullying is wrong, they don't want to learn.\nThey need to to be in a mental hospital, and rehabilitated with drugs for their mental conditions.", "Believe that who you are and how you live your life are right for you and the doubts that the bully tries to impose on you will have less impact.\nKnow who your friends are and what makes them valuable to you and what makes you valuable to them.\nBe connected to other people in your actual, living social network. Do things with other people, be part of a team or club, have social interactions that are supportive of you and others.\nRecognize that bullies try to amplify characteristics that they don\u2019t like in you so that you can acknowledge the core of their complaint without buying into the extremity of it. For example, a bully might call you a nerd for carrying your books home. Fine, you are a nerd in that person\u2019s eyes because you are willing to do homework. You are doing that for your own benefit and not the bully\u2019s benefit, so if they see that as what nerds do, you may be a nerd to them.\nWhatever a bully picks on is not all of your humanity. They would like it to be viewed that way, but it is not all of who and what you are. Your job is to recognize that and not become obsessed with wanting that small part of you to go away just so the bully will like you and not pick on you anymore.\nTry to remember that the moment in which the bullying occurs is not going to be active for the rest of your life. There are many things that happen in a person\u2019s life and those things are passing moments. If you can survive this moment, there is more of life ahead of you that will not be tainted by this experience.\nMost people have been bullied at some point in their life. It is fairly rare to find anyone who cannot tell a story of having been bullied. You have to determine for yourself that you are not willing to let the bullies keep you from becoming who and what you want to be in life. That would be a terrible and tragic loss for the world if people gave up on their own potentials in order to feel safer in the moment. Perhaps, it is like knowing that there are dangers in the world, but explorers have to accept the risk in order to explore. Bullies are like those dangers. They come with the territory and, knowing that, you can be prepared for them.\nYou may even want to consider what you might say to a bully or what actions you might take when bullied before you need to say or take them. Don\u2019t try to be too clever. Don\u2019t try to be too dramatic. Think about what is quick, clean, easy and effective so that you have something to fall back on if and when you need it.\nAnd, if you want to act as a community, then engage a group of people who will stand up to bullying. Bullies rarely remain combatant around crowds. People do not need to fight the bully and create bigger problems. They need to step forward and state that they stand up to bullying, shoulder to shoulder with others of their kind, until the bully backs down.

Other therapists sometimes told us when they felt attacked, showed their frustration, admitted they were wrong and one even cried! I had no time for this type of therapy and let them know about it! Most of them were women and I took their showings of emotion to be weak and I didn\u2019t trust them.\nDavey, though, did not bend to my disgraceful efforts at charm or flirtations and neither did he buckle under the weight of my rage, tantrums, silent behaviour or downright \u2018bullying tactics\u2019 as he called them (to the therapists, never towards the other patients).\nWhen I pushed boundaries he let me know this was not ok, when I was angry he let me rant, when I was emotional he encouraged me to express my feelings but also understood when I needed to leave the room, so shameful to me was crying in front of people. When I ignored him he, frustratingly, told me he saw me and focused on other people who needed and were willing to talk.

He\u2019s seen me cry, he\u2019s seen my anger, he\u2019s seen the switch flip from normal emotional connection to anhedonic and tried to help me explore that. I remember early in therapy just wanting my depression to be gone, and he asked me if I could ever see myself living my life to the fullest while still experiencing depression. I said absolutely not. Months down the line, I was at that place. I said, \u201cyou must think I\u2019m ridiculous, saying I could never be where I am now\u201d. He repeated it back, \u201cI must think you\u2019re ridiculous? Why must I?\u201d He then went on to talk about Albert Ellis and \u201cshoulding your pants\u201d and \u201cmusterbation\u201d and we had a great big laugh.\nKeeping boundaries strong despite the storm. I admit I have gone back and forth between pushing those therapeutic boundaries and being grateful for them. I\u2019ve wanted them to change in about a hundred different ways over the last year and they never have which has actually been great. He never responds to me differently, no matter what state I\u2019m in, whether craving more attention or even physical touch (hugs for clarification), and at first I was super hurt by this. A couple months back, I experienced something traumatic, and all of a sudden, I put up boundaries so fast, some of my friends were concerned. Still, my therapist was a constant I could never replace, and we worked through a happy medium between the before and after.\nThe test relationship. Honestly, if I went up to a friend or family member and said, \u201cI want to test being more assertive or being more selfish, I want to say no and learn that it\u2019s okay to put myself first sometimes\u201d, they would look at me like I was missing a straight jacket. Not my therapist. He thinks it\u2019s great any time I want to try something like this.\nThe phobia safety \u201cairbag\u201d. Like how an airbag protects you from getting really hurt in a crash (seatbelts too everyone), my therapist helps me explore things that give me anxiety or fear without you know, crashing too hard. I once saw my therapist in the hallway when I was going to fill my water and he was on his way to the bathroom. I squeaked and ran away and it made for an interesting session. I had a fear of what to do if I saw him on the outside, as we hadn\u2019t talked about it yet. He profusely apologized because normally he would have mentioned it early on, but we set up a play scenario where the next couple of sessions, I\u2019d go refill my water right before session and \u201caccidentally\u201d run into him again. It\u2019s gotten a lot better.\nGosh I\u2019m sure there is so much more but these are just some of the things a therapist can do that really no other person in my life can because that unconditional positive regard just isn\u2019t normal for most of us.", "For me seeing a therapist gives me the unique opportunity to experience a role where I do not take care of someone else. My coping mechanism to survive a traumatic childhood was to focus entirely on other people's needs and repress my own. This has been great for my career but pretty catastrophic for my mental and physical health.\nThe boundaries inherently present in the therapeutic alliance with my (rather brilliant) therapist mean that I am absolved of my responsibility to look after her. I'm finally learning to recognise and accept that I have needs of my own. I'm finally learning to establish boundaries and implement self care.\nI could not have done this without a therapist.

All three approaches adopt a group-selection perspective, so that the group's network structure is (approximately) optimal, given the information-processing limitations of agents within the social group, and the exogenous welfare function of the overall group. In the first approach we use a new sub-field of telecommunications theory called network coding, and focus on a welfare function that involves the ability of the organization to convey information among the agents. In the second approach we focus on a scenario where agents within the organization must allocate their future communication resources when the state of the future environment is uncertain. We show how this formulation can be solved with a linear program. In the third approach, we introduce an information synthesis problem in which agents within an organization receive information from various sources and must decide how to transform such information and transmit the results to other agents in the organization. We propose leveraging the computational power of neural networks to solve such problems.

So, as you asked, \u2018What are the primary and secondary symptoms of repressed memories\u2019? I could come up with some acceptable examples which we could look for in a person, but I won\u2019t, simply because I feel listening to someone is far more important; also when the time is right repressed memories have a way of coming to the surface all on their own.\nOn one occasion, during a conversation, without notice my wife\u2019s daughter happened to mention that \u2018all-the-men in her life, leave her\u2019. There was four of us have lunch in a food court of a busy mall and as usual, I feel that things happen for a reason and if it was appropriate things will happen. I asked permission if she felt like looking into her state of \u2018all-the-men in her life, leave her\u2019 and find-out why? I simply ask her to take a deep breath and focus on her body (I didn\u2019t feel it necessary to have her close her eyes and do a proper induction) and feel, sense and intuitively just know where this feeling comes from, within her body. The short version of a 20 minute opened-eye session revealed that this repressed memory had to deal with the loss of her step-father who had passed-over shortly after and tears of releasement flowed just before I had brought her full attention back into the room.\nA young man overheard a conversation I was having during a coffee break I was on and asked if I could help him with him having an allergic reaction to peanut butter. We made arrangements for me to come over to his quarters after working hours and see what we can find out. Another short 30 minute session and the repressed memory contributed to his allergic reaction as both his brother and himself were raised in a foster home and the caregivers were using drugs in peanut butter cookies so they could molest the children. Tears of releasement followed and a newer expectations and outlook on his life enthusiastically filled him.\nWhen the time is right repressed memories have a way of coming to the surface; as in this other incident\u2026 Diana and I had become personally acquainted with a lady as she had attended weekly meditations at our place and one evening she told Diana that she had a biopsy done and that she had the developed a cancerous growth in her chest; it was about the size of a silver dollar. Diana received the impression that she needed to come and see us for 5 consecutive Reiki sessions.\nWhen we first began I was standing next to the top of her head and she started to exclaim that there was a knotty kind of pain under her left armpit and she reached for my hand to have me feel it\u2026 oops! \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t do that I said to myself\u201d (the lady had large breasts) and I wasn\u2019t comfortable placing my hand there. I asked Diana to do the deed and asking Diana to lightly stimulate the area and I proceeded to do a hypnotherapy session and I had the lady focus on the pain she was receiving. The lady was about 54 years of age at the time and she was being strapped around her breasts with some sort of large elastic bandage/harness to suppress the milk. (sorry, coming from a man\u2019s understanding, I can\u2019t describe this any better.) But, what ensued shortly, I don\u2019t ever want to hear it ever again, was a \u2018soul cry\u2019; a cry that seemed to leave the original pain hanging in the air as I got her fully to let it all out (writing this brings me right back into the session which happened over 20 years ago. Apparently she had given birth and felt it necessary to give the baby up for adoption; suppressing the events, decisions and the memory of the child. She felt she had dealt with it and let it all go, never giving it a second thought.\nEventually, we were able to resolve the cellular memories and completed the Reiki session. Diana mentioned to the lady that she also had to come for a one-on-one hypnotherapy session with me, the next day. The lady turned up and we during the session it was revealed that she had also made a decision that was having an effect on her at this time. The decision she revealed was that, \u2018When her last child was born and after she entered university; her job here (on earth) was done.\u2019 Her health conditions seemed to coincide as her youngest daughter entering university 2 months prior to the session I was conducting. Decisions were changed and new resolutions were made after consecutive session her a cancerous growth in her chest (about the size of a silver dollar) reduced to the size of a dime.\nI feel my journey through life has been more of a hands-on approach than following someone\u2019s sculptured format.", "People don't remember things for a number of reasons. It can be as simple as uninteresting events loose resolution in memory over time or that the frequent retelling modifies, simplifies and sanitises memories over time.\nI suspect this question is about trauma memories. There is great survival benefit in both erasing and remembering traumatic events. If you remember them then like BPD or PTSD they can haunt you and damage your life prospects. If you forget them entirely then this reduces your ability to survive again on reoccurance of the event. Given that you survived once then the survival learning is valuable.\nThe optimal survival strategy for memories is to do both. The main personality is denied access to the trauma memory but a managed copy of the personality maintains the memory and the survival learning to be applied again when triggered on reoccurance.\nGood plan Mr Brain. It's a common and successful strategy which is why DID is so common at around 4%.\nThe other mechanism for not remembering and modifying trauma response behaviours which is even more common is just regular old anxiety. Most people are unaware that anxiety also involves the repression of traumatic memories.\nBoth brain strategies affect different people in different ways depending on the age the nature of the trauma and individual experience.\nSigns can include sadness without knowing why, suicidal thoughts, life confusion, developing inappropriate response behaviours such as in OCD without knowing what is driving it. It's also common to experience disaffection where words and ideas associated with past trauma are actively suppressed in real time leading to momentary freezes, confused speach, missing words the inability to understand the meaning behind some everyday concepts or a more limited palette of emotional responses.", "This isn't a book, it's a psych major's junior year. It's easy to say that all clinical psychology not involving an organic lesion derives from repressed emotion.\nIf we use the first bifurcation of psychiatric disorders as dissociative and conversion symptoms, repressed psychic material is skewed toward conversion; that is, physical symptoms founded on psychic stress.\nHans Selye, working out his own stress following WWII, tied the link between unexpressed emotion and traumatic stress in the body. He eventually composed a scale of life experiences and their levels of stress, with Death of a Child at the top. In popular circulation, readers were astonished to see that Winning the Lottery was as stressful as Loss of a Wife or Husband on his scale.\nBut how does repression become stress? In 1927 Cannon and Wada observed the change in stomach acidity and heart rate in anxious cows going to the slaughter. Spitz and Golfarb carried out a series of groundbreaking studies on orphan babies in charity institutions, showing that infants denied the soft parenting functions; rocking, eye contact, hugging during bottle feeding, singing and talking, and aressing, became anxious, developed illnesses, were 20 to 30 % behind in growth milestones, and measured one standard deviation lower on IQ tests later in adult life.\nIn these studies, the lesson is that emotion is energetic, whether positive or negative; fear inflicted or love denied.\nRepressed experiences produce stress the same way trauma or neglect does. But the symptoms that bring a human being to a psychotherapist are often more subtle than anxiety and upset stomach. Freud's insight as early as 1890 was that the energy of emotion when pushed below conscious awareness will \u2018sublimate' through dreams, jokes, slips of the tongue, and symptoms; and things like glove paralysis where a patient presents with a numb hand in obvious variance with the neurological facts of radial vs ulnar nerve involvement on either side of the hand and arm to the elbow.\nIn 1997, Pennebaker found that repressed emotion affects immune response. Depression and insomnia are classic keys to repressed emotion-- almost a cliche that ignores neurochemical factors -- but it's actually hard to find a neurotic symptom without a repressed analog.\nIn an interview with Dr. Hugo Rosen in Miami years ago, the psychoanalyst related a tale from his memory in response to my question similar to the one put forward in Quora. It was about an old married couple who came to him at the insistence of their pastoral counselor preliminary to a divorce after 50 years of marriage.\nWhen asked why, the old husband said his wife insisted on sleeping with the window open whereas he could not accept sleeping in a room without the windows closed. They had fought to an impasse, and could find no way out but to separate.\nFurther discussions revealed that one spouse was Jewish and the other Catholic. They had put off all mention of religion over the years, raising one child in the Christian church and the other as a Jew. But now, as the kids were out of the house and on their own, they found themselves unable to handle the issue of ventilation.\n\u201cFacing the prospect of death,\u201d Dr. Rosen told me, \u201cwhich is represented by sleep, they each thought it unthinkable not to address their religious issues. The partner wanting the window open was crying out to \u2018air out' their differences, whereas the one who refused to open up thought it impossible \u2018to see any way' to approach the end of life together.\n\u201cThe old gentleman said, \u2018It is wholly impossible \u2018 to go on.\u201d\nRosen heard \u2018wholly\u2019 as \u2018holy,\u2019 an expression of deep spiritual needs.\nWhen he helped them understand their conflict, the couple hugged each other and dabbed their eyes. It was now an issue of working together to reconcile what they had always thought was irreconcilable differences and stay together till the end.\nAll repressed emotion is a knot of energy buried in memory screaming to get out.

Yet they can turn around and enjoy reading or looking at paintings or structures more. That\u2019s just how art is, and always has been.

In fact, it\u2019s beauty comes from the fact that it isn\u2019t bound so tightly by rules all the time.\nSo just like a painter might not enjoy sketching, or a pianist might not enjoy singing, so can a person hate music yet love reading.

This inability track or control the energy you spend over time makes it very hard to tell when you are going to crash.\n.ADHD motivation block can occur at any time, the more tedious or boring tasks usually setting it off. However, if the person with ADHD has a lot of energy expended for whatever reason, it becomes a lot harder. This is both because tasks can be easily disrupted, and because the brain gets foggy when tired. Going back to the earlier example, to enter my card into Amazon I would have to\nFind my card by digging through all of the random junk in my purse.\nGo to my phone and search Amazon\nfind the webpage that will allow me to complete my tasks\nEnter all enter all of the information correctly and in the right order.\nfor most people, this kind of step by step process is completely natural. You don't think about it, you just do it. But with executive functioning issues, ADHDers tend to break things down step by step consciously, especially if it's a task we're not good at. So not only do we have a task that bores us, we have a task with so many little steps that it seems insurmountable and overwhelming. It's difficult for us to plan ahead and schedule and follow the schedule because that's controlled by executive functioning. there are so many places to get hung up in the process I outlined above alone. Where did I meet my block, you may ask? Well, once I convinced myself to do it I stopped about halfway through step one. I couldn't find it just by fishing around, and the thought of having to go through (and possibly lose) everything in my purse to find it, taking down my purse when I had about five other things on the same coat rack, was just too much. Would I need to take my purse off the coat rack? Why can't I find it on the first go through? That's stupid. cards are so stupid. They're almost as bad as Internet passwords. That reminds me, I'll have to make sure that my internet password for The Sims is stored properly. Man am I tired. This is really stressing me out\u2026 ECT. ECT. So I think that our brains do this because we subconsciously know that we're going to have to go through all of that\u2026 again.\nAt least for me, it's not the tasks themselves that completely turn me off- a little boredom is bearable and giving me good for you. It's the steps that it takes to get there. Someway, somehow, the natural process of start to finish gets tangled up, and that leaves me anxious and makes it even harder to do the task.", "Yes, there are tasks that I really don\u2019t like, but see the need for it to be done.

To an extent, at least. I think it a perfectly valid answer and not entirely incorrect, but it\u2019s also not entirely correct in its absolutist black-and-white viewpoint.\nI was clinically diagnosed NPD in 2016, and prior to that had been in and out of therapy with various psychologists and psychiatrists over the previous 10 years. I wrote a blog post about it.\nRose Swan's post in Diagnosed NPD - My Experiences\nThere are some physical anomalies in the brains of people with NPD, particularly in the insula region. However, whether this difference can be accounted for by nature, nurture, or both is still up in the air. It\u2019s well known that if certain areas of the brain are not adequately stimulated and used in childhood that significant development of those regions may be difficult if not impossible in adulthood. Language is a very good example of how environment, not genetics, can cause permanent brain dysfunction into adulthood. But I digress. My point is that there are some structural differences in the brain that make it exceedingly difficult and unlikely for a disorder such as NPD to ever be \u201ccurable\u201d.\nThat said, I have definitely made numerous meaningful, long-term changes. This is by all accounts, from people who have known me for a very long time. I do receive remarks on it from not only my husband of 10 years but my friends and family.\nAnother misconception is that narcissists \u201ccannot feel empathy\u201d. This is empirically false. This misconception is based on a misunderstanding of the DSM diagnostic criteria\u2014a section in the diagnostic manual most people never read to completion, I might add. To the assertion that we \u201chave no empathy\u201d I counter with the following, which includes links to studies and their respective authors:\nRose Swan's post in Resources and Information on NPD\nI do indeed have a capacity for affective empathy. I think Dr. Elsa Ronningstam\u2019s description of it being \u201ccompromised and fluctuating\u201d is very apt, however. My capacity for empathy is definitely impoverished compared to what I see in others, but it\u2019s also definitely there. I am also perfectly capable of and prone to shutting it off like a light switch. I cannot force myself to empathize, but I can force myself not to and find it easier more often than not to do so. There are reasons deeply ingrained in early childhood trauma for me to repress or misuse this capacity rather than to value and treasure it. tl;dr doing so only got me hurt and I learned not to touch that hot stove.\nThat said, as of 2016 at least I still meet the diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder, including the underlying motivations and other contexts most people casually googling and skimming the DSM entry do not read about or understand. My symptoms and traits do pop up on a regular basis ranging from grandiosity to entitlement to a stunning amount of insensitivity to and disinterest in the wants, needs, and feelings of others.\nNPD is incurable, in my humble opinion. That said, it is amenable to therapy if the narcissist can become self aware enough and lower defenses enough to cooperate and learn from the experience. This usually requires hitting absolute rock bottom and everything falling apart in the narcissist\u2019s life for such a realization to happen, let alone a desire for and commitment to change.\nI\u2019ve mellowed out a lot over the years and it\u2019s lulled some people into a false sense of security I think. I\u2019m not as outwardly volatile as I used to be because I\u2019ve learned some coping strategies and redirection techniques, not to mention concepts like radical acceptance and stuff from DBT. I\u2019m also not nearly as manipulative and exploitative as I used to be.

If our actions are right and we resolve our problems here and now, then you need not work on the subconscious. So what is important is present and paying attention to present.\nTo Be Human ~ J. Krishnamurti\n\u2026Now, the question asks, ''Is the subconscious a superior entity?'' That is the first point. Is there a superior entity apart from the thought process? Surely, as long as the thought process exists, though it may divide itself up into inferior and superior, there can be no superior entity, no permanent entity apart from that which is transitory. So, we will have to look into this question very carefully and understand the whole significance of consciousness. I have said that when you have a problem and have thought about it until your mind is weary without finding the answer, it often happens that when you sleep on it the answer is found the next morning.\nWhile the conscious mind is still, the hidden layers of the unconscious mind are at work on the problem, and when you wake up, you find the answer. Surely, that means that the hidden layers of the mind do not sleep when you go to sleep, but are working all the time. Though the conscious mind may be asleep, the unconscious in its different layers is grappling with that problem, and naturally it projects itself onto the conscious. Now the question is, is that a superior entity? Obviously not. What do you mean by ''superior entity''? You mean, do you not, a spiritual entity, an entity that is beyond time. You are full of thoughts, and an entity that you can think about is surely not a spiritual entity - it is part of thought; therefore, it is a child of thought, still within the field of thought. Call it what you will, it is still a product of thought; therefore, it is a product of time, and therefore it is not a spiritual entity.\nThe next point is, ''Is it not necessary to pour out all that is hidden in the labyrinths of the subconscious in order to decondition oneself? How can one go about it?'' As I said, consciousness has different layers. First, there is the superficial layer, and below that there is memory, because without memory there is no action. Underneath that there is the desire to be, to become, the desire to fulfill. If you go still deeper, you will find a state of complete negation, of uncertainty, of void. This whole totality is consciousness. Now, as long as there is the desire to be, to become, to achieve, to gain, there must be the strengthening of the many layers of consciousness as the 'me' and the 'mine'; and the emptying of those many layers can come about only when one understands the process of becoming. That is, as long as there is the desire to be, to become, to achieve, memory is strengthened, and from that memory there is action, which only further conditions the mind. I hope you are interested in all this. If not, it does not matter, but I will go on because some of you may be aware of this problem.\nSir, life is not just one layer of consciousness, it is not just one leaf, one branch; life is the whole total process. We must understand the whole total process before we can understand the beauty of life - its greatness, it pains, its sorrows, and its joys. Now, to empty the subconscious, which is to understand the whole state of being of consciousness, we must see what it is made up of, we must be aware of the various forms of conditioning which are the memories of race, family, group, and so on, the various experiences which are not complete. Now, one can analyze these memories, take each response, each memory and unravel it, go into it fully and dissolve it; but for that one would need infinite time, patience, and care. Surely there must be a different approach to the problem. Anyone who has thought about it at all is familiar with the process of taking up a response, analyzing it, following and dissolving it, and doing that with every response; and if one does not analyze a response fully, or misses something in that analysis, then one goes back and spends long days in this unfruitful process. There must be a different approach to deconditioning the whole being of memories so that the mind may be new every moment. How is it to be done? Do you understand the problem? It is this: We are accustomed to meeting life with the old memories, old traditions, old habits; we meet today with yesterday. Now, can one meet today, the present, without the thought of yesterday? Surely, that is a new question, is it not? We know the old method of going step by step, analyzing each response, dissolving it through practice, through discipline, and so on. We see that such a method involves time, and when you use time as a means of deconditioning, obviously it only strengthens the condition. If I use time as a means of freeing myself, in that very process I am becoming conditioned. So, what am I to do? Since it is a new question, I must approach it anew. That is, can one be free immediately, instantaneously\u2026", "Try it than intellectualising it.\nsome of my experiences been shared in my previous comments if it is helpful feel free to read them.

But client never learns much about their therapist. Many clients struggle with this alone.\nThen there is the fact that clients are in therapy for a reason. They are struggling with life.Some of them have been abandoned by everyone in life including parents and lovers. Abandonment is often a reason they are in therapy to begin with.\nWhen a therapist terminates a client, it reopens old wounds. There may be good reasons for the termination, but the client feels as if they have been betrayed. If they can't trust their therapist to be there for them who can they trust.\nOf course the client will often blame themselves because they seldom know why they are being terminated.

You are using your experience of life as a yardstick by which to measure his. Read my answer to an other question and you will see how frustrating and fruitless your approach is. You have to grasp how and why his mind is beyond your experience. Here\u2019s what I wrote:\nWhen toddlers have a little mishap or can\u2019t perform a little task, they often cry. That\u2019s how nature made sure Mom would come to the rescue. Crying is sure to get Mom\u2019s attention. Works every time. No other animal produces tears. So why we humans? Because we need the trust of others and teamwork on many levels to survive. That requires a high level of psychological and social development allowing us to accept our limitations and the limitations of others. Cooperation cannot be hindered by individual shame. To reach that level, we have to overcome the shame of failure.\nHow do we do that?\nThose little mishaps, frustrations, and failures of toddlers provide tiny experiences of shame, producing tears, not tears of pain but of shame. This brings Mom to our side to console and encourage us. These are little lessons in shame repair. Through repetition of these lessons, our brains lay down circuitry so we can perform shame repair on our own. We learn that it\u2019s not the end of the world to make mistakes. Mom does, we do, everyone does, so life is good. This skill, acquired by the age of two, is what allows us to enter adult/group life later on, handle our limitations, help others and appreciate the help we get from them, and have confidence in ourselves and in others. After the age of two, the opportunity to learn shame repair is over. There\u2019s too much else we have to learn, starting with language.\nBUT, if our early upbringing is such that our mishaps and cries for help produce, not Mom\u2019s comforting and patient encouragement, rather impatience, disdain, and disappointment, shame repair is not learned. Just the opposite. Constant expectations from Mom which we cannot meet can lead to our concluding that we are indeed no good. We fear that we might be abandoned because of that. Failure is not ok. Not at all. We are ashamed of our failures. We are even ashamed of being ashamed.\nThis was a description of what I call \u201cunder-mothering.\u201d But \u201cover-mothering\u201d can be just as harmful. Those mothers dote on their kids to the point of smothering them. Kids need the freedom to make mistakes, realise that these were little failures, and then receive just enough consoling and encouragement so they feel good about continuing to explore the world and their place in it. The message \u201cover-mothering\u201d can give a child: In order to maintain this stream of praise and adulation, I have to continue to be perfect. That stunts growth. To grow, we need to make mistakes. \u201cIf first you try and don\u2019t succeed, try, try again.\u201d Nature provided the coach: Mom. The expression \u201cgood enough mothering,\u201d coined by psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott, says it all.\nTo defend against the fear of being abandoned, some toddlers find out pretty soon what makes Mom happy and what doesn\u2019t. Like laboratory animals, they shape their behavior to receive the pleasurable reward of Mom\u2019s approval and to avoid the pain of her disapproval. This adaptive behavior is what is referred to as the \u201cfalse self.\u201d\nAnd it works! But the price of this protective strategy is a person who replaced who and what he really is with a fabrication, a human being lacking the skill of shame repair and haunted forever by that early feeling of inadequacy that drove him to develop this false self in the first place (by the age of two). Such a person spends the rest of his life acting out this fabrication, seeking validation from others, dismissing his limitations (mistakes), avoiding anything that could conceivably cause him shame, and denying any responsibility, in order to keep the bubble of this false (perfect) self inflated. It is the adult continuation of the survival adaptation he made when he was still a toddler. That is the genesis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD).\n(There is a book written by another psychoanalyst called The Narcissistic Pursuit of Perfection.)\nAnd since this all happens before the age of two, those who have NPD have no recollection of when or how it happened, nor do they think they are any different from anybody else. People able to repair shame use this skill every day without even thinking about it. It\u2019s part of being human. Those who do not have this skill are still driven by their childhood feeling of worthlessness and are constantly in fear of being exposed. Any little thing can trigger their defences. Like a tsunami, these defences and the panic behind them override any acceptance of truth, fairness, or consideration of others. These people are trapped inside a bubble of their own creation which they protect at virtually any cost. The normal/natural things we expect from other human beings might be there in the background. But the thing that matters NOW to people with NPD \u2014 and at every inkling that they might appear less than perfect (always right) \u2014 is to hide from exposure by building themselves up or tearing others down, which is the same thing, and by using their bag of tricks to avoid, escape from, or annihilate any perceived threat.\nBut exposure to what? What are they afraid of? Of having limitations, which for the rest of us is as normal as breathing. There is nothing in the current lives of people with NPD that justifies their being ashamed of anything. Yet that\u2019s what they feel, subconsciously, all the time. A haunting feeling of shame, without understanding why or how it started, that others go about their lives without it, or how to get rid of it. It is literally all in their minds, and it is hardwired!\nTo peel away the layers of this false self and the knee-jerk defences that keep it inflated, and to recover what is salvageable of the true self, are the challenges of therapy.

Jung could not be other than phenomenological because he thought our empiricism could not decide the question of whether or not spirit, or soul, was substantive. Had Jung been able to empirically demonstrate spirit as substantive (independent), then he would be remembered as a physicist, not a psychologist. He could only demonstrate its therapeutic effect. I don\u2019t see where Jung has had a significant cultural effect comparable to Einstein\u2019s e=mc2. And Jung expressed doubts as to whether analytical psychology in theory or practice had the potential to counter the cultural effects that came from e=mc2. I tend to agree with Jung\u2019s misgivings. With or without Jung, we will bow down to nature, that should be clear enough today to anyone who recognizes how much harm our species has done to her, that she be merely mechanical is but an illusion.\nIf you want a quick introduction to the profundity of a Freudian, try Bruno Bettelheim\u2019s The Informed Heart. It should be mandatory reading for every college student so that they may be prepared as to what to expect from their future co-workers. Certainly not solidarity in a rigid top down hierarchy. His application of Freud\u2019s defense mechanisms as an analytic for psycho-social behavior in a concentration camp (he was in Dachau not technically a death camp, not an extermination camp) is extremely valuable for its insights. Beyond all else as a moral education. But if spirit is substantive, it listened to those exposed to absolute evil; what went silent was not spirit, but human consolation. Tell me then we aren\u2019t incinerating ourselves now, take a look at Planet of the Humans for the lies. Do we tell without them being heard? Clearly we know not what we do. If Jesus got anything right that was it.\nSo. What\u2019s the future of an illusion which says spirit isn\u2019t substantive? Freud did not have such categories in his description of the psyche, the soul. Jung did. There\u2019s a difference. If spirit is substantive, is independent, it has a point of view that isn\u2019t bound to ours. Spirit as illusion is an idea that has no future, has produced no future from those who lie for a living everyday, and for those who repeat lies without feeling they have a choice between substances. That\u2019s the problem. Whatever we do not make conscious, our lying for instance, rules over us as fate. That may not be Jung\u2019s insight, but it is a timeless one. There is no future in our illusions. It\u2019s gone. What to do then as our population crashes?

In reality I wasn't aware of how zoned out I would be, but now that I am I try to come back whereas before I just let it ride.\nI feel things too much. I didn't realize this before. I had no idea that it wasn't normal for your emotions to control you\u2026 I thought that was just how it was for everybody. Instead of me being in control of how I feel\u2026 how I feel controls me. My emotions are my reality and they are intense. I didn't know that everyone doesn't feel things as strongly as I do.\nI'm constantly trying to please people. I want to make everyone i care about happy and be there for them so much that I put their needs above my own and it never gets reciprocated. I know how it feels to be let down and not be cared for and I could never intentionally let somone feel that way. That would be blasphemous in my mind.\nAny threat of betrayal or abandonment sends me completely off the deep end. I go into a rage or emotional mess or completely shut off. Where as a narcisst would get revenge\u2026. I get intensified 10000% in my emotions. I take whatever you did to me out on myself, instead of you. But you are still punished because you have to watch, that's not my intention but I realize now it's reality. I'm hurting you by hurting myself. Only I don't see it at the time. Afterwards I feel guilty for your hurt even though it was me who was hurting. Abandonment sets me off on a roller coaster ride of crazy. Im more loyal than a Labrador retriever so for you to betray me feels like a sword in my chest and my blood is boiling hot and running fast all through my body with no where to go. I'm not sure if you understand how pure rage feels but that's what I feel when betrayed. Abandonment feels like a stab into my chest of emptiness and I don't even know why you took the time to stab me since I am nothing\u2026 I should have and could have done a better job but I am not good enough. HOW THE FUCK COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME!?!?!!?\nI am preoccupied with thoughts of my SO to the point of obsession. I thought everyone thought this way about the person they love. I am disappointed when I realize they are not preoccupied like this by thoughts of me.\nMy anger scares people. I didn't know this before either but now that I do I look back and can understand why people didn't tell me certain things. They were scared of my reaction. I thought everyone got as angry as I did..they do not. My anger is always there just under the surface and when something sets it off I do not control what it does, it controls me. Now that I'm aware I can take steps to keep it to a somewhat manageable level.\nI feel everything, all the time. I can see what you are feeling and I feel that too\u2026 I take it in as my own so I can help you\u2026 it's exhausting. Which is why I disassociate\u2026 I have to turn it off. Nuerotypicals do not feel this and it's hard for me to understand regulated emotions. My emotions are intense. Not just the bad ones but the good ones too. But mostly the bad ones.\nWhich is why I work extra hard to make sure people do not feel those bad emotions because I know the hell of them. Until you betray me\u2026 like I knew you would. Then I see red.", "What I\u2019ve struggled with the most is being healthy enough to choose men that are capable of giving and receiving love.", "Not knowing who i am and not trusting my own instincts. I didn't know this until recently, and now that i observe myself sometimes it's even harder. I never really trust that my perception of any situation is correct , or my reactions. Very hard to live each day questioning everything i do say buy eat etc. I just call i do everything wrong all the time.", "Some of the things I struggle with now are a bit different than when I was younger since I\u2019m trying to improve but some are the same.\nBefore it was always extremely hard to keep a job. The longest jobs I\u2019ve had were about 7 months. In between those longer periods when I\u2019m extremely unstable I get a job and stay maybe a week or 2, sometimes not even a week. I\u2019ve been at my current job since November and so far I\u2019m doing pretty good.\nMy relationship with my parents has been pretty bad since I was younger. Things declined really quickly at a young age. They would get better for a bit then rapidly decline. It was that viscous cycle for years. Now it\u2019s also so far doing pretty good.\nOne of the biggest struggles I still have right now is when people ignore me. I\u2019m sure a big portion of it is from my BPD, however it also got worse as my abusive ex used to ignore me to make me learn a lesson. If I\u2019m on app where I can see if someone reads my message but they don\u2019t reply I have a mini panic attack in my head. Going through everything that could be wrong.\nAnother issue I still have kind of goes with the first one, but if someone doesn\u2019t open my message at all or I haven\u2019t heard from them in a bit, I freak out and start worrying about anything bad, usually that they died. That doesn\u2019t happen if I know that person is doing something where they can\u2019t reply, but if I don\u2019t know then my mind just freaks.\nSomething I do want to point out with my romantic relationships is that I do have actual love for them when I\u2019m with them, but my love is I guess more obsessive than the normal person. With my 2 serious relationships, one ex and my current boyfriend, I\u2019ve already done DBT therapy and I was already able to sort of find a balance between the extreme idealization then just when I think everything about them sucks. That was a huge issue I had when I was younger. Now, I do still go through the idealization phase with people, but when I start to switch I\u2019m able to stop it and realize that they have good qualities AND flaws. I know it\u2019s not just straight obsession at this point, because even once I realize the flaws and stuff, I still have extreme love for them. It\u2019s just based off how I see most people talk about their love for their partner, mine seems just more obsessive.\nThe biggest struggle I have right now is with my boyfriend. We\u2019ve been together for a bit over a year and everyday I fight the negative thoughts in my head. I try not to push him away or think he\u2019s going to leave. One thing I\u2019ve gotten a lot better with is expressing my fears to him, making sure he knows I\u2019m not blaming him for anything. When I do that, he always shows support and assures me he\u2019s not leaving. It eases it up a bit, but it\u2019s still a daily struggle. Sometimes if I think he worded something differently or didn\u2019t text me like usual, I freak out thinking he hates me now.\nProbably the main thing I wish people could understand is that I don\u2019t try to hurt them. I don\u2019t push them away specifically to cause them pain. When I see that I hurt someone, the guilt is severe and then I tend to push them away more because I know they deserve better than me. I push people away as a mechanism to keep myself from hurting. Kind of counter productive because when I push them away, I hurt anyways. But that\u2019s how my mind used to go, and does go in the more rare recent times, when I started to push someone away.", "Thank you for the request Wayne.\nI myself do not have BPD but my foster son does so I can only answer using my own observations regarding what I have witnessed over the past 5 years.\nInterpersonal relationships.\nHe is so desperate for close friendships that he falls hard and falls fast. He is incredibly loyal and generous and goes out of his way to be there whenever his friends need him. This is rarely reciprocated and it tortures him. His need for closeness means he ignores glaring red flags about the other person and always ends up being hurt. This confirms his belief that he\u2019s worthless, unloveable and evil. His loving heart \u2018rescues\u2019 other tortured souls who will ultimately betray him. I\u2019ve lost count of the people who were the greatest thing ever but are now blocked and dead to him.\nRational thinking.\nHis logic is insightful and reasoned when he is stable. When triggered though it is a thing of astonishing and bewildering chaos. Those amplified emotions kick in and can make you doubt your own sanity. When he returns to baseline it\u2019s impossible for him to recognise or admit fault- if his thinking is wrong then he himself must be defective. If he\u2019s defective then he doesn\u2019t deserve to live. Which leads me too\u2026\u2026\nControl.\nToo many things in his childhood were out of his control- the neglect, the violence, the belittling\u2026.\nHe has to be in control. Advice is never merely advice. It means someone else wants him to act a certain way in order to have control over him. He will do anything, even if it\u2019s dangerous, harmful or just downright stupid to prove that he can\u2019t or won\u2019t be under anyone\u2019s control again. Understandable but often not helpful.\nSleep.\nHe fights sleep. That\u2019s when the nightmares come. 50+ hours awake and then 30 hours asleep is not unusual. It\u2019s caused him to miss so much. School, counseling, parties, job opportunities. Screws his medication regime. I\u2019m not allowed to mention or advise on it because that is control * see above!\nHe\u2019s in pain. Almost all the time. He\u2019s navigating a strange world without a guidebook because his fuckwit parents never gave him one. He feels so deeply all the time. Everyday there is a trigger just waiting to happen. He\u2019s exhausted just trying to live. But he can love. OMG can he love!\nAs he matures he is becoming more self aware but it\u2019s a double edged sword. With that self awareness comes the knowledge of the damage he sometimes causes due to his BPD and the cycle begins again with the self loathing and worthlessness. Nobody should have to live this way.\nLove your kids. Support your kids. Hug them when they screw up. Tell them that we all make mistakes. Don\u2019t starve them. Or beat them. Or ignore them.

The executive function allows us to actively control attention (focus on a task) and is positively correlated with intelligence. It is also positively correlated with working memory capacity, presumably because higher WMC allows a person to proceed with the solution to a problem with fewer changes in the representations held in memory.\nAnother aspect of attention is that it is dependent on the inhibitory function, which allows us to filter out stimuli that are unrelated to the task at hand. When this function is low, we are more easily distracted. Low inhibition, however, is helpful to the creative process. [See The Cambridge Handbook of the Neuroscience of Creativity (2018) Rex E.

Also, even if they say things like \u201cI have never cheated before\u201d in a past tense, that might just mean that they never had the opportunity and the truth is a convenient ego boost.

No tests required. Just do exactly what you were going to do or ask or whatever with them, and look at the reaction. Good or bad, did the response validate your immediate need, or did they antagonize it? People call it hot and cold behavior, but I think there is a little bit more animosity behind it, as you will see that they are always doing exactly what you don\u2019t want. For example: you want to go get ice cream on tuesday, they say they are busy with work that day. No big deal, next week on tuesday you make other plans, next thing you know they show up at your doorstep with ice cream, making you feel guilty for making other plans.

We rarely see paranoia with depression unless it is part of Bipolar Disorder but we do occasionally. When paranoia appears in depression, there is an anxious or fear component but often there is also a component or worthlessness or hopelessness included as well.

This break in reality can take the form of paranoid delusions, which are irrational thoughts and fears, or hallucinations, where a person sees or hear things that aren\u2019t there.

People with paranoid depression usually understand that what they are experiencing isn\u2019t real. Paranoid depression is often more challenging to treat than schizophrenia because paranoid depressed individuals may feel embarrassed or ashamed of these disturbing symptoms. They are less likely to be upfront with their doctors. Psychotically depressed patients are often reluctant to reach out to clinicians because of pervasive feelings of fear and distrust.\nAlso, many delusions may not be evident to clinicians. Psychotically depressed patients may exhibit vague, general feelings of suspicion, such as losing their house.", "Severe anxiety and depression are disorder-type health conditions, while paranoia is rather an effect of excessive panic.

Good day.", "yes", "Brain activity in sync with the heart.\nThe Heart and Its Electrical System.\nWhat controls the timing of your heartbeat?\nYour heart's electrical system controls the timing of your heartbeat by regulating your:\nHeart rate, which is the number of times your heart beats per minute.\nHeart rhythm, which is the synchronized pumping action of your four heart chambers.\nYour heart's electrical system should maintain:\nA steady heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute at rest. The heart's electrical system also increases this rate to meet your body's needs during physical activity and lowers it during sleep.\nAn orderly contraction of your atria and ventricles (this is called a sinus rhythm).\nSee a picture of the heart and its electrical system\n.\nHow does the heart's electrical system work?\nYour heart muscle is made of tiny cells. Your heart's electrical system controls the timing of your heartbeat by sending an electrical signal through these cells.\nTwo different types of cells in your heart enable the electrical signal to control your heartbeat:\nConducting cells carry your heart's electrical signal.\nMuscle cells enable your heart's chambers to contract, an action triggered by your heart's electrical signal.\nThe electrical signal travels through the network of conducting cell \"pathways,\" which stimulates your upper chambers (atria) and lower chambers (ventricles) to contract. The signal is able to travel along these pathways by means of a complex reaction that allows each cell to activate one next to it, stimulating it to \"pass along\" the electrical signal in an orderly manner. As cell after cell rapidly transmits the electrical charge, the entire heart contracts in one coordinated motion, creating a heartbeat.\nThe electrical signal starts in a group of cells at the top of your heart called the sinoatrial (SA) node. The signal then travels down through your heart, triggering first your two atria and then your two ventricles. In a healthy heart, the signal travels very quickly through the heart, allowing the chambers to contract in a smooth, orderly fashion.\nThe heartbeat happens as follows:\nThe SA node (called the pacemaker of the heart) sends out an electrical impulse.\nThe upper heart chambers (atria) contract.\nThe AV node sends an impulse into the ventricles.\nThe lower heart chambers (ventricles) contract or pump.\nThe SA node sends another signal to the atria to contract, which starts the cycle over again.\nThis cycle of an electrical signal followed by a contraction is one heartbeat.\nSA node and atria\nWhen the SA node sends an electrical impulse, it triggers the following process:\nThe electrical signal travels from your SA node through muscle cells in your right and left atria.\nThe signal triggers the muscle cells that make your atria contract.\nThe atria contract, pumping blood into your left and right ventricles.\nAV node and ventricles\nAfter the electrical signal has caused your atria to contract and pump blood into your ventricles, the electrical signal arrives at a group of cells at the bottom of the right atrium called the atrioventricular node, or AV node. The AV node briefly slows down the electrical signal, giving the ventricles time to receive the blood from the atria. The electrical signal then moves on to trigger your ventricles.\nWhen the electrical signal leaves the AV node, it triggers the following process:\nThe signal travels down a bundle of conduction cells called the bundle of His, which divides the signal into two branches: one branch goes to the left ventricle, another to the right ventricle.\nThese two main branches divide further into a system of conducting fibers that spreads the signal through your left and right ventricles, causing the ventricles to contract.\nWhen the ventricles contract, your right ventricle pumps blood to your lungs and the left ventricle pumps blood to the rest of your body.\nAfter your atria and ventricles contract, each part of the system electrically resets itself.\nHow does the heart's electrical system regulate your heart rate?\nThe cells of the SA node at the top of the heart are known as the pacemaker of the heart because the rate at which these cells send out electrical signals determines the rate at which the entire heart beats (heart rate).\nThe normal heart rate at rest ranges between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Your heart rate can adjust higher or lower to meet your body's needs.\nWhat makes your heart rate speed up or slow down?\nYour brain and other parts of your body send signals to stimulate your heart to beat either at a faster or a slower rate. Although the way all of the chemical signals interact to affect your heart rate is complex, the net result is that these signals tell the SA node to fire charges at either a faster or slower pace, resulting in a faster or a slower heart rate.\nFor example, during periods of exercise, when the body requires more oxygen to function, signals from your body cause your heart rate to increase significantly to deliver more blood (and therefore more oxygen) to the body. Your heart rate can increase beyond 100 beats per minute to meet your body's increased needs during physical exertion.\nSimilarly, during periods of rest or sleep, when the body needs less oxygen, the heart rate decreases. Some athletes actually may have normal heart rates well below 60 because their hearts are very efficient and don't need to beat as fast. Changes in your heart rate, therefore, are a normal part of your heart's effort to meet the needs of your body.\nHow does your body control your heart rate?\nYour body controls your heart by:\nThe sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, which have nerve endings in the heart.\nHormones, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine (catecholamines), which circulate in the bloodstream.\nSympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems\nThe sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are opposing forces that affect your heart rate. Both systems are made up of very tiny nerves that travel from the brain or spinal cord to your heart. The sympathetic nervous system is triggered during stress or a need for increased cardiac output and sends signals to your heart to increase its rate. The parasympathetic system is active during periods of rest and sends signals to your heart to decrease its rate.\nCatecholamines\nDuring stress or a need for increased cardiac output, the adrenal glands release a hormone called norepinephrine into the bloodstream at the same time that the sympathetic nervous system is also triggered to increase your heart rate. This hormone causes the heart to beat faster, and unlike the sympathetic nervous system that sends an instantaneous and short-lived signal, norepinephrine released into the bloodstream increases the heart rate for several minutes or more."], "topic_list": ["Heartbeat", "Human Physiology", "Hearts (organ)", "Cardiology", "Social Psychology", "Human Brain", "Neuroscience", "Human Biology", "Psychology", "Human Body", "Science", "Emotions", "Health"], "view_list": [337, 66, 0], "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "no_of_follower": 4, "question_author": "Matt Gailliot", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0], "question_title": "Is the brain more active when the heart beats faster?", "respond_collected": 3, "no_of_view": "2,853", "name_list": ["Shreya Banerjee", "Quora User", "Dynsin Allen"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"]}, "9": {"ans_list": ["Very common!

No injury.\nNo lost money. No innocent bystanders. No apologizing in the morning.\nIt\u2019s not technically an addiction, if you spend all day on social media. Because you can stop whenever some other interesting thing takes place, there is no damage done, and no withdrawal symptoms. If you know someone like this, ask yourself what would happen if they were buried in social media, obsessively, and a friend stopped by with an exciting new gadget, or brought some really interesting people over (like a boy who\u2019s friend brings over a couple hot chicks). What would happen? Would he sneak into the bathroom and hope no-one noticed while he got his fix of Facebook, with the other friends waiting for him? No!\nShouldn\u2019t \u201cobsession\u201d be a good enough word? That\u2019s what it means. It means an activity that\u2019s made unhealthy because it\u2019s done too frequently, creating an imbalance. If someone is obsessed with social media, which is similar to being obsessed with having friends, you might say \u201cbut he didn\u2019t take the garbage out!\u201d You might think, this is the damage, he doesn\u2019t do his chores; he\u2019s lazy!

It\u2019s like having friends all around all the time, as a distraction from chores and homework. They\u2019re \u201cliking\u201d and sharing and making everyone feel good.\nAddiction is pretty specific; there has to be damage done which would not be done if the activity were stopped, and then a strong reluctance to \u201cown\u201d the damage even if it involves innocent bystanders. Social media has all the attraction but it\u2019s impossible to describe specifically how social media is a problem. You\u2019d have to be more specific, like in the example of playing poker online and losing all your money. That would be an addiction to gambling. Being obsessed with \u201clikes\u201d is not hard to understand.\nKeep in mind, obsessiveness, habits and addiction can all have bad results. It\u2019s unclear to me why people seem to want to call internet obsession an addiction. If it\u2019s to point out the seriousness of the situation, there\u2019s no need to reach for an inappropriate term. While a bad habit is not the same as an addiction, it\u2019s a very close cousin, and can cause just as much trouble in someone\u2019s life. Obsessive behavior is borderline antisocial, and also should be taken seriously on the long-term.\nIf you forbade someone who was obsessed with the Internet from ever using it again, you\u2019d probably be doing them more harm than good, because you would not have zoomed in enough to find a more precise problem.

Don't live in regret, shame, guilt, blame and so on as it relates to these people and the experiences you've had with them as well as any of the residual effects of those connections. Instead open yourself up to all that each brought to the surface and may have been trying to help you uncover deep within.\nThat's where the journey of healing begins. Acknowledgement and awareness.\nPersonally, what successfully guided me to, through and still is, is connecting the dots. Retracing the history and origins of each trigger attached or associated with each trauma. Writing my own autobiography, so to speak, and being completely open and honest with myself. Allowing my recollection to take me back to all the things and with that, allowing myself to feel the vulnerability that arose in those times. I cried. I felt icky. I felt disdain.

Yes, I did chakra healing meditations every now and then but for me, once I tapped into the traumatic memories, moments and all each encompassed, and openly acknowledged the feelings, thoughts, emotions, and so on, that was when my biggest healing took place and when I saw shifts in what I attract and no longer do.\nLove and light \ud83e\udde1", "I'm currently trying to do that myself. A lot of hurt and a whole lot of anger has made my life kind of unbearable. I've tried to kill myself several times with the police stopping me twice. It's not pretty but, despite all this nonesense, I'm getting better. I'm not a therapist and childhood trauma usually requires some professional help. Unfortunately I'm one of those unlucky people. I've been searching for help since 2016. Trump has been in office for his full first term and I still don't have any therapy. So I've had to figure out how to get better myself. Here's some useful things I've learned:\nThe first thing you need to remember is that you are not a bad person. You will hurt people sometimes. Maybe intentionally, maybe not. You need to be able to forgive yourself. Accept the response from people you hurt and acknowledge that hurt people hurt people. Your brain has literally morphed itself into a fight or flight machine. It's natural to react extremely sometimes. Just know that it doesn't make you a bad person. Life is complicated and horrible.\nYou may never get closure. This one is hard to hear. There are a lot of people that I want to shout at. Ask why? But the answer I'm searching for doesn't exist. Because, chances are, the people that hurt me are hurting themselves. Abusers and bullies are not normal. They are a failure to cope with life and their own pain. They are so bad at regulation they actively hurt others. If you've been hurt by a peer or a family member 9/10 they have been abused themselves or have similar issues. The other 1/10 are genuinely horrible and you can only isolate yourself from them. Acknowledging that can help heal the pain. Closure doesn't always exist. That's when you have to forgive. You don't have to forgive your abusers but you can accept that it wasn't your fault and they were the ones with the problem\nSlow down. Healing from trauma is a slow process. It takes little bits of convincing your brain that the world isn't out to get you. Your progress will not be linear. It will be all over the place. But always keep in mind the baby steps you need to take.\nSelf awareness and humility. These two things have been so important in my life. I used to not like the idea of humility. Maybe because it was too close to the word humiliation (something my peers used to love to do to me). But then I came to understand what it truly means. If you make a mistake there is no point in beating yourself up. We are all human and humans learn by making mistakes. Everyone does. So why am I punishing myself so much for making a mistake? Do I think that I'm some sort of exception? That I'm better and shouldn't make mistakes? No I'm human. Being angry at myself is a strange form of pride. Realising that it's easier to let go of the pain. Because it's not doing anything for me. Through humility I'm trying to learn to live as a flawed creature the best way I can. In regards to self awareness it's all about learning as much as you can and applying it to yourself. It's easier to do if you are not emotionally strained. Our brains lie to us. The trauma has taught it to believe we are always in danger. I'm trying to catch out when those things happen. I'll sit back and think about my behaviour and apply what I've learned to myself. I can be a little opinionated so I make an effort to listen to others. I sometimes believe the people around me are a threat but that's my brain trying to protect me. It's all about unravelling the things we take at face value. Learning to appreciate yourself as the flawed awkward being you are. That we all are.\nThere are tones of self help options out there. They are not a substitute for actual therapy and having a mental health team is very important. But that shouldn't stop you from learning all you can. I don't really like mindfulness. It doesn't work for everyone. But it's very helpful for some. I would look up mindfulness and cbt exercises. They deal with the current symptoms like intrusive thoughts to try and reshape your brain.\nWhen getting professional help keep in mind your rights. If you don't like a therapist or psychiatrist get new ones. Trust me. There are some shit doctors out there. I know you will feel like you don't deserve help. You do. Everyone does. Therapy requires a personal relationship. If you don't like them for any reason change them.\nI know this is long but eh it's all I've been doing the last 4 years.

The stereotypes are helpful in identifying that you might have it too.\nI discovered I have OCD after having kids and seeing the disorder manifest itself in their actions. My step-mother was actually the first to recognize it. I went to design school and then to Architecture school where my need for symmetry and absolute precision was rewarded with super high grades and universal praise by my teachers. By the time I started my PhD work in Human Factors Engineering my precision was a full blown obsession and my user interfaces were designed with such amazing precision that I would chase 2 pixels around the screen for a year trying to make the alignment \u201cperfect\u201d. Ah, there is that fucking word again\u2026 \u201cperfect\u201d. It\u2019s a good thing that my form of OCD doesn\u2019t carry the \u201c\u201cself-harm\u201d component or I would have killer myself long ago in pursuit of the elusive \u201cperfection\u201d my brain demands of the world. It\u2019s been quite a journey so far\u2026 and the journey is long from over. If anything it gets worse everyday.\nThe OCD was first evident in my oldest son when he used to take all 100 Hot Wheels cars out of his box and line them up on the floor in a straight line, sometimes by size, sometimes by color, sometimes making a pattern, but always with a system behind it. God help you if you took one or switched them around. It drove him nuts. OCD is about a vicious cycle of behavior. First the obsessive thought, then the anxiety, then the compulsive behavior and finally temporary relief. It\u2019s a horrible way to live.\nBy the time we had our youngest and we would play blocks together on the floor it was clear that he had it too. In fact my youngest son may have it worse than I do. He is just like me only turned up to 11. The only good thing is that he knows it and he and I have been working on it for years to help him cope with his anxiety about it and to cultivate it into the superpower it can be for some people. He is super smart and super sensitive so the OCD is just another aspect of his personality. It looks like he will have a 20 year head start on his disorder over me in terms of identifying and dealing with it.\nAs far as my daily life it invades everything I do. All the items in my desk must be perfectly aligned or I can\u2019t work. I also have some of the same hoarding tendencies that come with OCD. Thankfully never wanted to hurt myself but not above hurting other people if they deserve it. Thankfully no counting or hand washing components. It manifests itself in odd ways in my life, but rather than fight it I have learned to pick my battles. My OCD now requires that ice water be in a red plastic Solo cup (sponsorship available) and every night before bed I require 3 tissues from the bathroom. A hold over from the days in my childhood when I used to get nose bleeds frequently but the obsession continues.

It began with this quotation, a man is in a car and a boy tries to sell him a newspaper, but the man turns away and says, regarding the news:\n\u201cThe frightfulness of the world had reached a point at which it had become for him merely boring.\u201d\n\u2014Aldous Huxley (1939) After Many a Summer Dies the Swan.\nI realized the thoughts turning over in my head were causing emotions that I didn\u2019t want to feel, so, like in the quotation, I decided to make the thoughts boring. It involves finding a private place and talking out your thoughts on whatever is bothering you. Even if you\u2019re initially emotional, keep talking\u2014to the person who hurt you, imagine telling it to your friends, and tell off the person that hurt you. Make sure to tap into your sorrow, anger, and frustration. It may take a week, or less or more, it depends, but one day you\u2019ll go to do it and you will just roll your eyes and not bother. Make sure you do it one last time to confirm you are recalling events and thoughts without reliving them, emotionally. You should notice you think about those things less\u2014sometimes that\u2019s due to other thoughts replacing the ones you just worked on (in which case, repeat this process, as many times as you have to, until you find the process getting shorter. Eventually, you may be able to rid yourself of emotion over a topic quickly).\nI advise while you\u2019re doing this to keep a log, just with the date, time, topic you will talk about, and at the end, how long you spent on it. This isn\u2019t for the problem at hand, but to be able to look back and see what types of problems you have had to do this exercise with. That way you can make categories of what sort of thoughts bother you the most. Keep the log for later life, or if you ever need to get into therapy\u2014it\u2019ll help your therapist see what problems preoccupied you the most and had the most emotion attached to them that took longer to remove.\nAt times, if you want, when your situation and accompanying emotions are starting to bore you, make jokes about them. I have a lot of one-liners I came up with, one about being married to my ex-husband, but it can be altered to be about other things. It was a bad marriage, but if I ever start to feel the pain, I remind myself of three funny things, the first is a Line I made up about it:\nThat marriage is like my ass\u2014I don\u2019t feel it, it\u2019s just there, behind me.\nRita Rudner said this one:\n\u201cWhen I eventually found Mr. Right, I had no idea his first name was Always.\u201d\nFinally, I remember something I find hysterical about this man I married who was so condescending, among other things, and I think about how I had to avert my eyes when he was putting on his shoes. If I didn\u2019t, I would have busted a gut because Mr. Superiority, Financial Auditor, tied his shoes by making two bows and tying them together\u2014like a 5-year-old. I was like, who taught him to tie his shoes? Mary Poppins? I never said anything, like, \u201cTie your shoes in private at work,\u201d because it was his problem.\nSo, you see, some topics that make you laugh, you may want to relive when you recall them because it makes the overall process shorter; you ditch the bad feeling and replace it with a laugh which, if you can maintain that outlook, bring up to yourself what was funny and reliving the upset should dissipate.\nI hope it works for you.

I think it's because the part of your brain concentrating on reading comprehension and definition, is different to the feelings part of your brain.

But nonetheless it has definitely helped me work on myself to change my future emotions when I was actually able to become aware of how I thought usually. We can over react sometimes!

I believe we'd be able to behave quite like robots if we could do that, stripped of the function of empathy and compassion, which is key to our functioning as humans in a society (even if we are biased or otherwise egocentric, that exists within our innermost self).\nI can offer you my way of seeing it, and please note that I have no qualifications on the matter. But firstly let me say that what goes on in our brain is the result of chemical reactions. Once you acknowledge this, there is no way you'll not start observing how very similarly humans function (the actions/habits of the way a personality is formed is by the repetition/learning by example mostly, be it beneficial to us or not.\nFor daily life\u2019s functional thoughts (basic necessities) like love (being liked, accepted, acknowledged), hunger and comfort (safety, security for future) are true to everyone.

Something like that. Silver-white describes it better.\nPretty much everything has colors: letters, numbers, words, emotions, people, pretty much any written symbol. Music, too, but the colors are less strong. (This is grapheme-color synesthesia.) Numbers also have vague personality traits (ordinal-linguistic synesthesia).

I associate colors with lots of things, but it only goes one way; I associate pink with May, for example, but if I see that specific shade of pink, I don\u2019t think of the month.\nAlso, there is a logic to synesthesia. For example, most synesthetes associate A with red, probably because of a is for apple. It\u2019s usually harder to figure out than that, but there\u2019s a reason for everything.

So a \u201cwoman's intuition\u201d is quite simply just her ability to notice things that you haven't.", "To understand a woman\u2019s intuition, we must first understand what intuition is.\nHave you ever had someone tell you go with your gut, or have you ever had a gut feeling telling you whether to do something or not. That\u2019s considered intuition.\nIntuition:\nprocess that gives us the ability to know something directly without analytic reasoning, bridging the gap between the conscious and nonconscious parts of our mind, and also between instinct and reason\nTherefore intuition can lead to one reacting without noticing, or unconscious reactions.\nIntuition is talked about in a lot psychology. In science, often it\u2019s referred to as a hypothesis, or a hunch. We all have intuition, no matter if you\u2019re a man or woman. Your intuition is that gut feeling, it can be right and it can be wrong.\nEarly psychology believed a woman intuition was based on her previously encountering a situation and thus applying those warning signs to all her future and present interaction and relationships. Early psychology also believed, she be institutionalized for her pms. so they got a lot wrong, luckily we\u2019ve since changed that.\nBe that as it may, A woman\u2019s intuition is a mighty fine thing, she can be wrong but she\u2019s usually right. How many of you have had your mothers sense something wrong and confront you about it, and had no idea how that woman guessed it. A woman\u2019s intuition whether she\u2019s a mother or nulliparous.\nNow you could argue that a woman\u2019s intuition is myth as google will put it, or can argue it\u2019s real. Either way, a woman\u2019s intuition is simply her ability to apply what she\u2019s previously encountered to what she\u2019s encountering currently.\nif she had a boyfriend or a girlfriend who was a sweet, but abused drugs and a father who was drunk and beat her mother. She will notice these flaws and flags when encountering a person for either a short or extended amount of time. Next time she sees a man with track marks or who smiles to much but the lady on his arm looks distant, she may remember the father who beat her mother. She may even feel the need to do something or say something.\nMaybe she dated multiple men who cheated on her, in a new relationship she may not want to rush, and she may notice red flags much quicker in a current relationship.\nIf she is married to man who had an affair for years, to which she didn\u2019t realize. She may back track to all of the obvious signs she missed, thus applying it to future interactions with her husband or future boyfriend(s).\nNow, it goes without saying this doesn\u2019t apply to every woman, rather, a good portion. Women throughout history have always been taught that their place is behind a man. The moment women started standing up for themselves, putting their foot down. Essentially amplifying the man in woMAN.

That\u2019s why you should go through the following list and see if any other symptoms apply. If so, I would suggest that you get her to go to see a psychiatrist so that she can begin a treatment plan if and when this might be depression.\n1. Irritability\nMost people think depression leads to overwhelming sadness. Sometimes, people with depression experience anger and irritability rather than hopelessness and misery.\nIf you've noticed increased irritability\u2014or it seems like the people around you feel like they need to walk on eggshells\u2014don't ignore it. Don't blame your impatience and anger on your stress level or workload. Take a moment to consider the possibility that you may be depressed.\n2. Sleep Difficulties\nWhile an occasional restless night or two isn't necessarily a cause for alarm, persistent sleep difficulties or insomnia can be a symptom of depression. Many people with depression struggle to fall asleep, or stay asleep, despite feeling exhausted.\nOther people with depression sleep too much: They struggle to wake up in the morning, can't wait to go to bed at night, and often take naps during the day as well. If your sleep habits have changed, it's important to address the possible underlying causes.\n3. Aches and Pains\nThere's a powerful link between your body and your mind. When you're struggling with mental health issues, you're likely to experience physical problems.\nMany people are tempted to dismiss unexplained aches and pains as part of the normal aging process, but back pain, headaches, and sore muscles can be signs of depression.\n4. Decreased Energy\nDepression can zap your energy and cause you to feel lethargic and tired most of the time. Many people dismiss their exhaustion, thinking, \"Well, I haven't been sleeping lately,\" or, \"My workload causes me to be tired all the time.\"\nBut consider how your energy level may have shifted over time. If small tasks now tire you or take longer to complete, you may be depressed.\narticle continues after advertisement\n5. Guilt\nUnnecessarily blaming yourself for the events in your life isn't healthy. If you feel guilty about everything, from your divorce all the way back to a fight you got into as a kid, you may be depressed.\nMany people with depression also feel worthless. Pay attention to your inner monologue: If it's overly harsh and critical, it could be a sign of depression.\n6. Recklessness\nPeople who look like party animals on the outside may be suffering on the inside. Frequent gambling, risky sexual behavior, and substance abuse\nmay all be attempts to mask unpleasant emotions.\nIf you or someone close to you has started indulging in new risks lately, it could be a sign of trying to cope with inner turmoil. Unfortunately, these types of unhealthy coping skills will only provide momentary relief\u2014and can actually make depression worse in the long-term.\n7. Concentration Problems\nIf you're struggling to stay focused, or you feel like you're in a fog, it could be a sign that you're depressed. People with depression are often forgetful and frequently misplace everyday objects, like their keys or paperwork.\nAlthough today's digital world leaves most of us feeling a bit distracted, concentration problems may also stem from mood disorders. If you've noticed a decline in your productivity or you're having difficulty staying on task, consider the possibility that you may be depressed.", "It could be depression, anxiety, a combination of the two.

I have a theory.\nJust like the other five senses, some are blessed with great eyesight. Some people are deaf. Some can smell a rose halfway down the block, where others can\u2019t smell their own body oder. We all get dealt a \u201cdeck\u201d in life where some senses are stronger then the others. The biggest challenge for those with psychic abilities are to nurture their gift, even when a sector of society\u2026 the skeptics claim the gift is not real.

Now, since public speaking is such a high-stakes game, it is full of intimidation and rewards for people, depending on how they approach it.\nPublic speaking is still a nightmare for many people for the fear of judgment. Many people think that if they speak something wrong or say something stupid, people will judge them negatively. People fear public speaking for the fear of losing dignity. Little do people understand that the audience is not always so harsh and demeaning. My experience shows that audience mostly shows respect for those who muster the courage to come up on stage and say something. This fear of judgment leads people to stammer and forget their words on the stage, which leads to embarrassment. If people for a moment discard the need of pleasing people, then i am sure people will be able to speak more fluently, for everyone has a story to share and a story to inspire others with.\nThe people who are confident with oratory are not the ones who have mastered the art of speaking, but have mastered the art of handling fear. They know how to contain their fear and how to manage themselves when they seem to be forgetting their content. They know the exact techniques to hide that fear and therefore, come out as confident. When people see someone so confident and so fluent speak to them , they want to listen more. Therefore, the good speakers and good managers of fear tend to influence people as they are able to communicate their ideas in a better fashion. Once people begin following them, it creates a network effect and more people flock to listen to the speaker, based on word-of-mouth promotion.

If a person becomes aware of the conditioning that is applied on them, then that person might start the process towards individualization, which alas is often reduced to person\u2019s vain desires for transcending their own conditioned images of themselves or personality, instead of pursuing what is immanent in themselves: namely, the improvement of humanity by actions devoid of antagonism that are increasingly recognised as actions with a distinct and actual value that might serve as a template for the universal response to the human universal quest being built.\nIn context, and accordingly to speech acts theory, when utilizing human languages we tend to use it partially by ignoring the part that enable speakers to get the intended meaning in utterances because we are bound to depend on known clauses with which we keep regurgitating opinions that are not necessarily useful if they don\u2019t contribute to universalize the response to the universal human quest.\nIn my opinion to act devoid of antagonism carries the humanity spirit that is effected by agonistic actions.

I\u2019ve attached a research article to this answer to help you further understand the principles you\u2019re looking into. In short \u201cA key interest of positive psychology is the analysis of happiness which has been broadly defined according to two opposing philosophical traditions: hedonism and eudaimonism. The hedonic view equates happiness with pleasure, comfort, and enjoyment, whereas the eudaimonic view equates happiness with the human ability to pursue complex goals which are meaningful to the individual and society. Besides analyzing the antecedents, correlates and consequences that happiness entails for human well-being at the individual and community levels, recent trends in positive psychology call for the integration of the hedonic and eudaimonic views into a global theory of human well-being, and stress the need to adopt a cross-cultural perspective on happiness which would take into account a world-wide concept of a life worth living.\u201d", "Eudaimonia\u2019 is most commonly understood as meaning \u2018happiness\u2019 in Ancient Greek. Many scholars argue that a more suitable english translation for \u2018eudaimonia\u2019 is \u201cflourishing\u201d.\nEudaimonia is the focus of the classical philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, who put great emphasis on the idea that the purpose of life is to seek the fulfillment of our true potential. Here are the basics concepts that have been outlined with living a eudaimon lifestyle.\nThe Purpose of Life Is to Flourish\nAristotle taught us that our overall purpose in life is to accept our human nature in seeking to flourish into the best versions of ourselves. In modern times, so many of us are inspired by notions of hedonism\n2 . Practice Aristotelian Virtues\nIn developing your eudaimonia, Aristotle believed that an individual would be active in practicing his 12 virtues outlined in Nichmochaen Ethics, these include: courage (bravery), temperance (moderation), liberality (spending), magnificence (style), magnanimity (generosity), ambition (pride), patience (calm), friendliness (social IQ), truthfulness (honesty), wit (joy), modesty (ego), justice (sense or right and wrong).

When you trust yourself, you are confident in your ability, your reasoning to make a decision that will benefit you in achieving objectives, or to help you deal with challenges.\nDoubt is inner questioning, it is you having an inner conversation or an argument with yourself.\nDoubt is you wanting to make a move but not trusting the outcome will be positive.\nDoubt is you being cautious or afraid to take risk.\nDoubt is a hesitant confirmation to an external stimulant that requires a positive action or answer.\nYou must trust yourself first before you can begin to doubt yourself. Why? Because you know you, you own you. Therefore, you are automatically confident enough to doubt or question what you can do or say.\nBeing automatically confident is the same thing as doing something out of habit. It is doing something naturally, mindlessly, or without thought.\nWhen you trust yourself to doubt yourself, you are giving doubt a chance to be an automated process just like blinking your eyes is automatically done.\nSelf doubt\u2026 if you don't trust you, who can? Doubt is a self-reflection of an individual\u2019s ability or inability to do something. You are saying that you know yourself enough, to doubt what you can do.\nWho can argue with you, when you know yourself enough to doubt yourself? When you trust yourself, you are trusting your judgement and your decisions to do or say things. When you doubt yourself, you are asking yourself questions and arguing with yourself. You put your trust in self doubt.\nThere is an advantage to self doubt. When you use doubt as a tool or excuse to make a decision, you approach things with a question. You refuse to be over confident. Self doubt allows you to reason with yourself and to think before you act.\nOne disadvantage of self doubt is that it can limit you and prevent you from taking risk. We cannot simply live our whole lives in certainty. We must assume some risk in life. Self doubt is a fear of risking failure. It is important to doubt self, but also to realize that failure is a part of the process to succeed, hence, do not put too much trust in doubting yourself.\nYou must be able to trust when and why you must decide to use doubt as a tool when making decisions for yourself.\nRonke Taylor PhD\nhttps://coachingpsychology.today", "You must first make a good decision that you think is or was sound and you trust in.

It is obviously the starting point for the social scientists struggling to save our economy.\nThe fact that it is not in the minds of the social scientists is a very very bad omen comrades.

This is based upon the fact that I can\u2019t find anyone pushing Smith in these times of trouble.\nIf I am wrong as I have not read everyone on solutions, probable so, I apologize. But I still think I can come up with the best plan from Smith.\nJust because we have no power to put the winning plan in action and so save ourselves doesn't mean we can\u2019t flex our intelligence whereas the real Adam Smith expert will be pinpointed.\nJust to be clear, there are two very serious flaws in our intelligentsia:\nThe ones that realize Smith is the philosopher to save us (few do if any) have no clout or say so\nThese that are smartest and forced to be silent by those dumber in control, couldn't be able to come to agreement on how to proceed as time is of the essence.\nThe highest intelligence understands that if the American economy (civilization) is to survive it will be by Adam Smith\u2019s system. And this system put into action as Smith himself would is the very system that would solve the global environmental crisis.\nAverage intelligence according to the IQ test designed by so-called genius can whip the intelligence of those selected by proving that we need Smith to bounce back and we need to be true to the system in order to survive the bounce back; we have to have a whole new complex of practical art and Smith is the only way to this.\nThis is as plain as the nose on the face to true intelligence.\nThis monumental pandemic could be a blessing in disguise.

But stereotyping is a shortcut, an inherently lazy way to avoid having to spend the cognitive mental energy to truly look at, and appreciate the unique individuality of, people whom the stereotyper can much more easily categorize into a certain \u201cpigeonhole\u201d based on superficial characteristics, rather than actually getting to know their specific preferences and features as a person.

What are they rooted in? What's the reality?\nTypically, stereotyping is applied to people and groups that are outside of the \u201cin\u201d group of the person doing the stereotyping. There are genuine and universal psychological reasons why this happens, as I discuss in the above linked Quora answer; and everybody does it, not just \u201cwhite folks\u201d against \u201cnon-whites.\u201d But that latter example is what we see most, in a culture that is dominated by the idea of \u201cwhiteness,\u201d a purely social fiction that has no basis in biological reality. There are no sharp dividing lines between \u201cracial\u201d groups, which would clearly place everyone in one of just 3 or 4 particular, defined \u201cboxes;\u201d the genetic diversity in the human species forms a continuum, a rainbow of variations. At the same time, there is no one ethnic group called \u201cwhite;\u201d that is an artificial category which, at any given moment in a racially-based society, consists of that spectrum of separate ethnic groups that this society at that point in time considers to be \u201cwhite.\u201d\nEVERYBODY ELSE is \u201cnon-white\u201d and, rather than being dealt with as individual human beings, is almost universally treated at first glance as having all of the characteristics stereotypically associated with their ethnicity, to the extent the member of the favored class has to deal with them at all.\nAgain, WE ALL do this. It is the structure of society, and the hardwired tendencies of the human brain, that make this the natural, easy choice. But \u201cnatural\u201d does not always mean \u201cright,\u201d and that\u2019s why raising one\u2019s consciousness, or being \u201cwoke\u201d if you prefer, is a prerequisite to recognizing this social tendency and then actually doing something to overcome it. It can be done, but it takes vigilance and effort. It is also possible to change, over time and with even more vigilance and effort, the patterns and structures of society which create this \u201cstructural racism\u201d in the first place.

How? Why?\nPhospofructokinase is an enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, the first part of the respiration reaction. It is an important step in this pathway because it is the main site of regulation - many different things (ATP, AMP, Citrate, Hydrogen ions) regulate this enzyme by binding to one or both of its two sites (once of which is an active site, the other an allosteric or inhibitory site that causes the active site to close).\nEvery cell has a need to make its own ATP. The ATP made in glycolysis (and later by other parts of the respiratory pathway) is used entirely in the cell it is made in. It does not leave the cell it is created in, it just gets used (becoming ADP) and recycled back to the respiration reaction to be remade as more ATP.\nSo the regulation of energy requirements by PFK is a very local affair.\nIf ATP levels get too high in the cell, ATP acts as an inhibitor by binding to the allosteric site on PFK. This is an example of \u2018product feedback\u2019, where the thing the pathway is making is used as an inhibitor in order to avoid wasting resources making more when there is plenty waiting to be used. When ATP levels drop, respiration rate increases and will continue to happen until it again reaches the threshold level where there is too much of it.\nSimilarly, if hydrogen ion concentration rises, for example due to lactic acid build up due to anaerobic exercise, this creates an acidic environment that can be dangerous. So, these ions also work as an inhibitor, stopping respiration until there is enough oxygen to kick off the aerobic steps.\nHowever, all this communication involving PFK is entirely internal. The enzyme itself has no means to communicate anything to any other PFK molecules in other cells. Especially not ones as far apart as the brain and the liver. Each cell regulates the amount of respiraton it performs based on its individual needs, independtly of others.\nInstead, communication indicating a demand for resources is made by other means independent of PFK. For example, an increase in carbon dioxide concentration in blood is taken to mean that there is insufficient oxygen and a need to clear away the excess carbon dioxide. This triggers an increase in breathing rate and heart rate to try to achieve this. Blood glucose sensors in parts of the body also detect when this falls - trigger glucagon release to increase it from stored glycogen in the liver. These systems are all either endocrine (involving hormones secreted into the blood) or nervous (elecrical signals transmitted along nerves). They have nothing to do with PFK other than one of PFK\u2019s precursors in respiration needs glucose to make the product that PFK changes in the pathway."], "topic_list": ["Liver Health", "Livers", "Signal (communications)", "Human Brain", "Neuroscience", "Human Biology", "Psychology", "Human Body", "Science", "Medicine and Healthcare"], "view_list": [974], "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Matt Gailliot", "upvote_list": [0], "question_title": "Does phosphofructokinase in the liver signal to phosphofructokinase in the brain?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "1,121", "name_list": ["David Lascelles"], "date_list": ["Apr 28, 2020"]}, "136": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["The Matrix (creative franchise)", "Matrix Computations", "Matrices (mathematics)", "Cognitive Psychology", "Linear Algebra", "Neuroscience", "Psychology", "Mental Health", "Psychology of Everyday Life", "Computer Programming"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "no_of_follower": 2, "question_author": "Zbigniew Dzwonkowski", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "Is there any definition of a mental matrix program of something as it should be?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "294", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "106": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Doppelganger", "Lookalikes", "Physical Appearances of People", "Attractiveness and Attractive People", "Psychology", "Understanding Emotions", "Emotions", "Human Behavior", "Interpersonal Interaction"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Harman Kang", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "Why do we have an unsettling feeling when we look at someone who looks like us?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "317", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "78": {"ans_list": ["All the theories in Bsc & MSC in Psychology are easy & interesting.\nI'm not scared of any theories in Psychology.", "The existence of mind while no evidence\nalmost all theories it gave birth so far both frauds and junks!\nMilton erection is another joke \u2018post pop-rock\u2019 era"], "topic_list": ["Psychological Theories", "Scariest", "Theory and Theories", "Behavioral Psychology", "Social Psychology", "Fear", "Psychology", "Psychology of Everyday Life", "Philosophy of Everyday Life"], "view_list": [3, 13], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 2, "question_author": "Lijith Lohidhakshan", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "question_title": "What, according to you, is the scariest theory in psychology?", "respond_collected": 2, "no_of_view": "388", "name_list": ["Mehmooda", "Jethro Joshua"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"]}, "90": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["2009 Economic Stimulus Package", "University of Alberta", "Economic Stimulus", "British Columbia, Canada", "Alberta, Canada", "Canada", "Psychology", "Higher Education", "Colleges and Universities", "History"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Shreya Mehta", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "What was the conditioned stimulus in the case of Little Alberta?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "131", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "80": {"ans_list": ["It sounds like you lack confidence, and that\u2019s OK, you just need to be working toward getting more.

You can feel great about yourself but that is not charity as it should be shown. One should do this work because it is necessary to give others a hand up, not to stroke the ego. To use it to stroke the ego is to bring the goodness in one\u2019s self that much lower into selfishness.\nIf someone is wrong, correct them with kindness and respect. To not be kind and respectful, again is a negative thing that will work badly on you than on the person you corrected. Many people innocently want to help, but just don\u2019t have all the facts.\nWhy would anyone want to damage a person who means well? That\u2019s all.

However, you couldn\u2019t be a narcissist or you would not dislike how happy you feel because you would lack empathy. I think your belief is that you showed up someone in a group forum, and because of his status, you think you feel better about yourself.\nWrong. Part of what makes you feel bad about being happy is that you are interpreting the moderator\u2019s reaction to your correction. If he is a famous moderator, then he knows the dangers of misinformation and is glad you corrected him before someone else the next day started posting about it and it circulated in a way that made him embarrassed. So, his professionalism and the fact that the mistake was corrected by 1 and not 3,000 people, probably made him feel better.\nTherefore, a) his feelings are irrelevant\u2014you can\u2019t know what they are, so don\u2019t factor them into your own, b) It is perfectly fine to feel happy because misinformation would have been seen as fact and you prevented that using your ego\u2014a word on the ego.\nFreud identified the Id (drives beneath consciousness, for food, for example), the superego (the part beneath consciousness that absorbed the critical and moral judgments from parents), and the ego (the, hopefully, well-adjusted part of the unconscious that fuels the Self according to learning/development). That \u201cego\u201d is derived from, \u201cegotistical,\u201d gives it a conceited meaning, but in much of Psychology, it just stands for the Self\u2014the part of you that is unique.\nAlso, Freud identified the conscious, the preconscious, and the unconscious, but he did not write about the subconscious. The subconscious is a dictionary word, I do not know if increased usage got it into some Psychological writing, but to my knowledge, it is not a word in Psychology.\nFinally, a lot in life is competition, a lot just seems that way. If you corrected the error and felt good about it, then you can chalk that up to having a good self-esteem. If you think the moderator was crushed by your correction, then that would be egotistical. It is probably not the first time it\u2019s happened to him, and hopefully\u2014with your help[ful correction\u2014it will be the last time.\nAllow yourself your feelings, especially when you have reason to congratulate yourself.

The new outcomes were pretty much dependent on the children\u2019s background and household conditions.\nThe poor children have generally no surety whether they will eat food tomorrow or not as their pantry gets vacate every day. They feel that whatever they have now, at least eat that, what\u2019s the chances that it will not vanish tomorrow. This mindset somehow leads to them eat the first marshmallow before 15 minutes.\nOn the other hand, affluent children know that their parents are financially stable, the pantry will get filled by tomorrow.

However, if the child decided to eat the first one before the researcher came back, then they would not get a second marshmallow.\nSo the choice was simple: one treat right now or two treats later.\nThe researcher left the room for 15 minutes.\nAs you can imagine, the footage of the children waiting alone in the room was rather entertaining. Some kids jumped up and ate the first marshmallow as soon as the researcher closed the door. Others wiggled and bounced and scooted in their chairs as they tried to restrain themselves, but eventually gave in to temptation a few minutes later. And finally, a few of the children did manage to wait the entire time.\nThe intersting part came years later.\nAs the years rolled on and the children grew up, the researchers conducted follow up studies and tracked each child's progress in a number of areas. What they found was surprising.\nThe children who were willing to delay gratification and waited to receive the second marshmallow ended up having higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, better social skills as reported by their parents, and generally better scores in a range of other life measures.\nAnd if you look around, you\u2019ll see this playing out everywhere\u2026\nIf you delay the gratification of watching television and get your homework done now, then you\u2019ll learn more and get better grades.\nIf you delay the gratification of buying desserts and chips at the store, then you\u2019ll eat healthier when you get home.\nIf you delay the gratification of finishing your workout early and put in a few more reps, then you\u2019ll be stronger.\n\u2026 and countless other examples.", "Don't waste your time with it, the era from the 50\u2032s to the 70's was a time of pseudo science and precarious ethics."], "topic_list": ["Walter Mischel (psychologist)", "Maria Konnikova", "The Marshmallow Test", "Marshmallows", "Marshmallow (Android 6.0)", "Cognitive Psychology", "Behavioral Psychology", "Social Psychology", "Psychology", "Psychology of Everyday Life", "Human Behavior", "Exams and Tests"], "view_list": [28, 55, 71, 35], "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Rohit Chavan (\u0930\u094b\u0939\u093f\u0924 \u091a\u0935\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0923)", "upvote_list": [0, 1, 1, 1], "question_title": "What is the marshmallow test?

The brain is indeed quantum system, but so does every phone and laptop there is. Being a quantum system doesn't mean that the relevant behavior of the system relies on quantum statistical rules. After receiving its input a laptop then processes it by sending it over a series of logic gates that are doing classical \u201cAnd/Or\u201d operations. Off course, the activity of those logic gates is sustained by quantum behavior, but at the \"macro\" level of organization it nonetheless takes the form of a classical pattern. This can also be true for our brain. In fact, some argue that we couldn't function otherwise. We are beings that confront a classical environment, following classical rules, so our brain better be performing classical statistics to apraise situations and make decisions. So no wonder, most of the researchers on animal behavior, neuroscience and human cognition think that the brain is an organization specially tailored to filter out any quantum randomness (well, the quantum realm might be deterministic, we don't know yet, but it does manifest itself as \"randomness acting on a set of probabilities\").\nBut there are situations where psychology has a hard time explaining human decision-making and some researchers want to elucidate the mystery by using a quantum statistical framework.\nImagine you're placing bets on whether a tossed coin will land on heads or tails. Heads gets you $200, tails costs you $100, and you can choose to toss the coin twice. When placed in this scenario, most people choose to take the bet twice regardless of whether the initial throw results in a win or a loss, according to a study published in 1992 in the journal Cognitive Psychology. Presumably, winners bet a second time because they stand to gain money no matter what, while losers bet in attempt to recover their losses, and then some. However, if players aren't allowed to know the result of the first coin flip, they rarely make the second gamble.\nWhen known, the first flip does not sway the choice that follows, but when unknown, it makes all the difference. This paradox does not fit within the framework of classical reinforcement learning, which predicts that the objective choice should always be the same. In contrast, quantum mechanics takes uncertainty into account and actually predicts this odd outcome.\n\"One could say that the 'quantum-based' model of decision-making refers essentially to the use of quantum probability in the area of cognition,\" Emmanuel Haven and Andrei Khrennikov, co-authors of the textbook \"Quantum Social Science\" (Cambridge University Press, 2013), told Live Science in an email.\nSource: What is quantum cognition? Physics theory could predict human behavior.\nPersonally i'm not too eager to find out what is the truth in this matter because whatever it is.. it wouldn't change how i behave or how my neighbor does. The result is what matters and i\u2019m already living it :)\nBut there are two things in which i'm interested that also have to do with the mind and quantum mechanics.\nThe first is only a metaphorical link between the two and it's the insight of an american psychologist (i'm sorry i can't remember the name) who saw that our psyche kinda looks quantumy. At any given moment there are a lot of things going around inside our vast unconscious (some of them going against each other), each having a certain probability of \"spilling over\" into our consciousness and manifesting as an act (a memory, a thought, an emotion, a choice, bodily movement \u200a-\u200a anything we can objectively observe). The probabilities for each act to emerge are given by our genes, fetal development, life experiences and education. This way of seeing ourselves can be helpful because it can make us aware to our predispositions and to the fact that if we want certain outcomes with respect to our behavior we must act in such a way to bias these implicit probabilities. For example, what a cognitive behavioral therapist essentially does is playing with the patient's unconscious predisposition, making some things less and other things more probable given certain contexts (instead of fear and negative thoughts when you have to give a talk in public, you train yourself to be much more likely to manifest confidence). Another thing i liked about this view was the fact that its proponent said that beneath our sets of probabilities we have a fundamental realm of possibility, meaning that we can feel totally novel things (this resonated with me because i feel best when i have subtle new experiences i never had). Here, a new way forward opens up for psychological work \u200a-\u200a one in which we practice and orient ourselves so to be more flexible, less caught in routine and more open to novel esthetics. And why not: open to transcendence.\nThe second thing about our mind and the quantum is just at the level of wild conjecture, having many more ways to be wrong than right. But i find its possibility fascinating. One fundamental mystery that haunts us more and more is consciousness. What is it? What is it for? Are these even the right questions to ask about it? The truth is that nobody knows, but we have quite a few (very different) hypotheses. One possible explanation regarding consciousness is that we evolved it because it massively enhanced our ability to respond to the environment (so this has to do with your original question). This is because conscious minds appear to be able to hold many things in the same time. When i look around me i can appraise at a single glance that there are many angry individuals approaching me with bad intent. And this isn't limited to the visual modality; everything is integrated at once \u200a-\u200a for instance: i see how tall the step is and in the same time i feel the pain in my knee and the weakness in my muscles, allowing for a very fast appraisal of my overall situation and a very fast and easy decision. So from our subjective 1st person view we have a big unified experience. How could that be possible, since there's nothing in the physical world that can \"join\" various bits into a single entity? How can a brain made of classical macroscopic functional bits (neurons, or synapses made of molecules - depending how you look at it) give rise to a seamless entity? The only thing in physics that comes close to match such a requirement is quantum entanglement. When quantum systems get entangled, irrespective of how many there are, they become a single unitary system, having a joined evolution. So what if what we are (our \"soul\") is a massive quantum entangled part of the brain? Well, that looks impossible. Given the wet and hot environment inside the skull (37 degrees is an immense temperature as far as quantum coherence is concerned) any entanglement breaks down in a matter of femtoseconds, nowhere near the necessary tens or hundreds of seconds (which is how long our conscious experience is said to last, until it gives rise to the next conscious moment). To understand just how impossible it looks you have to understand how small a femtosecond is\u200a -\u200a one femtosecond is to one second what a second is to 32 million years! And still.. from a certain perspective, entanglement remains our best option. Only two decades ago physicists believed that no biological organism can harness the principle of entanglement and then, a series of findings proved them wrong. From photosynthesis in plants to navigation in migratory birds, there are various functions that are achieved through the exploitation of quantum entanglement. And, as an even bigger surprise, there are some hints that certain phosphorus atoms in our brains can maintain quantum coherence for long periods of time \u200a-\u200a A New Spin on the Quantum Brain | Quanta Magazine\n. Admittedly this doesn't change my predicament, but if it's true (and it's testable) it would have momentous implications about the nature of reality.", "Those who subscribe to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, I am sure would say yes.\nIf an every-day animate object, such as a cat, exists in cloud-like state of multiple probabilities, until observation collapses it to a definite state, then the mind of the observer obviously interfaces with the external evironment. That\u2019s the implication. This means that consciousness is not reactive to the external environment, but a force that shapes it.\nThis may bring to mind the New Age aphorism \u2018You create your own reality\u2019 and the Law of Attracton, but it is also associated with Confirmation Bias, which is pure mainstream psychology.\nSo the reason why we see what we want to see, or what we expect, is not because of biased memory and wishful thinking, but because our minds rig the future and cause the present to conform to our expectations.\nProduced using SpeechToText PRO\n.", "It\u2019s extremely unlikely.

The quarks that make up the baryons, and mesons and leptons give rise to atoms and atomic structures, molecules, which in turn form the basis of organic chemistry necessary for life.

Even if the Minar was commenced by Ghori, its name ought to have been \u2018GHORI MINAR\u2019 and not \u2018QUTB MINAR\u2019. Why is it called \u2018Qutb Minar\u2019 ?\nA. It was probably Qutubuddin Aibak, slave of Ghori, who laid the foundation of the minar for his master.\nQ. If this is true, what made him choose Delhi as the site for the Victory Tower?\nA. Delhi was the capital of Qutbuddin Aibak.\nQ. It is said that the building of the Minar was commenced during the life time of Ghori. When Ghori was alive, the question of his slave\u2019s capital being at Delhi does not arise. After the death of Ghori, Qutbuddin was crowned at Sultan at Lahore. He ruled from Lahore and not Delhi and ultimately died at Lahore. His capital was at Lahore ? Why did he build the Victory Tower at Delhi ?\nA. Silence.\nSomebody from the audience asserted that the Minar was not a victory tower but a \u2018Mazina\u2019 (Muezzin\u2019s Tower in mosque) attached to \u2018Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque\u2019.\nQ. The word \u2018Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque\u2019 is unknown to contemporary history of India. This word was coined by Sir Saiyid Ahmad Khan in the first part of the nineteeth century. Do not be surprised to know that the name \u2018QUTB MINAR\u2019 too, is not known to Indian History. It is also a recent fabrication. If, for the sake of argument, we take it for granted that the minar is a muezzin\u2019s tower, the mosque assumes primary importance and the tower secondary, but unfortunately the mosque, as you see it, is in complete ruins. How do you account for the mosque of primary importance to be in ruins and the muezzin\u2019s tower, a building of no consequence, to be standing in full majesty ?\nA. No Answer.\n\u2018Masjid & Mazina\u2019 with regard to the Qutb Minar is a \u201cCOCK & BULL STORY\u201d. The so called Qutb Minar and the ruined Jama Masjid close by cannot be ascribed to the same builder. The Qutb Minar is a much older tower.\nQuranic inscriptions on the Minar\nThe Quranic inscriptions on the Minar are forced and lifeless insertions between forceful and beautiful frieze-bands of the pure HINDU DESIGN. To consider the minar of Moslem origin from the Quranic inscriptions would be labelling a non-Muslim as a Mussalman because circumcision has been forced on him.\nThe Dhruv Stambha\nThe pillars of Shri Vishnu Temple, just adjacent to the Dhruv Stambh (Qutub Minar), illuminated at night\nThe Minar is in fact the Dhurva Stambha or the central observation tower of an ancient Hindu Astronomical Observatory. Fig. 1 is based on observation from a two seater aeroplane made to hover over the top of the DHRUVA STAMBHA. The tower looks like a 24-petalled lotus flower (Fig. 2), each petal representing an \u201cHORA\u201d, i.e., an hour on a 24-hour dial (Fig. 3). Vertical projection lines drawn from the mid points of stone-flutings on the top of each storey of the tower to the horizontal plane at its base create a lotus flower similar to what can be seen from the sky over the top of the tower \u2013 bottom fig. 1. (Note : Please refer below scanned pages for reference of figures mentioned in this paragraph)\nFig. 1\nFig. 2\nFig. 3\nThe 24-petalled architectural lotus flower is purely a Hindu concept. It cannot be attributed to any Moslem king from dry parts of Western Asia where lotuses do not grow.\nYou are the proud possessor of the \u2018LOTUS\u2019 projection of the DHRUVA STAMBHA which is the result of original thinking, perseverance and expense. Such a projection was neither drawn nor conceived by any architect or archaeologist in the past. Let any body come forward and challenge the statement. Now, you can reasonably silence all those who believe the DHRUVA STAMBHA to be a production of Md. Ghori or Qutbuddin Aibak. Sultans associated with this \u2018Minar\u2019 defiled its casing, reversed stones bearing human or animal figures and inserted Arabic Inscriptions. These Sultans can, of course, be praised for not making any claim that they built the \u2018Minar\u2019. No body has left any inscription asserting that he started the Minar.\nPART 2 : Its origins\nAbout the Qutub Minar itself...(more)", "Please visit\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/19760930-qutab-minar-was-not-originally-a-hindu-monument-say-experts-819348-2015-04-11"], "topic_list": ["Qutb Minar (Monument in New Delhi, India)", "Human Psychology", "Monuments", "Controversies", "Delhi", "Historical India", "Architecture", "Mumbai, Maharashtra, India", "New Delhi", "Psychology", "History", "India"], "view_list": [37, 15], "create_time": "Jul 27, 2019", "no_of_follower": 2, "question_author": "Siddharth Das", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "question_title": "What are some controversies of Qutub Minar?", "respond_collected": 2, "no_of_view": "605", "name_list": ["Rani", "Dhanush Dhari Misra"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Oct 21, 2019"]}, "95": {"ans_list": ["Systemic inflammatoryresponse syndrome (SIRS) is an exaggerated defense response of the body to a noxious stressor (infection, trauma, surgery, acuteinflammation, ischemia or reperfusion, or malignancy to name a few) to localize and then eliminate the endogenous or exogenous source of the insult"], "topic_list": ["Anti-inflammatory Supplements", "Inflammation", "Medical Terminology", "Medical Symptoms", "Psychology", "Medical Conditions and Diseases", "Health", "Medicine and Healthcare"], "view_list": [165], "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Chirag Hingu (\u091a\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0917 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0917\u0941)", "upvote_list": [1], "question_title": "What is inflammatory syndrome?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "938", "name_list": ["RV Mythily"], "date_list": ["Apr 28, 2020"]}, "500": {"ans_list": ["Not at all.

It wasn\u2019t meant as criticism of her choices and I stated so, but I did want her to see other options were possible. Perhaps she saw this as criticism where none was intended.

Different events that has happened triggers empathy and compassion.\nFor example, a generic plot line goes like this: A person has a fulfilling job, he/she has children with profound sentimental value because it is highly intimate, and he/she have had many experiences that were blissful, but suddenly, a specific \u2018force\u2019 may it be supernatural or realistic have affected his/her life profoundly, which resulted to everything that he/she has attained to suddenly vanish.

Kleptomania is considered a mental illness, but if you get caught stealing and try using this as an excuse, you most likely will still have some sort of punishment. If the judge is very sympathetic and you have an \u201cexpert witness\u201d like a psychologist in your corner, it is possible to get a reduced level of punishment (so long as you agree to mandatory treatment for your illness). Pyromania may be much harder to \u201cexcuse\u201d due to how devastating fire setting could be to property not to mention possibly human life! In the case of murder, you need to pretty much prove that you were under the influence from a full blown psychosis, such as in mania or schizophrenia, which essentially means you did not realize at the time that what you were doing was wrong. For instance, a paranoid schizophrenic in psychosis who truly believes a random person was actually an alien trying to kill him, which lead him to believe his life was in danger. Good luck proving it, though\u2026it is very difficult.

Yet, he is completely in control of what happens to you and being omnipotent, he either makes the things that you do happen, or has made it difficult for you to avoid doing such things\u2014when he could have made it so much easier, right? He didn\u2019t have to make human 5.0 so incapable of controlling their baser urges did he?\nSo, this paradox was on my mind for a number of years, until it became clear to me that there was no god of christianity or islam, or whatever. It was simply evidentially impossible, based on the dogma each religion presents. Also, when I stopped attributing mere accidental occurrences to godly interference; it became painfully obvious that the only basis or rationale for what happened around me \u2014was physics. \u2014And don\u2019t get me started on how rotten much of the world is considering it was made in earnest by a being that is \u201call good.\u201d\nSo, suffice it to say the glut of contradictions in the explanations for reality I was hearing around me challenged my trust in my parents, my country; as well as logic, common sense, etc. Losing faith when everyone around me believed so passionately was not something to do lightly. Once I understood more about human nature and that we are, indeed, animals\u2014as much as we try to pretend we aren\u2019t, it became much less of a stretch to believe there was no \u201cguiding light.\u201d As a matter of fact, it was more like \u201cwell, that figures\u2026.\u201d\nSo, for some young people, I think obsessing about the religious memes you hear and are asked to digest is unavoidable.

If this is the case, the problem is a neuro-biological one which will require cognitive-behavioral therapy to treat. Your religious leader or counselor may not be able to help, because the problem goes beyond normal theological concerns. The root cause is pathological, rather than philosophical.

We have had years of being told we are crazy, we are delusional and we are the ones that make things up. Truth is we never were.

I've seen an ex of mine try. It just won't work because the answers to these questions when answered correctly are endorsed by other victims.\nCall it a victimhood, brotherhood or whatever you want to call us.

I am currently 42. Until recently, my interactions with my family were so prohibitively painful that I avoided them in as much as I could. The reasons run a long, painful gamut that probably doesn\u2019t need detailing here, as what I care to share already exists in a lot of my other answers.\nI\u2019ve spent the last few years spending rather a lot more time with them than I intended to, and they have been helpful, though it has not been without some rather toxic dysfunction.\nI am actually grateful for the time I\u2019ve spent with them in many ways, not the least of which because their help prevented me from being homeless again, recently.\nThe problem with being abused as a child, or one of them, is that a parent is\u2026 a representative of authority to a child. If not their god, then like gods to them: a center for the life of a child, a model for behavior, the source of their sustenance and nurturing. The first and primary lessons a child learns about themselves stem from that relationship. Children know themselves in many ways through that relationship, which goes on to have a profound effect on their relationship with others, from authority figures (like bosses) to their religious feelings to their romantic relationships.\nI learned of my parents when I was a child that they were gods: remote, distant, absorbed in their own pain and problems, and disinterested in my welfare or cruel as the mood took them. I learned that I was nothing and less than nothing, that no one in their right mind could ever love me and the most I could ever hope for was to be used, temporarily.\nIt should suffice to say that I found young adulthood difficult, given the lessons I had absorbed. And sadly, I was not as good as I should have been about not sharing those lessons with others.\nReturning as an adult to spend time with them has been illuminating. They have become people\u2014foolish, on occasion kind, deeply flawed, and profoundly afraid of change and strangers. They live in what is almost a time capsule to an imagined 1960s and their childhoods. A harking back to a time that I know, because I went to family to ask questions, did not actually exist.\nThey dwindled as they became human. I was shocked to find out that I am almost as tall as my father, now that my full growth has found me. I remember him so much bigger, so much more menacing.\nIt was a shock to me to find out that some of their most impulsively cruel behaviors toward me made sense, in a roundabout way. If you believe someone is evil, if they can be made a vessel for all the things you fear, then what you do is less cruelty and more about making gestures toward rejection in the guise of discipline.\nI understand what they did. I disagree, but I can see the reasoning they used.\nI look at them and see their discomfort with me, their need to be right. I see their flailing about trying to be free of me and the ideas they think I represent. I see their tortured feelings of duty toward me and the ways they try to be free of it.\nI see my own anger\u2014rage, let\u2019s be honest. I see my own cruelties and the malice of a painful and thwarted childhood. I see the ways I projected out my pain and made it the problem of others.\nI look at them and see my own rationalizations, the ways I have been cruel and rejected others, the things I have done to avoid closeness with others, and the ways I have had to be right.\nAs they have become smaller, I have become more multidimensional. Not just angry, though I have certainly been that, but also loving and kind and capable of the things they told me I could not be.\nI see their attempts at love, though I would not call it that. We differ in how we would define it and what it means.\nI see their kindnesses and how difficult it is for them. I\u2019m touched that they try. I am grateful, though again, we differ on what that means. We really don\u2019t have much in the way of family ties, that they should bother with me.\nThe worst part about the things our families can hold against us is our suspicion that they are right. And now that we are both human, I can see their reasoning and it does not matter.\nI can see why I will never be what I believe myself to be, to them.\nThey bully on occasion. They querulously demand their rights, the obedience they think they are owed out of gratitude for any help they might give me before disgustedly exclaiming that I have no feelings, since it does not work, or prophesying dire events to come from me, my actions, and my lifestyle.\nThey live in a narrow, careful, anxious little world that I can no longer inhabit, though I don\u2019t think I ever inhabited it well. Down to my soul, I am simply not the right kind of person for that place. Conformity is not one of my virtues, though I no longer generally rebel nor have any particular problem with authority.\nI am what I am. I can be nothing else.\nIt has been interesting watching them, and watching myself as we change. I am torn between amusement and irritation\u2014it is easy to see where they are wrong, it is annoying that they insist, and it is what I have come to expect, a long-running joke about my own stubbornness.\nI still find myself shaking with tension when they yell, remembering being hit. But they do not hit, nor would they risk it now that I am an adult.\nOnce I thought them invincibly strong. And now I can see their weaknesses and my own, the fear covered up by arrogance.\nThey anger me, but I also feel sympathy. Truly, they suffer. And truly, I have suffered.\nI do not see us having enough in common to keep much of a relationship. But if it makes any sense, when I finally stop communicating, it won\u2019t be because I am angry. I left that behind as we both became human.\nIt\u2019s hard to be angry at someone when you have things in common with them.\nI will simply stop talking because I am satisfied that I cannot be heard, because I am satisfied that all our interactions will end up the same. It\u2019s not good for any of us to fall into these patterns.\nI was lonely. Now I am not. Perhaps I will be called on occasion, or be talked to, but the need for them to be what I wish they had been is gone\u2014not with a bang, as it started, but in what feels like an understanding silence.\nI accept. No rage, no gesture, no storm of emotion could buy me what I once wanted. I cannot yell at them and make them love me, nor can I hold against them that they cannot love me as I wish they would.\nI accept and I let go of the expectations, the desires, the attempt to make them see me as I wish they would.\nI accept and I forgive myself.\nAnd finally, it is peaceful.", "When people don\u2019t have loving supportive parents, they find loving supportive friends.\nThere is nothing to miss.

Through this I saw just how toxic my relationship with my mother was. Every single issue I had in my relationship boiled down to her.\nI couldn\u2019t apologize to anybody. Mom used to force me to apologize to her after SHE hurt me. I wouldn\u2019t get my privileges back if I didn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t become ungrounded until I said I\u2019m sorry and \u201cmeant it\u201d. For 25 years I couldn\u2019t apologize because of her.\nI would throw tantrums. Mom used to scream and yell over the smallest things and blow them way out of proportion. One time the outside cat slipped inside while I was feeding him so she dumped a cup of water on my head. (Then I had to apologize as described in #1). She showed me how to act irrationally and that\u2019s what I did in my relationships. If I didn\u2019t get MY way, I\u2019d throw a tantrum.\nShe would sweep things under the rug; pretend none of it ever happened. Act like just yesterday she didn\u2019t sit me on a kitchen stool and beat me with the wooden spoon. So I became someone who FORCED everything out in the open. Yes, you WILL tell me how you feel. No, you can\u2019t escape me! I would text incessantly in order to get what I wanted because I needed closure. We were NOT going to pretend nothing happened!!!\nThe list goes on and on, you get the point. I despised my mother. I stopped talking to her when I went to college, and suddenly a weight was lifted off my shoulders. No more of the rollercoaster that is my mother. No more fights, no more tears, no more wishing I was dead. She couldn\u2019t hurt me anymore, that toxic relationship was over! I never grieved her to be honest, I think I did that as a child. I knew early on I hated her because of the abuse. Life was better without her.\nSix years later my dad died unexpectedly. My best friend, my confidante. Mom came back into my life and I think missing those years changed her. She\u2019s different now. She still is a rollercoaster, but she is more compassionate and caring than I can ever remember. It\u2019s as if she now realizes how important family is and how short this life can be.\nShe grew. I grew. Separately. And now together. We just needed space to do so.\nI encourage you to take the time and space you need. In order to mentally stay stable, you have to be selfish. Bottom line. That\u2019s okay, though.

For a brief moment, the best care available would be given(please note that the \u201cbest\u201d care available was pretty poor until relatively recently). The public and politicians would lose interest. Mental health would again become a backwater, budgets would be cut, hostile laws passed, and existent institutions would become storehouses for the unwanted, staffed too often by the \u201ccream of the crap.\u201d That last phrase was a quote from a hospital director. The staff, given the low pay and terrible working conditions, were too often drunks, rapists, criminals, and failures in every other job. In the 1960s, given the drug revolution of the 60s and a growing social conscience, we started \u201cdeinstitutionalization-\u201d the closing of the hospitals.

By this time, the deinstitutionalization movement had released those who were thought able to live on their own with support services. Wikipedia does a decent job on this topic.\nDeinstitutionalisation - Wikipedia\nOff topic, but when I graduated from nursing school in 1976, mental illness was mostly thought to be caused by bad mothering!\nThere were 3 major reasons for the change: (1) hope that the new anti-psychotic meds (thorazine the first around 1955) that mental patients took meant they could live a \u2018Normal\u2019 life outside the institution, (2) Movements seeking more humane treatment of mental illness and (3) money. It costs less to house people outside an institution.\nThe aides at the state mental hospital told me that the sensationalized stories like \u2018One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u2019 did not exist at their hospital. Some hospitals were bad, but probably only a small percent.\nThere was a dormitory like building where the chronically ill e.g. schizophrenics lived. They had a guaranteed place to stay, food to each, staff who understood them as much as possible. The patients had a job like mowing the lawn to keep them busy and have a purpose in life. IMHO better than living on the streets often homeless.\nSome things not planned on: patients would stop taking their meds, partly understandable because the early psychotropics had some nasty side effects. Often they would self-mediate with drugs and/or alcohol. They went to bars because that\u2019s an easy way to meet people. The medications were helpful, but didn\u2019t completely make a person able to live well in outside society.

But if we can get cover for ignoring people who make us uncomfortable \u2014 and medicalize them and say they are sick and need medical care, then we can feel we were caring in releasing them from prison into community based treatment, and it was the treatment system that failed them. Not our responsibility.\nWell, the only way we can deal effectively with this problem is if we accept that we are all responsible for all of us and we stop passing these so-called \u201csick\u201d people off on the medical system. And the only way to do that is to stop calling them \u201csick\u201d and accept that they are normal people we can all help care for, and that it is our responsibility to care for them. If we stop gaslighting them, and start accepting them as normal citizens, we can eliminate the \u201cproblem,\u201d be more humane, and get better outcomes for all of us.\nSeparation is not the answer. Inclusion is the answer. All we have to do is go a little bit out of our way and become a bit more tolerant. But that\u2019s a tough sell because it requires people to work a little harder and be a bit more mentally tolerant. However, maybe all these people\u2019s experience with the harm of isolation due to the pandemic may have a bit more understanding that mental illness is not illness but quite common because a lot of people are isolated, even when there isn\u2019t a pandemic. Isolation happens in so many different ways.", "Along with the civil rights movement and deinstitutionalization came a shift in the legal standard for civil commitment away from a need-for-treatment model to a dangerousness model. In 1964, Washington, DC, instituted a standard for civil commitment that established that a person must be determined to have a mental illness before he or she could be hospitalized against his or her will. Second, the person had to pose an imminent threat to the safety of him- or herself or others or be shown to be \u201cgravely disabled,\u201d meaning that he or she could not provide for the necessities for basic survival.\nIn the 1950\u2019s and early 60\u2019s people were housed in horrible conditions in state hospitals. Very little money was spent in the care of people housed there. When states had to start spending huge sums of money to house mentally ill people the drop off in patient population was astounding. The number of psychiatric inpatients declined from a high of more than 550,000 in 1950 to 30,000 by the 1990s. In the state of Colorado one year in the state hospital (CMHIP) apparently costs about $190,000 per patient.

My mom has always told me that I was a well-behaved child and never needed any punishment aside from the occasional slap on the behind if I talked back, which I guess was rare. My younger sister on the other hand, she was a HANDFUL. I remember clear as day, she threw tantrums constantly to the point where my mom had to take her to a child psychologist. She recommended that, instead of physical punishments (as they had gotten my parents nowhere) to put my sister in her room, close the door, but not to lock it. She would scream and cry and yell for about 10 minutes, and either fall asleep, or come out and apologize. I don't know the psychological stuff behind it but it had to do with the kid letting their anger out and getting time to think for themselves. After about a week, if that, the tantrums decreased dramatically! If slowed to maybe once a week, to once a month, to rare occasions. My sister is 13 now and hasn't thrown any type of tantrum in years. Being locked in a closet for a certain amount of time won't solve anything, and there's a chance it could only make things worse. Instead, take him to his room, make him sit on his bet, walk out and close the door. Let him come out in his own time or tire himself out and fall asleep. He'll figure out that it isn't getting him anywhere and in time, he'll stop. He may even do what my sister did and apologize to you!\nBest wishes!!\nTaylor :)", "Of course no one can predict psychological effects of that kind of behavior.

At first it was mild and I discounted it as \u2018misplaced emotion,\u2019 but over the years it has grown and it reached fever pitch just before the virus hit.\nI can\u2019t say exactly what it is or what purpose it serves, but I can say that it seems to be an emotion borne of \u2018changing times\u2019. Times are changing rapidly. And I don\u2019t mean just in the usual sense where world orders shift (as has happened when Rome fell, Britain lost its empire, WW1 and 2, etc), I mean there is a change going on which runs all the way up to the subtle and spiritual realms. And strange mixed up feelings are a reaction to that.\nTo me, it\u2019s almost like some of us sense that there will be many casualties with the cosmic changes which, I think, have actually started now. And it\u2019s almost like we don\u2019t want to get too close to anyone whom we aren\u2019t already close to. The way a soldier off to battle might be hesitant to develop relationships with too many of his comrades, for obvious reasons. We seem to intuitively understand that we\u2019re entering a survival period where all our resources will be needed for us to care to those closest to us now, and adding to the pool just doesn\u2019t make sense at this time. But then we feel strange, guilty, stupid for \u2018not wanting to feel connections with people\u2019, because, well, consciously we see that nothing major is happening, so we think, \u201cWhy am I being so distant from others?\u201d\nAside from this, many of the more spiritual people on earth right now are having serious internal struggles. ( you know what I\u2019m talking about). Sometimes it seems like the very forces of good and evil are taking place within our very souls. Yes, you\u2019re not alone in this. I have been having these internal battles for over a decade now. And trust me, our ancestors didn\u2019t do this the way we do. They accepted themselves as either good, somewhat good, not to good, or evil, and that was that. But we feel a call to grow beyond what we\u2019ve been in a way which hasn\u2019t happened to humanity (aside from saints here and there). So, nwhen undergoing this inner battle, again, you need resources and are thus reluctant to connect with others. hence the surge of dread and dissociation. But since you aren\u2019t a bad person, you feel guilty afterwards and don\u2019t quite understand your actions and thoughts.\nFinally. We sense that others are undergoing deep changes as well. And many of them are losing, or will lose, to the darkness. We are afraid to invest in the wrong people as they will only drag us down with them. This is the final reason for that strange \u2018reticence then dread to connect with others\u2019.\nAs you progress spiritually, you will become good at knowing when another person is worth the connection though. And many many people truly are worth it! But until you master the ability to see this in others, it\u2019s normal not to connect. Part of the new spiritual change is a \u2018deeper capacity for connection and empathy\u2019 with others. Empathy is becoming such that for many people, it will be like as if you are one with the person you connect with. But if you connect with, let\u2019s say, an evil person, then you risk becoming like them for awhile, possibly being scarred for knowing their dark thoughts, and at best, you will have spent time and energy on somewhat unworthy of it."], "topic_list": ["Conscience", "Sensation", "Psychology", "Understanding Emotions", "Emotions", "Experiences in Life", "Human Behavior"], "view_list": [32, 104], "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "no_of_follower": 4, "question_author": "Sirron Rehpotsirhc", "upvote_list": [2, 4], "question_title": "What's this surreal new sensation/emotion (I can't place it)?

There is a theory called Panpsychism that posits all matter in the universe has some form of base consciousness, from the single atom to the highly complex human brain\u2014and this includes organic and inorganic matter.\nSo we don\u2019t know, and we\u2019re not likely to have answers to this age-old question. For now, the important question for us as individuals is \u201cwhat do we do with our consciousness?\u201d\nUse it. Expand it. Enjoy the hell out of it. Because whether it fired up when your brain formed and will wither and send you into nothingness upon your death, or whether it is a pervasive force that connects you with the universe and will allow you to evolve beyond physical death, it\u2019s all you got.\nGardner Eeden, author of Lucid: Awake in the World and the Dream", "It is very similar to computer hardware and software.
