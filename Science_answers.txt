These discharges can be spread by particular species of flies.\nKey facts\nTrachoma is a disease of the eye caused by infection with the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis.\nIt is a public health problem in 44 countries, and is responsible for the blindness or visual impairment of about 1.9 million people.\nBlindness from trachoma is irreversible.\nBased on March 2019 data, 142 million people live in trachoma endemic areas and are at risk of trachoma blindness.\nInfection spreads through personal contact (via hands, clothes or bedding) and by flies that have been in contact with discharge from the eyes or nose of an infected person. With repeated episodes of infection over many years, the eyelashes may be drawn in so that they rub on the surface of the eye, with pain and discomfort and permanent damage to the cornea.\nThe elimination strategy is summarized by the acronym \"SAFE\", which means Surgery for advanced disease, Antibiotics to clear C. trachomatis infection, Facial cleanliness and Environmental improvement to reduce transmission.\nThe World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA51.11 in 1998, targeting the global elimination of trachoma as a public health problem.\nIn 2018, 146 112 people received surgical treatment for advanced stage of the disease, and 89.1 million people were treated with antibiotics.

A bacterium called Chlamydia trachomatis causes trachoma. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), trachoma has caused the visual impairment of 1.8 million people. Of those people, 450 thousand are irreversibly blind.\nIn its early stages, trachoma causes conjunctivitis (pink eye). Early symptoms begin to appear within five to 12 days of exposure to the bacterium. These symptoms can include:\nmild itching and irritation of the eyes and eyelids, and\na discharge from the eyes\nAs the infection progresses, it causes eye pain and blurred vision. If the infection is untreated, scarring occurs inside the eyelid. This leads to the eyelashes turning inward toward the eye. This condition is called trichiasis. The eyelashes brush and scratch against the cornea, the clear, dome-shaped window at the front of the eye. This continual irritation turns the cornea cloudy.

For example, I earned 3 degrees in English and American literature back in the early 1970s. (That\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019t recommend for any student these days, BTW.)\nFor my Master\u2019s, I became fascinated with the use of \u201cconcordances,\u201d reference works that list word usage and frequency in the works of major authors. Scholars can sometimes use concordances as a tool for discovering thought and usage patterns of writers. And sometimes they can use them to prove or disprove whether an unattributed story, play or poem was actually written by the author and not forged by someone else.\nThe way scholars assembled concordances back in the day was painful. They used index cards for cataloguing each word as they went through an author\u2019s work or works. I came up with the bright idea of trying to use a computer (of which I knew nothing about at the time) to do all the sorting of the data. So, for my Masters thesis, I established a methodology for doing this. And, working with a friend in the computer science department, fashioned a relatively simple program for inputting the data and creating a concordance. The final product was a sample concordance of a simple book. I input each word on a punch card, and eventually processed the project via the university\u2019s mainframe computer. (There were no PCs in those days, although they were only a few years in the future.)\nI learned a lot about computers in the process, but figured I\u2019d never need this knowledge again. Wrong answer. After giving up on an academic career (which was and has been a real dead-ender for humanities degree holders) and wandering through a few possible career paths, I ended up being hired as a technical writer for a defense firm. They hired me not for my computer knowledge, but for my writing ability and at least passing knowledge of mainframe computing, saying that there was no such thing as a technical writer in the early 1980s, so the next best thing was for them to find an excellent writer who could learn quickly.\nSo, in a weird way, English lit and science combined to create a new career for me and a lot of others. While it didn\u2019t exist as a discipline in the early 1980s when I made this career move, technical writing is a degree specialty offered by any number of English departments today.\nThis is one example of harmonic convergence in careers. There are others. But the key is, you need an inquisitive mind and a curiosity about business and life in general to spot opportunities like this. They aren\u2019t particularly common, but I hope my story here gives you an idea of the possibilities.\nBut in a pinch, I\u2019d still get that STEM degree before doing anything else these days!", "I am a biologist and I find history and geography to be very useful to put things in context.

In each phase, I will consider the type of volunteers, their number, and the time it takes.\nPhase 1:\nThe vaccine is first tested on dozens of people and this number of people should be healthy.

If all goes well here, then move to the next phase.\nPhase 3:\nThousands of people are taken for this phase and that too from the area with virus outbreak. In this case, the area will be Wuhan china or its adjoining cities. If there is no problem in this phase too, then the matter moves forward. It is said that this data of all the tests go to any drug regulatory body.\nThe Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) in India is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the US. These organizations look at all the data and then decide whether to approve the vaccine or not. This process can take anywhere between a month or a year.\nWHO is the world health organization.

How? Why?\nPhospofructokinase is an enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, the first part of the respiration reaction. It is an important step in this pathway because it is the main site of regulation - many different things (ATP, AMP, Citrate, Hydrogen ions) regulate this enzyme by binding to one or both of its two sites (once of which is an active site, the other an allosteric or inhibitory site that causes the active site to close).\nEvery cell has a need to make its own ATP. The ATP made in glycolysis (and later by other parts of the respiratory pathway) is used entirely in the cell it is made in. It does not leave the cell it is created in, it just gets used (becoming ADP) and recycled back to the respiration reaction to be remade as more ATP.\nSo the regulation of energy requirements by PFK is a very local affair.\nIf ATP levels get too high in the cell, ATP acts as an inhibitor by binding to the allosteric site on PFK. This is an example of \u2018product feedback\u2019, where the thing the pathway is making is used as an inhibitor in order to avoid wasting resources making more when there is plenty waiting to be used. When ATP levels drop, respiration rate increases and will continue to happen until it again reaches the threshold level where there is too much of it.\nSimilarly, if hydrogen ion concentration rises, for example due to lactic acid build up due to anaerobic exercise, this creates an acidic environment that can be dangerous. So, these ions also work as an inhibitor, stopping respiration until there is enough oxygen to kick off the aerobic steps.\nHowever, all this communication involving PFK is entirely internal. The enzyme itself has no means to communicate anything to any other PFK molecules in other cells. Especially not ones as far apart as the brain and the liver. Each cell regulates the amount of respiraton it performs based on its individual needs, independtly of others.\nInstead, communication indicating a demand for resources is made by other means independent of PFK. For example, an increase in carbon dioxide concentration in blood is taken to mean that there is insufficient oxygen and a need to clear away the excess carbon dioxide. This triggers an increase in breathing rate and heart rate to try to achieve this. Blood glucose sensors in parts of the body also detect when this falls - trigger glucagon release to increase it from stored glycogen in the liver. These systems are all either endocrine (involving hormones secreted into the blood) or nervous (elecrical signals transmitted along nerves).

Physics has come very close to describing that One Thing in terms of the familiar, but close is not quite the same as describing it exactly.\nWe perceive diversity in the Unity because the act of perception is the reduction of the Whole through the tiny apertures of our bodily senses. A very tiny fraction of that Whole gets into our minds via our senses, and its been enough to enable us to not only make accurate maps enabling us to safely navigate the physical and social terrains, but also to contemplate fundamentals.

As a result, how deep in the water the ship can safely be varies based on where the ship is. Thus, the Plimsoll Line was invented:\nAnd it can make a big difference- on some ships, the \u2018tropical fresh water\u2019 line can be close to a meter higher than the \u2018winter North Atlantic\u2019 line. This has repercussions, because if your bow is a meter higher or lower in the water, that can affect how your bow wave is formed, and the shape of the hull section determines your hull speed. Also, under the same load, this ship\u2019s keel will be 9.3 meters below the water line in tropical fresh water, but around 8.4 meters in winter North Atlantic. This matters for navigation - if there\u2019s a sandbar 9 meters below the surface, you may or may not have a problem. Also, this means you\u2019re almost a meter higher or lower next to the dock, which may matter.", "Adding that information would not be detrimental to the paper so why not just add it?

This correctly handles the constructive and destructive interference in the superposition of multiple values for a given observable.\nThere\u2019s also a technical reason that the operators must be Hermitian to guarantee that all the eigenvalues are real numbers, and the observable of momentum in a position representation needs be multiplied by i to get a Hermitian operator.

So when they stationary, what is Velocity when they unbound essentially becomes polar magnetic field.\nSorry, if this is confusing but the theory hangs together because it does this:\nDavid Wrixon EurIng's post in RQDVIII\nAnd maths does not lie.", "Since \u201cmagnetic charge\u201d doesn\u2019t exist the way we have electric charge does exist, a magnetic moment is the key feature of static magnetism found in nature or what can be produced artificially.\nWe don\u2019t find magnetic charges the way we have electric charges (maybe they exist, just not discovered yet). The electron and the proton, each has an electric charge and a magnetic dipole moment. That makes them tiny magnets. A magnet\u2019s strength is based on the density of magnetic moments inside the magnet. The total magnetic moment of a magnet tells us the rotation torque that the magnet will experience in a uniform external magnetic field (a compass needle is an example but also some electric motors) or the magnet\u2019s pulling or pushing force the magnet will experience in an external gradual magnetic field.\nThe slight difference in magnetic moment of differently-bound protons in the human body and in other compounds is the basis of MRI imaging and also NMR for chemistry."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Mikayla Eckel Cifrese", "view_list": [434, 502, 377, 481, 564]}, "76": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 3, "name_list": ["Lyle McElhaney", "Jamil Shariff", "Travis Casey"], "question_title": "Is the light from a 'pinpoint' star image coming to me as an infinitely wide 'wave', such that the wider the telescope objective, the more of the light wave is captured?", "topic_list": ["Light Waves", "Telescopes", "Waves (physics)", "Optics", "Visible Light", "Astronomy", "Science", "Physics"], "no_of_view": "906", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0], "ans_list": ["Yes, it is. It is awe-inspiring how far one can catch photons coming from afar, enough to form at least a spotty image.\nBy analogy, consider the eruption of a supernova. In the process many zillions (a technical term of the trade) of neutrinos are created which zoom away from the Supernova at light speed. Now neutrinos are noted for the ability to easily pass through solid planets like the Earth without even noticing, though every once in a while one will collide with an atomic nucleus and create a ruckus.\nIn 1987 the light of a supernova (SN 1987A - Wikipedia\n) reached the Earth after 168,000 years of travel at very nearly the speed of light from the Large Magellanic Cloud to us. Three hours before the first photo showed brightening of the star, neutrino observatories Kamiokande II\ndetected 12 neutrinos\n; IMB\n, 8 neutrinos; and Baksan\n, 5 neutrinos, in a burst lasting less than 13 seconds. It is amazing that so many were created to radiate outward, obeying the inverse-square law at that distance that we could detect a wave of them here on Earth.", "Yes.\nStars radiate mostly isotropically (which means equally in all directions). So the in the wave-optics way of looking at things, the wavefronts of the light waves from a star are spherical. This corresponds to light rays that point radially outward in all directions, in the geometric-optics way of looking at things.\nBut stars are far enough away that by the time the spherical wavefronts reach Earth, they are so large, that the portion of them we are exposed to is basically flat. So it is as though we are receiving infinite plane wavefronts instead. In the geometric-optics view, this corresponds to the rays having spread out so much that the only ones reaching us are parallel to each other, and to the light source appearing as a point source with no discernible size on the sky.\nThis has two effects:\nThe intensity of the plane wavefront corresponds to a certain amount of power per unit area. So the larger the area of the telescope aperture, the more power is collected (from a point source) and the brighter the star appears. More telescope collecting area lets you see fainter objects.\nThe amount of diffraction at the aperture depends on the aperture size. Diffraction can be explained in terms of Fourier theory: roughly speaking, the intensity pattern at the focal plane of the telescope is the 2D Fourier transform of the intensity pattern at the aperture. In other words, the Fourier transform describes mathematically what the effect of the focusing element (lens or mirror) is. The Fourier transform of an infinite plane of uniform intensity would be a single point in the focal plane. So with a telescope of infinite size, all the light would be perfectly focused down to point (no diffraction) and you\u2019d have infinite spatial resolution. But what happens in reality is that the infinite plane intensity pattern is truncated (cut off) by a circular boundary. So the intensity pattern in the focal plane is the Fourier transform of a finite uniform circle, which is a disc surrounded by progressively dimmer rings. This \u201cAiry disc\u201d is the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture. Because of the nature of the Fourier transform, the smaller the telescope aperture (i.e. the less of the plane wave you capture), the bigger the Airy disc that your point sources get smeared out into, and the poorer your spatial resolution. In contrast, the bigger the telescope aperture, the smaller the Airy discs, and the better your resolution. Bigger telescope apertures result in less diffraction (and hence sharper images) assuming your resolution is limited only by diffraction.", "Yes.

Maybe some do, but the real bonus is from the Hydroxides and such which are found in them.

The problem is all in getting the raw material somewhere to process it, and the processes themselves.

I never made it through to the Ph.D. It always seemed as if anything I wanted to know required I know some other subject first, and that subject required I know another subject, and that subject required yet another, and I would have to back up four or five levels to get to math and physics that I knew and understood. So the material basically kept saying to me, \u201cslog through all this stuff for years, and then maybe you can ask an interesting question afterward.\u201d\nWhat I should have realized, or been told, is that if every step of the journey wasn\u2019t enjoyable, I was on the wrong path. You\u2019re not supposed to slog; you\u2019re supposed to be interested, curious, and happy to explore and learn.\nStill, the problem remains. I have never learned Quantum Field Theory because the sheer number of subjects I need mastery of before I can tackle it looks impossible. By the time I master complex calculus, I have forgotten my linear algebra. By the time I relearn linear algebra, I\u2019ve forgotten my differential equations. And now the next sentence refers to general relativity, and oh look, I haven\u2019t touched that for five years so of course I\u2019ve forgotten how to do it. Again. By the time I catch up on all that, I\u2019ve forgotten my complex calculus again.\nGetting more organized can only do so much. I write more and more detailed notes with every iteration, but still I forget and have to relearn. It goes faster with the notes, but it doesn\u2019t seem possible to hold all of it in my head at once.\nMath is a language, and I never got to speak it, only listen, and not even listen to things I particularly wanted to listen to. So of course I forget it, over and over.\nI have learned far more math and physics as a tutor than I ever learned in graduate school. As a tutor I use my knowledge. And still I have to review and relearn and restudy. I gave up on tutoring organic chemistry because I basically needed to spend an hour per week studying it for the rest of my life if I wanted to stay competent enough to teach it, and it simply isn\u2019t a high enough priority for me.\nWhen I ask this question or see it asked, I always encounter the flippant response, \u201cjust specialize more.\u201d I don\u2019t think that answer cuts it. It will work for a while, but human knowledge keeps growing exponentially, and the frontier of even a specialized area is going to require more and more and more preparation time. Eventually, I don\u2019t see any way to avoid the simple fact that human knowledge will be so vast that it will mostly stop growing because no human being can learn enough to reach the frontier in their lifetime.\nThe most likely future is that AI will take over and keep growing knowledge exponentially, and to us it will effectively be magic because it will literally be beyond human comprehension. And I think that future will arrive a whole lot faster than most people believe. If I take good care of myself I might even live to see it.\nWill we be able to encapsulate knowledge, build abstraction barriers, and perform superhuman acts of summarizing to bring the frontier closer? To some extent. But one day, in the distant future perhaps, it won\u2019t be possible for a mere human to discover anything new.\nBut on a practical note, we aren\u2019t there yet. So there is still plenty of reason to pursue the frontier of human knowledge. It is still reachable. For now, and probably for decades at least to come.

Most napalm is either gasoline- or diesel-based. Orange juice (or any other sticky syrup for that matter) would probably work. Not as well as the professional stuff, but it would almost certainly both stick and burn.\nHis instructions on making explosives are, in fact, pretty much on point. Glycerin is a byproduct of traditional soapmaking, as it forms when fat is hydrolysed by lye. And it is the feedstock for nitroglycerin, which is the active ingredient in dynamite. Given that nitroglycerin was first produced in 1847, it should hardly be surprising that\u2019s it\u2019s production is fairly simple, by modern standards.

The wave function of an atomic energy level is an example. More generally, it\u2019s a solution to the \u201ctime independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\u201d Getting more technical, it\u2019s an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian. They are called \u201cstationary states\u201d because they are standing waves, not traveling waves.\nIn quantum mechanics, everything that\u2019s measurable has a corresponding operator, where an operator is a mathematical transformation from one wave function to another. The Hamiltonian is the operator for energy, which goes back to the statement that a state of definite energy is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian\u2014that is, the Hamiltonian transforms such wave functions to themselves (I.e., it leaves them unchanged).\nOperators that \u201cshare stationary states\u201d refers to operators for measurables that have definite values simultaneously with energy. Angular momentum is an example, and so is spin (a subset of angular momentum). Position and momentum are not. Indeed, famously position and momentum don\u2019t have definite values simultaneously with each other\u2014the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\nOperators with the same eigenfunctions commute\u2014that is, you can apply them in either order. Operators with different eigenfunctions do not commute\u2014that is, the result differs depending on the order in which they are applied.\nTo say that \u201cthat mathematical equations from classical physics always apply to the operators,\u201d means that you can start with an equation where the variables (measurables) are scalers, vectors, and sometimes higher order tensors, and in QM, drop in the corresponding operators instead. The truth of this is suspect for two reasons:\nIn classical physics multiplication involving a scaler always commuted, so it didn\u2019t matter how the equation was written. In general, QM operators don\u2019t commute.\nIn classical physics, the components of a vector always commute. In QM, they don\u2019t. (For example, only one component direction of angular momentum can have a definite value at the same time.)\nAdding further suspicion to the veracity of the statement, it\u2019s singling out \u201cstationary states\u201d\u2014eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian\u2014for special treatment. Were such a rubric to be true, it should be true for any shared set of eigenfunctions.\nFinally, \u201capply to the values\u201d is meaningless. There are no definite values for operators that are not acting on their own eigenfunctions.", "Might as well ask one to describe colors without using any color names.", "Square matrices posses eigen vectors. They represent the stable states and classical physics can understands those states. Any other states can not be solved by classical methods.", "1\nThat is a very narrow view of classical physics (excluding all of magnetism from Maxwell and all Lorentz).\n2 \u201cstationary states\u201d\nIn that quote, the classical physics are thought of a clean equations between particles at a point in time. That is \u2018stationary states\u2019. For example, electrostatic force calculates from the distance (at a point of time). That does not take into consideration particle moment.\nThis approach means that one needs to calculate physics at every point of time, and every change of state. Further, that means that for the measurement to be valid, then each particle cannot change distance.\nNow, yes that is the case; one can calculate each point of a parabola separately, OR do the integral to save time and computation.\nThe statement is true, but does not begin to cover related tools. Maxwell on magnetism of moving electrons is a great example.\na\nThe statement is true (but incomplete. That one calculates electrostatic force at kQQ/d^2. That is limited as the d=distance between the particle (one state) is at one point of time. Coulomb alone does not really handle any time function.\nThe quote seems to consider that a weakness. I think that is the start, a good one.\nb\nI would say that position is a silly complaint about Newtonian physics. It has tools to handle that starting basis. One can use non-QB statistics from classical physics to generate PV=nRT. That is the task for which integrals are made (thanks Newton). We can get from constant increase in velocity to that parabola which is time dependent.\nc\nThere are shortcuts in classical physics. The challenge is checking the requirements to use each.\nA electrostatic field at 1/d^3 will generate a force in on direction at (-1/2)d^2. These are related by math. One can get a lot from this point-in-time.\n3 \u201cto the operators\u201d\nFurther, classical likes to have known particles to create force calculations. Yes, that is a limitation, but that is a limitation that requires us to match to reality.\nThat led to understanding a photon, and engineering its forces. A photon does not meet the original definition of a particle, but we have learned that it captures a force and certain acts like a particle in the refined need.\n4\nThis was \u2018kill the competition\u2019 writing.\nQM itself is a short cut. Instead of calculating all these 3D pendulums (at different distances-states and times (again, if not related other than by conservation of momentum), you can fine e^f functions as the shortcut. Great math. However, that procedure has its requirements a) Hilbert, and b) no inner relationships not in the equation, so no local variables.\na\nDon\u2019t diminish classical to make it equal to QM.\nIn rhetoric argument, this path of the quote is not a good persuasive method. If you need to devalue the alternative to make your proposition win, the does not make your QM a winner. It just devalues the alternative.\nIn this case, we are looking for the correct solution, not equally bad alternatives.\nb\nThe 3D-1T limit of classical physics is not the end. It is a great starting place.\nc\nI think the quote sets up a further paragraph is going on to say that \u201cquantum mechanics equations allow for operators free from this limit\u201d - allowing this combination of states - position and momentum - which is the QM approach. Everything becomes a Hamiltonian or Lagrangian.\nThe math of QM is easy as it gets from both positions and momentum (only if they are connected by conservation momentum). That is the trick. Good - apply it where that criteria works. It saves time for certain problems.", "Perhaps this is not \u201cnon-technical terms\u201d, but what is going on here is that the operators need to commute with each other, in order to satisfy this condition.\nThis can be understood in terms of 2 by 2 matrices. 2 by 2 matrices [math]A[/math] and [math]B[/math] commute if\n[math]AB~=~BA.[/math]\nThat is as nontechnical as I can make it.

We look for shared characteristics. Groups of shared characteristics are then used to break larger groups into smaller groups.\nThe first division is if the organism has a membrane-bound nucleus or not. Those organisms without a membrane-bound nucleus are called prokaryotes. We commonly call these bacteria, but there are actually many different kinds of prokaryotes divided into 2 domains, Bacteria and Archaea. The third domain Eukarya contains all organisms with nuclei in their cells from including plants, animals and many microorganisms.\nProkaryotes tend to be very small.

If it is green, it is probably a plant, although a few green microorganisms are not plants. Does it have structures with which to move? If so, what are they? Many microorganisms have a single, whiplike flagellum or a pair of flagella. Others have many short hairs, called cilia.

Why would this be different to believing in any other god by a different name?\nBut start scratching beneath the surface.

And biologists are the people whose job is to actually study life, so I do think they understand a bit more about it.\nSecond, mutations not only \u2018replace\u2019 other genes (thereby replacing your supposed \u2018lost\u2019 information), but mutations sometimes actually INCREASE \u2018information.\u2019 How? By duplicating genes and chromosomes, which actually increases the total amount of genetic information.\nPlease go home and read some science textbooks and quit listening to your creationist leaders, who lie to you because that is their job.", "What does \u2018information\u2019 have to do with survival and reproduction? And exactly how is information \u2018lost' when each instance of reproduction leads to the birth of 1-n new individuals, each with a full complement of the genes inherited from both parents? If a cat has ten kittens, and only six of them survive, that's still three times the genetic information carried by the breeding pair.", "Is Natural Selection the Same Thing as Evolution?\nThis is indeed surprising.", "Okay, here\u2019s the thing. \u201cInformation\u201d is ridiculously hard to quantify. This is one of those problems that seems easy and intuitive but will reach up and strangle you in your sleep. Consider something like Shannon information. A string of linear text filled with random letters has maximum \u2018Shannon Information.\u2019 It probably has more Shannon Information than a properly written sentence of the same length. Why do we use such a weird and horrid metric to measure information where random gibberish can indicate a message has a high capacity for information? Because a better metric is not available. That\u2019s how bad a situation we\u2019re in, trying to quantify information.\nBut let me give a more practical and real world example about information. Lets say that you have a gene for the pigment in your optical cones that sees red light. We think that gene has \u201cinformation,\u201d right. Now lets say that you copy that gene. How much information is there now? Double? Or not? It\u2019s kindof hard to quantify.\nNow lets say you alter the active site of the second gene so that it absorbs a different wavelength of light than the original. Perhaps that\u2019s viewed as a degradation, but If you have both copies of this gene you\u2019ll be able to differentiate one shade of red from another. There are some women like this, called tetrachromats.\nI admit that this answer is very narrow and really over-simplified. It\u2019s only one example and many of the mechanisms at work might not even be known. But it should at least partially answer your question.", "It is Not a fact that information (whatever that is) is Ultimately (when do you mean?) lost.\nYour understanding of evolution seems to be based on creationist distorted information. Their \u201cinformation\u201d should be lost.", "How do creationists account for the fact that this is a monumentally ignorant question, proven as such for the better part of a half century.", "reject premise", "Looking at the overall picture the less useful stuff for the individual organism is dropped. Positive mutations, meaning more competitive, are brought in.", "Natural selection favors extra information because information is versatility and usefulness.\nIf you mean random mutation, think about this. If a mutation can remove information, the reverse of the mutation can add information. Many random mutations can add information.\nMost do nothing meaningful. But some add a tiny bit of usefulness. An example might be a dog getting spotty which makes it harder to see when moving or a peacock getting bluer and more sexy to the lady peacocks.\nEven creationists accept these tiny changes. They pretty much have to because dogs and farm animals have changed tremendously because of human breeding. There any many changes in the wild, the most famous of which being Kettlewell\u2019s peppered moths which changed color to hide on trees made dark and sooty by extreme pollution.\nBTW creationists have criticized Kettlewell on the basis that some of his photos were of dead moths pinned to trees. They didn\u2019t have the photographic technology to capture a moving moth. But the numerical data is completely sound and has been studied by thousands of students.\nIn any case is it not hard to imagine a tiger and a jaguar evolving from a proto cat or a proto cat evolving from a generic four footed mammal. At each stage the descendants get more complicated and more specialized and better at surviving in their niche. More information, not less. Dogs and cats are both a subtype of the early mammal. Saying it\u2019s a dog is more informative than saying it\u2019s a descendant of a generic four legged mammal.\nFor TMI I recommend the site Talk.origins.", "It is not true that information is lost and never gained in the process of natural selection.\nPeople who make that statement generally treat \u201cinformation\u201d, \u201cmessage\u201d, and \u201cknowledge\u201d as synonyms, which when used in a scientific/engineering context are quite distinct concepts.\nInformation is gained any time there are more coding elements than prior. Information is the number of possible messages that can be made from the set of coding elements. If a reproduction event doesn\u2019t reduce the count of codons then no information is lost. If a reproduction event increases the count of codons then information has been increased. That is a mathematical truth, not something subject to opinion, it derives from the definition of information.\nOn the other hand a message might easily be corrupted, and thereby some knowledge lost, but the mere survival of a message constitutes knowledge gained, and it is knowledge that natural selection creates, knowledge of those messages which tell you a good combination of features for successful reproduction.\nNote: each time an organism reproduces perfectly the amount of genetic information related to that species still increases. Death will decrease it.\n\u2014\nRead Claude Shannon\u2019s mathematical theory of communication. It is dense and can take a while to fully comprehend. If you can\u2019t comprehend it then you can\u2019t contribute beneficially to discussions of information and evolution, your vocabulary will not align with those who understand how information works.", "It\u2019s not a fact. This nonfact (it has a 3 letter name) ignores natural selection.", "\u201cInformation\u201d is neither gained nor lost through selection. This happens when the DNA is formed not when selected.", "It accounts for it easily because your premise is not true.\nThere is a clear and known means for mutations and natural selection to add information.

It probably took me about half that time to figure out how to do it half-way properly.\nYou\u2019ve said you\u2019re passionate about science \u2014 and that\u2019s great! The next step is to make sure you\u2019re passionate about the right thing. I beg your indulgence if I\u2019m telling you what you already know, but I want to get us both on the same page.\nScience is not simply knowing things.\nScience is the process of discovering things.\nLet\u2019s look at the question you\u2019d like to answer: \u201cWhy is the sky blue?\u201d You\u2019ll often find find the explanation of the sky\u2019s blue color is given as \u201cRayleigh scattering\n\u201d.

Do you really know why the sky is blue? If you can\u2019t explain it simply, there\u2019s a good chance you don\u2019t know the answer as well as you thought you did. That\u2019s not a problem \u2014 it just means it\u2019s time to find out. Don\u2019t skip any steps, and don\u2019t retreat into jargon. [1]\nHere\u2019s the most important thing you must be able to do. You have to be able to say to your child, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You should follow that with, \u201cI\u2019ll try to find out.\u201d Your child might ask, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you know?\u201d The answer to that is simple: \u201cNobody knows everything. There\u2019s always something new to learn, and that\u2019s a wonderful thing.\u201d Don\u2019t try to dodge, because your kids will pick that up \u2014 if not every time, at least most of the time.\nDo everything you can to get your kids to not just ask for a quick answer. Get them into the habit of learning how to find out. Then, you\u2019ll have taught them the basics of genuine science. It will serve them well for a lifetime.\n[1] I\u2019m put this long-ish diversion into a footnote. Many years ago, I was asked to write a school program on electricity for Grade 6 students visiting our museum. I said to myself, \u201cI\u2019m an electrical engineer. This will be easy!\u201d\nNope.\nI soon discovered I didn\u2019t really know what \u201celectricity\u201d was. Oh, I could design circuits and write equations, but I couldn\u2019t answer that damnable question, \u201cWhy?\u201d in terms someone who wasn\u2019t an electrical engineer could follow. I decided to go back to the absolute basics: atoms and electrically charged things. After a lot of work, much of which required learning humility, I came up with a model of electricity that didn\u2019t require anything more than basic arithmetic and a few simple concepts.\nI set my Grade 6 students (and their parents and teachers) a very simple starting point: positively charged things, negatively charged things, and a quest to make a system that\u2019s electrically neutral: every \u201cplus\u201d matches a \u201cminus\u201d. After 90 minutes, they\u2019ve got the rudiments of \u201celectricity\u201d. Oh, they\u2019ve still got plenty to learn, but they\u2019ve got a very solid base of concepts.\nAfter one program, a parent who\u2019d come as a volunteer with her child\u2019s class came up to me. She said, \u201cI\u2019m an electrical engineer, and I\u2019d never looked at electricity like that before. I don\u2019t think I ever understood it so well!\u201d As I told her, \u201cNeither did I! The kids just followed my little journey of discovery.\u201d", "Yes, or at least, a somewhat simplified version, with maybe a demonstration of light refraction. Simplify the technical terms but explain how it works. Children want to know!", "Dad. Why is the sky blue?\nThat was one of many questions my Dad, God rest his soul, could not give me. He was not a scientist but he was a good and intelligent man. I learned that Chemistry (and Physics) could answer all those questions. So I went into the sciences whole heartedly.\nWhy can plastic bend but glass breaks?\nWhy can I see through glass but not steel?\nWhy does wood burn but not rocks?\nWhy do clouds form? What is freezing rain, lightning, electricity, \u2026?\nThe list of such questions goes on and on.\nMy kids went to school knowing all those answers. My parent teacher interviews always included comments about teachers repeatedly thinking my kids were much older than their peers because they spoke so much more intelligently.\nI still love science and especially I love teaching. I always have loved that.", "It\u2019s not so much a \u201cscientific\u201d explanation, just the correct explanation.\nAbsolutely yes, along with the correct explanations to every other question asked. Children are at an age where learning is easy, and information sticks. Teaching them false information is a tragic wasted opportunity and will burden them with the hassle of having to relearn all of the phoney nonsense that they have been taught when they get older - even worse some of the bullshit may persist if they do not realise it is wrong.", "Yes! Absolutely! But you do it with a vocabulary they will mostly understand while introducing only one or two new words and explain what those words mean.", "I\u2019d get her a prism. Nothing special, something from a thrift shop. Maybe crystal in the house. Then I would show her how the prism makes colours from sunlight on the wall. See the blue? That\u2019s what the sky is doing. Then give her the prism. Have fun.\nIn a nutshell.", "When my kids were small I just told them blue is the color of air only the color is very very faint and it takes miles and miles of the air for the color to show up.\nAnd that\u2019s true. Of course, we can discuss WHY its blue like that, including the light scattering effects due to the random creation and dissolution of tiny variations in density at the atomic level . . . but there\u2019s no need to discuss that with a five year old.", "Light is made up of every color; it just so happens that there are these tiny things we call molecules in the atmosphere that this light hits. The neat thing is blue scatters more than all the other colors. So instead of seeing red or orange or a yellow sky, we see blue. This is because the different colors of light have different energies. And those energies can be thought of as waves (like on a lake). Blue light has smaller waves, travels shorter distances, and scatters around in the sky whereas the other colors have too long a wave length for us to see.\nYes. Tell your kid exactly what\u2019s happening. I was talking about the theory of evolution and quantum mechanics with my kids when they were two and three years old. I broke the concepts up into smaller bits. But they possess the hardware ultimately to piece things together. They are far more intelligent than we give them credit for. When curiosity fuels your thought processes you tend to worry less about being right and really just end up pursuing truth wherever it takes you. Adults forget this (and this is why so many of them are so stupid).", "Yes, a simplified version of the truth.\nIf children know stuff, they have the ammunition to answer their own questions and that is where intelligence comes from during the first five years..\nEVERY question got an answer.", "Yes.

I will sumarize that for you:\nif Psychoanalysis is or is not a science is not a problem for Psychoanalysis - we know for sure Psychoanalysis is not only a science, but garanteed the scientificization of Psychology and Psychopathology in one side, and the other side, retroactivelly, created the concept of scientific revolution or cut as Freud stabilished the series that includes Copernico (or Newton if you prefer) and Darwin and himself - the their component of the series is which garantees there is a series, this is a basic geometric, mathematic, concept since Euclydes;\nThis means that Psychoanalysis, being a metapsychology, is itself an epistemology - the matters at play in the unconscious is precisely a dialetics of knowledge and non-knowledge. This any non-idiot epistemologist from other schools (Piaget, Foucault, Georges Canguilhem, Wittgenstein - but not Popper) would acknowledge. The same can not be said of other sciences: Biology and Physics and Chemistry are not epistemologies in themselves and so can not justifie themselves as sciences\u2026;\nSo why is the scientificity of Psychoanalysis a matter to other sciences? Because in our epistemology we know that any knowledge is unconscious - without this conception, scientific discoveries as insights can not be explained: be it the impulse by Archimedes or the dynamic formule of benzine by Kekul\u00e9; and if the other sciences reject that concept (like Popper did), they become lame;\nThis put, it means that Psychoanalysis, being a science, is not wholy a science - its positivie effects are not scientificizeable, as its objects are failed ones, negative objects that are byproducts of other sciences: failed acts, word sleeps, symptoms, the unconscious itself, etc;\nBut this means also that this non-wholy scientificity garantees a surplus that goes beyond scientificity in the same sense Marx says surplus-value, and as such psychoanalysis is a more-than-science."], "date_list": ["Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Anonymous", "view_list": [95]}, "23": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["Vishnuthirtha Madaksira", "Divyansh Verma"], "question_title": "What is the maximum number of hydrogen bonds that can form between HN2 - NH2, (hydrazine) and water?", "topic_list": ["Hydrazine", "Hydrogen Bonds", "Chemical Bonds", "Hydrogen", "Physical Chemistry", "Chemistry of Everyday Life", "Organic Chemistry", "Water", "Science", "Chemistry"], "no_of_view": "113", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "ans_list": ["Four (4).", "Each water molecule is linked by six hydrogen bonds to hydrazine molecules.The hydrazine molecules are not bonded to each other."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Debayan Raha", "view_list": [20, 9]}, "233": {"no_of_follower": 3, "respond_collected": 4, "name_list": ["Vansh Wahi", "Adam Jacholkowski", "Richard Smythe", "Harsh Jain"], "question_title": "What is the relationship between photons and antimatter?", "topic_list": ["Antimatter", "Matter (physics)", "Photons", "Theoretical Physics", "Quantum Mechanics", "Particle Physics", "Physics of Everyday Life", "Astrophysics", "Science", "Physics"], "no_of_view": "1,125", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [1, 2, 2, 0], "ans_list": ["Each particle of ordinary matter, such as the electron and the proton, has an antimatter counterpart, with the same mass but opposite charge, as shown in the table.

The photon is incident on to the electron of a particle in the sky. There are three stages:-\nThe photon travels toward the electron\nThe electron absorbs the photon and the electron continues with a higher amount of momentum\nThe electron then re-radiates the photon out again, dropping to it\u2019s original state. Here\u2019s the Feynman Diagram (of sorts)\n(You view the unfolding of the scattering process as a horizontal line across the diagram moving upward with increasing time.)\nFeynman then picked up a chair and rotated it. He said, \u201cWe all agree it was a chair before I moved it, and after rotation in space; it\u2019s still a chair, right?\u201d (We all nodded our heads)\n\u201cEinstein showed us that we can think of space-time as a kind of space with time as an extra dimension - so now let me rotate this picture for scattering, like I did the chair, by 90 degrees about the time axis.\u201d (Here\u2019s the result).\nThere it is! The photon scattering by an electron - why the sky is blue - is essentially the same Physics as electron-positron annihilation or particle-anti-particle creation. You just have to think of the positron as an electron moving backward in time. (That\u2019s what anti-matter is! \u2014- repulsion between two electrons played backward in time looks like attraction; so the anti-particle is to have \u2018opposite\u2019 charge!\u2026lol - Smart man; RPF!) Of course, mass-energy must be conserved, so there\u2019s a difference in momenta and energies through this scenario. (The time axis is scaled by a factor of \u2018C\u2019 using ordinary length and time units.)\nThis is exactly how Feynman treated the positron in his calculations and he got the right answers. Note: Because the photon travels at speed C; it\u2019s proper time is zero so it doesn\u2019t travel with any proper-time passing. Therefore a photon cannot distinguish it\u2019s \u2018direction\u2019 through time; it is, therefore, it\u2019s OWN anti-particle; whether moving forward or backward.", "They both don't have mass."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Ahmad Mbark", "view_list": [24, 47, 302, 13]}, "398": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "How do you measure the energy of BEC in terms of temperature (condensed matter, temperature, Bose-Einstein condensate, and physics)?", "topic_list": ["Bose-Einstein Condensates", "Condensed Matter Physics", "Theoretical Physics", "Quantum Mechanics", "Temperature", "Thermodynamics", "Energy (physics)", "Science", "Physics"], "no_of_view": "195", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Dex Jackson", "view_list": []}, "498": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "How does philosophy work?

How does it disprove an infinite universe?\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t. An infinite universe has problems of its own, however. Read this bit from an essay my dad wrote many years ago, to get an idea of how serious these problems can get:\nQUOTE\nSerious Problems with an Infinite Universe\nAlthough a finite universe may have its problems, an infinite universe has its problems too: perhaps more so. But they are not the problems described in most text books: as we shall prove below, most of the common arguments against an infinite universe found in modern books on cosmology don\u2019t hold water.\nFor example\u2014and this question has been asked numerous times in the literature\u2014why is the sky dark at night? It sounds like a stupid question, but a little thought is needed to pose it (with emphasis on the word \u201clittle\u201d). The argument goes as follows: if the stars extend for an infinite distance, there should be an infinite number of stars in the universe. So every line of sight would have to end up, somewhere, on the surface of a star. In that case, the entire night sky should be as bright as the surface of the average star, namely much like the surface of the sun. It obviously isn\u2019t. So, if an infinite universe is filled with stars (which, however, definitely wouldn\u2019t be the case, as we shall see further on) it seems very hard to \u201crigorously\u201d postulate a universe of infinite size.\nPeople have enunciated other problems regarding an infinite universe as well: for instance\u2014as Newton himself mentions in his book\u2014it seems impossible to have gravity as we know it. Every object would be surrounded by an infinite number of other objects, all of them pulling with infinite force in every direction. This is because even though they might all be very far away, there would be an infinite number of them. This would end up with the pull of every object being cancelled out by the gravitational attraction of the objects on the opposite side. The net effect would be zero gravity everywhere. Thus Hawking says \u201cIt is impossible to have an infinite static model of the universe in which gravity is always attractive\u201d (A Brief History of Time, page 5).\nHowever, neither of these arguments really stands up to the closest kind of scrutiny, because they both assume that an infinite universe is pretty much the same everywhere, namely much like it is around here (within a thirteen- to fifteen-billion light-years\u2019 distance, of course\u2014but that\u2019s a piddling distance compared with infinity). However, as we shall prove below, this is definitely not going to be the case: mathematics and logic demand that an infinite universe, if it really is infinite, has got to be filled with the most incredible marvels, the likes of which we have never seen, and indeed could hardly even begin to imagine.\nPostulating an infinite universe does have problems, but they are much worse than the ones argued above. Taking the notion of infinity seriously is, in point of fact, enough to drive a finite human mind stark raving mad. It\u2019s true that we often use the term glibly; and some eminent scientists, like Alex Lerner and even Nobel Laureate Hannes Alfv\u00e9n, have gone so far as to postulate that the universe is actually infinite\u2014obviously without trying to grasp how big infinity really is. But when meditated upon seriously, the notion of infinity is worthy of at least a Kafka novel.\nExercise to Try and Grasp the Immensity of Infinity\nDo the following as an exercise: write down the biggest finite number you can think of\u2014like, say, a Googolplex (as you probably know, 10^100\u2014which is about the number of electrons in the visible universe, give or take a few orders of magnitude\u2014is defined in mathematics as a Googol, and 10 raised to the power of a Googol is defined as a Googolplex). Now raise a Googolplex to the power of a Googolplex raised to the power of a Googolplex raised to the power of a Googolplex ... and do this a Googolplex times over, and then triple it for good measure, and add eleventeen. Then sit down and smugly think about how absolutely h u m o n g o u s this number is in comparison with anything you have ever known.\nBut now compare this number with infinity. As you can plainly see, it is as nothing, or pretty darn close to nothing, when compared to infinity. (The reason I say \u201cpretty darn close\u201d is that a real nothing is infinitely smaller than any finite number, however small; but we shall leave off discussing the peculiarities of nothing-at-all till later).\nNow this exercise may sound like an over-sensationalisation using mathematics for an excuse, but as we shall see below, it has quite definite logical and mathematical implications. For instance, it is mathematically certain that in an infinite universe, everything that is even remotely possible, even though highly improbable, must exist.\nThe Peculiarities of Probability in an Infinite Universe\nThis is because of the way probability is treated mathematically. A tossed coin, for instance, has a chance of 1 in 2 of landing heads up. But if you toss two coins, or toss one coin twice, it has 3 chances in 4 of landing heads up at least once. This is obviously better than 1 chance in 2. If you toss it three times, the chances of it landing heads up at least once become 7 in 8, which is better than 3 in 4. The more times you toss the coin, or the more coins you toss, the chances of at least one landing heads up keep on improving. So if you toss a million coins, or toss a single coin a million times, it is virtually certain that at least one will land heads up. And if you toss an infinite number of coins or toss a single coin an infinite number of times, it is absolutely certain that at least one of them will land heads up.\nThe same goes for any kind of event, whatever its probability of occurring. Take the throw of dice. If you throw a die once, there is only 1 chance in 6 that it will land with the six dots up. But if you toss an infinite number of dice, or toss a single die an infinite number of times, it becomes absolutely certain that at least one will land with the six dots up.\nSo think of any event at all, and take a wild guess as to what chance it has of occurring. One in a million? One in a billion? One in a trillion? One in a gazillion? No matter how big that number is, as long as it is a finite number, it\u2019s still virtually as nothing compared to infinity. Every finite number goes into infinity innumerable times\u2014an infinite number of times. So unless an event has absolutely no chance at all of occurring, given an infinite number of chances, it must occur, with absolute mathematical certainty.\nNow in an infinite universe there can be no limit to the number of objects: for (among other arguments) to postulate an infinite stretch of space without objects to fill it would appear to be meaningless. (Nevertheless we shall be discussing this peculiarity too, later on). It also follows from what we have said above, that in an infinite universe there can be no limit to the total number of each kind of object. There can be no limit to the number of coins, to the number of dice, and so on. This is because every object is simply a collection of a finite number of elementary particles\u2014baryons, leptons, mesons, quarks, photons, gravitons, super-strings, \u201cwavicles\u201d, or whatever the latest particle-physics theory allows. And thus there is always going to be a finite probability that a finite number of elementary particles, whatever they may be, have come together precisely in such a way as to form a particular object of finite size: a coin, a die, a Porsche 911 or anything else.\nAnd since there is a finite probability that there is, for example, at least one coin in an infinite universe, there is also a finite probability\u2014somewhat smaller, naturally\u2014that there are two; and also a finite probability\u2014even smaller of course, but still not zero\u2014that there are three, four, five ... or for that matter any number you can think of, plus one. So no matter how many coins you wish to postulate there can be in an infinite universe, there must be at least one more. Thus there can be no limit to the number of coins in an infinite universe. And the same applies to dice, eggs, teacups, Porsche cars, professors of physics, or anything else.\nNow this conclusion allows for a staggering variety of objects in the universe: for different objects can come together in different ways to make other, larger objects\u2014the way nuts and bolts and wheels and tires and engine and chassis and transmission and dashboard and wipers and windshield and other such objects can come together to make a Porsche. And this, obviously, can happen in ways hitherto unimagined, because any number of smaller objects, whatever they may be, can come together in such as way as to make up an object bigger than any of them. As a result this proves, mathematically speaking, that there can also be no limit to the variety of objects in an infinite universe, and no limit to their size either.\nCopies of our own \u201cUniverse\u201d\nThus it is not merely likely, but a definite mathematical certainty, that if the universe is really infinite, somewhere in that immense vastness a great many elementary particles have come together, purely by accident, in such a way as to duplicate the place we call \u201cour known universe\u201d in every single detail, including you, me, our families (if we have any), our pets (if we have any), our Porsches (if we have any), the mechanics in the garages and the professors in the universities, the rattlers in the prairies and the orang-utans in the jungles, the stars in the galaxies and the quasars far far away from the home planet, not to mention New York. This is extraordinarily improbable, but no presently known law of nature precludes such a thing from happening\u2014and the proof is, that it actually has happened here!\u2014so in an infinite universe, it must have happened somewhere else too. This is a mind-boggling conclusion, but it is totally logical and mathematically impeccable. If the universe truly is infinite, all those people and animals and things must definitely be out there somewhere, going about their business, blissfully unaware that we exist, an exact copy of everything they know. Most of them, indeed, wouldn\u2019t even believe in us, just as most of us wouldn\u2019t believe in them.\nAnd if you think that\u2019s bad enough, let me tell you, it can get a lot worse: logically speaking, in that immense vastness there must be an even further copy of the place we call \u201chome\u201d, along with every single one of its professors and Porsches and stars and galaxies and quasars and New York and all, exactly like ours except for one small detail, namely that Hitler won the Second World War!\nSherlock Holmes\u2019s Principle\nThus everything that is merely \u201chighly improbable\u201d (and which we often wrongly speak of as being \u201cimpossible\u201d) must exist in an infinite universe. For instance, improbable as it sounds, somewhere in the vastness of infinity there must, quite literally, be a very puzzled person sitting at a table tossing a coin for an entire lifetime, and seeing it land heads up every single toss. There must also be, somewhere in an infinite universe, that proverbial horde of monkeys sitting at typewriters and typing away at random, producing the entire works of Shakespeare totally by chance. This too is highly improbable but not totally impossible, so in an infinite universe it can no longer be proverbial, but must be a dead cert!\nWhy, it is also certain that somewhere in that vast infinity there is a place very much like our own, in which there is a real Beverly Hills Cop named Axel Foley, who bears a striking resemblance to our own Eddie Murphy, and who is at this very moment attempting, with the help of other cops improbably called Tagart, Rosewood and Bogomil, to track down a murderer and drug dealer called Victor Maitland in another Beverly Hills in another California on another Earth in another Milky Way, far, far away from us. Come to that, every movie ever made and every play and novel ever written, whether based on fact or fiction, whether produced in our \u201cknown universe\u201d or in another\u2014provided it is not totally impossible to duplicate in reality\u2014must be duplicated in reality somewhere in a total universe that is really infinite. As Sherlock Holmes said, \u201cOnce you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\u201d\nIndeed, in an infinite universe, even Sherlock Holmes, along with Hamlet, Macbeth and Don Quixote, must have a too, too solid and fleshy existence. (\u201dTo be or not to be, that ain\u2019t the question\u2014it\u2019s always gonna have to be To Be!\u201d) And yes, Virginia, in an infinite universe there really is a Santa Claus.\nScience Fiction as Science Fact\nAnd it gets weirder and weirder the more one takes it seriously (which is a weird phenomenon in itself). For instance, due to the two facts that an infinite universe must contain an infinite variety of objects, and that in an infinite universe every thing that can exist must exist, every invention ever made\u2014and also every invention that ever will be made\u2014must exist in an infinite universe. So somewhere out there, if you search hard enough, you should be able to find your standard issue photon torpedoes, laser phasers, holodecks and even entire Federation Starships\u2014and pretty much every other device dreamed up by every sci-fi author since the Prophet Ezekiel, as long as it has the least chance of being a viable invention.\nIndeed, every alien life form that could possibly exist, however remote that possibility may be, must also exist somewhere in an infinite universe. So somewhere in outer space, what to speak of Romulan cloaking devices, even the Romulans themselves, along with E.T., Mr Spock and Darth Vader, must have a very real existence. Why, some of them, like Yoda the Jedi Master, have got to be considerably smarter and wiser than we are (although it surely wouldn\u2019t be too hard to achieve that goal, considering the various messes we\u2019ve gotten ourselves into from time to time).\nAnd an infinite universe also implies an eternal universe, for more than one reason: for example, if eternity is not implied, the objects in the universe could never have had enough time to distribute themselves over all of infinite space. Also, if one claims that the universe is infinite in space but limited in time, what one is really saying is, that one fine morning in the middle of nothing an infinite universe came into being everywhere all of a sudden, and one fine evening it\u2019s going to disappear just as suddenly as it came\u2014which really is a bit too hard to swallow. (But then again, why not?)\nAnyway, if the universe is eternal in time as well as infinite in space, many of these super-smart aliens (of whom we spoke earlier) must have had quite enough time to grow even smarter and more technologically advanced, and thus to develop \u201cwarp drives\u201d or even faster modes of transportation; and to use that technology to travel as far as our own neighbourhood of the universe\u2014maybe all they have to do is \u201cbeam\u201d themselves over here in the twinkling of an eye, or whatever they use for eyes. So they may have even got to know us, or at least have watched our TV programs which we\u2019ve been broadcasting all over space ever since we invented TV, and which have by now spread to a distance of 50 or 60 light years from earth. (Not that Yoda looks too much like he watches soaps, except maybe occasionally). The very fact that we ourselves exist at all, probably indicates that based on their viewing, they don\u2019t consider us to be too much of a threat to them. Now that\u2019s a humbling thought.\nThe Implications of Intelligence and Consciousness\nIndeed if one seriously postulates an eternity of time as well as an infinity of space\u2014and it\u2019s really hard to see, from our present understanding of science, how the one can exist without the other, since Relativity too requires time and space to be inseparably linked\u2014then even more wild and wonderful things become inevitable. This is due to the fact that the universe also contains two very significant\u2014and, in the long run, immeasurably powerful\u2014forces, viz., intelligence and consciousness: namely our own. Agreed, we have very little of the former yet, but we\u2019re getting better; and we do have a lot of the latter. And one of the by-products of intelligence and consciousness seems to be technological skill, or the ability to manipulate one\u2019s environment to one\u2019s own benefit.\nNow as we have shown, if we have these properties, it is inevitable that others have them too, somewhere in that immensity. Indeed due to the immensity of infinity, there can be no end to the number of intelligent, conscious and technologically skilled life forms out there. And therefore, at least a fraction of that number must have developed technology so advanced, that to us it would appear quite magical (as Arthur C. Clarke has convincingly stated, \u201cAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\u201d). Out of an infinite number, however, \u201ca fraction\u201d is also an infinite number: and thus there can be no end to these highly skilled technicians in an infinite universe.\nNow it is one of the characteristics of both intelligence and consciousness, that they increase with time: at least, that\u2019s what evolution on earth seems to indicate, with a zillion and one examples, and more. Indeed they seem to increase at an increasing rate, almost in geometric progression. So if there\u2019s enough time\u2014an eternity of time\u2014then once these properties appeared anywhere, they would tend to increase, and that too increase at an increasing rate, indefinitely. Of course in some such cases the destructive tendencies of the aliens in question would destroy them before they managed to get really smart and figure out that they\u2019re being self-destructive\u2014as we ourselves might be doing.\nBut since there would be no end to the number of such life forms, at least some of them must, inevitably, wise up to that danger, clean up their act, and stop themselves before it\u2019s too late. (As Buckminster Fuller has said, \u201cRight now, humanity is sitting for its final exam\u201d). After passing such a final exam, intelligent life forms would just keep getting more and more intelligent, and that too at a faster and faster rate, till they became infinitely intelligent! (Hey: they\u2019d have had all of eternity to get there).\nAnd even if the term \u201cinfinitely intelligent\u201d has no real meaning, at least to our finite human minds, there would be nothing to prevent such aliens from developing, over an eternity of time, technology capable of getting round many, or even all, the limitations of the universe they live in, along with its infinities, zeroes, speed of light, Planck\u2019s constant, Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle, and whatever else they may find cramping their style. In other words, they are probably able\u2014given an actual eternity of time\u2014to substantially modify their universe to make it more suitable to their own way of life, after the manner in which we ourselves modify our environment (limited at present to objects on a more or less human scale, and mostly confined to the earth, and at best a few thousand miles out in space).\nThus, on the principle that \u201canything we can do, they can do better\u201d, they could, in all likelihood, create new universes which would be more to their liking than the one they were born into: just as we nowadays create cities which we like better than the jungle, are thinking in the future of \u201cterraforming\u201d other planets like Mars, and even, in a more distant future, of manufacturing \u201cDyson spheres\u201d all around an entire star, so as to capture all of its energy output for human use.\nAnd on the principle that \u201canything they could do, they would do\u201d (don\u2019t we ourselves follow that principle?\u2014and doesn\u2019t every other creature we know?) if they could modify the present universe or create another one, they most likely would. And that raises the distinct possibility that we are actually living inside an entire universe modified or created by one of these incredibly super-intelligent life forms to suit themselves (just as our tigers and lions are living in a terrestrial environment increasingly being modified to suit homo sapiens.) Such a universe probably suits those aliens just fine, but since it wasn\u2019t tailor-made for us, we of course don\u2019t like it all that much. But they probably don\u2019t care, unless they happen to regard us as a \u201cprotected species\u201d.\nAnd be it noted very carefully, that even though the words \u201cmaybe\u201d, \u201cprobably\u201d and \u201cprobability\u201d occur several times in the argument above, we have already demonstrated that anything that is at all probable becomes an absolute certainty in an infinite universe. So everything we have said above has GOT to be so!\nThe Impossible Implications of Absurdity\nIf all this sounds absurd, that\u2019s because it\u2019s meant to be. It\u2019s also meant to be taken seriously, however. It\u2019s what is called a reductio ad absurdum, that is to say, illustrations of the absurd implications of a theory, hypothesis or postulate. If the logical implications of such a notion are absurd, then so also must the notion be, at least in some respect.\nAnd (eyebrows raised!) it gets even more absurd. All this time we\u2019ve been discussing mere improbabilities, not true impossibilities, such as the \u201cfact\u201d (required by Relativity, and apparently indicated by many \u201cexperiments\u201d) that the speed of light is a constant for all observers, and cannot be exceeded. But the logical implications of an infinite universe extend far beyond mere improbabilities. For one thing, an infinite universe implies, quite literally, that we can never know it all, or even get any kind of signal from all of it, whether we or the signals travel at light speed, or even at warp speed. Mathematically, if we postulate any finite speed at all, no matter how great, as being the speed limit in an infinite universe, we\u2014and even those super-smart aliens\u2014would still have to remain ignorant of most of it. Only at truly infinite speed could we, or any signal, travel the length and breadth of a truly infinite universe: and infinite speed implies all sorts of other weird and wonderful impossibilities, such as being in two places at the same time, or even, for that matter, being everywhere at once.\nActually, due to the limitations of Quantum Mechanics, this problem applies to finite universes too, provided they are large enough (such as those postulated by some \u201cinflationary universe\u201d theorists). Quantum Mechanics implies that there must be a theoretical limit to the size of any observable universe: this size would be the distance it takes for light from the brightest object that could possibly exist to spread out so much, and thus become so faint, that it reaches the observer in a quantity less than one photon (a photon being the quantum of light). It is an immutable tenet of Quantum Theory, that less than one quantum of anything cannot be detected, even with the most perfect of (theoretical) instruments; and if that\u2019s the case, even the brightest possible object couldn\u2019t be observed beyond a certain (finite) distance.\nAnd there must be a limit to how bright an object can get, at least as far as an outside observer is concerned: for instance, if the quantity of light produced by an object is so great that the gravity generated by the mass of that light itself is enough to trap all the light into a black hole, then no matter how much brighter the object becomes, none of its light could ever leave it, and thus the object could never be observed. (Other arguments like this could also be devised, and the reader may find it illuminating to meditate upon the subject independently).\nSo in an infinite universe\u2014or even in a large enough finite universe\u2014our part of it must perforce be surrounded by an immeasurably larger unknowable part (\u201dimmeasurable\u201d because there would, of course, be no way to measure it.)\nAnd in an infinite universe, this would actually be an infinitely larger unknowable part. In fact, not only could we not know all of an infinite universe, we couldn\u2019t even know a significant part of it: we could only know an insignificant part, literally and mathematically speaking, of an infinite universe.\nNow if we can know only an insignificant part of the real universe, it follows logically that nothing we can possibly say about the whole universe has any real significance. And this opens up the possibility, not only of having improbabilities as certainties, but of having true impossibilities as real possibilities. This is because there would be absolutely no guarantee that anything we say about the entire universe is true: how could we possibly know? At the very least, nothing we say about the entire universe could possibly be meaningful (for that\u2019s what \u201csignificant\u201d means). A meaningless statement can\u2019t, of course, be true, at least logically speaking, no matter what Alice or the Red Queen might have said about it.\nThus we would never be able to truthfully say about any event x, that it has absolutely zero probability of occurring, all throughout an infinite universe. As a result, every event could have a finite probability of occurring\u2014even those that are impossible!\nIn fact, we could never even say that mathematics and logic as we know them\u2014what to speak of physics, chemistry, biology or history\u2014must apply all over an infinite universe. That would be tantamount to claiming that we can know anything about something about which we can know nothing: an absurdly self-contradictory claim.\nActually this is not as far-out a claim as may be imagined, for as is well known to cosmologists, to a very limited and non-absurd extent this applies to finite universes too: such as at the centre of a black hole. However, in a finite universe such \u201csingularities\u201d, as cosmologists call these localities where the laws of science don\u2019t apply, are infinitely small, and thus severely restricted.\nThe laws of science do not, of course, apply in a singularity; but it is not entirely clear, even to cosmologists, whether or not most of mathematics could apply there, since a singularity is supposed to be as small as a single geometric point. For this reason it is clear that geometry, at least, couldn\u2019t apply: how could a triangle or a square\u2014or even a line\u2014exist in an infinitely small space? And it seems logical, also, to think that a finite but plural number of geometric points\u2014two or more\u2014could not exist inside an infinitely small space: that is to say, a space big enough to contain only one geometric point. If they couldn\u2019t, then arithmetic too could not apply inside a singularity, since the number \u201ctwo\u201d couldn\u2019t even exist\u2014there could never be any \u201ctwo\u201d of anything!\nAnyway, arithmetic as we know it\u2014that is, the arithmetic of limitless numbers\u2014definitely couldn\u2019t apply in a singularity: if at all, only the arithmetic of finite numbers could apply, and even that is doubtful. And since arithmetic is the basis of all mathematics, most of the rest of math couldn\u2019t apply either.\nAnd as Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead have \u201crigorously\u201d demonstrated in their magnum opus Principia Mathematica, logic itself (at least in its symbolic form, namely logic written in a kind of shorthand) is, from a larger perspective, just an aspect of mathematics. So logic as we know it couldn\u2019t apply inside a singularity either.\nBut as we have seen above, in an infinitely large universe, singularities can also be infinitely big. Therefore, somewhere in those infinitely huge singularities there could well be extensive zones where two plus two never make four, and triangles have six-and-a-half sides. Or localities where the speed of light is neither constant nor a universal limit. Or regions where eggs always spontaneously unscramble themselves, and broken teacups repair themselves without any glue. Or spaces where gravity is repellent and light is dark\u2014thus causing our night sky to be black, and our gravity to be (locally) attractive.\nThis means, indeed, that there could be, in an infinite universe, enormous stretches of time and space where none of the laws of science and the principles of mathematics as we humans know them\u2014or, for that matter, even the principles of Vulcan logic\u2014can apply at all!\nSo it shouldn\u2019t come as a total surprise to find, somewhere out there in the infinite vastness, a lamp which, when rubbed, sends forth a genial Genie sounding very much like our own Robin Williams, offering to fulfil any three of your wishes, and singing: \u201cYou Never Had A Friend Like Me\u201d.\nWhat? Any three wishes? No provisos, no quid pro quo\u2019s? Well, as we have demonstrated from the above, in an infinite universe, anything that can exist must exist, while if anything can\u2019t exist, it may exist. But since it may exist\u2014which is to say, has a likelihood of existing\u2014it means, once again, that it must exist! \u201cMr Aladdin, Sir, what will your pleasure be? Let me take your order, jot it down ... if it is possible it is done, while if it is impossible it shall be done!\u201d\nSo if there is the least likelihood of a Genie\u2014or for that matter, even God Almighty\u2014existing: or, as we have seen, even if there is no such likelihood!\u2014then both the Genie of the Lamp and the Good Lord Himself have got to have an existence in an infinite universe! (This might be taken as a kind of mathematical \u201cproof\u201d of the existence of God, though not a very good proof I\u2019m afraid, because one first needs to prove that the universe itself is infinite, and that doesn\u2019t seem to be all that easy to do).\nActually, according to our argument above, if the universe really is infinite, even to say that the universe is infinite\u2014that is, to tell the exact truth\u2014becomes meaningless. Thus we\u2019ve just had the pleasure of proving logically, that everything we have proved logically above must be meaningless\u2014which is as absurd a conclusion as ever I heard.\nNot, mind you, that this argument demonstrates that the universe is not, in point of fact, infinite. It simply demonstrates that if it is infinite, our saying so has no meaning, and thus our statement can\u2019t be true. On the other hand, of course, if the universe isn\u2019t actually infinite, our saying that it is infinite would definitely not be true. So one way or another, we can never truthfully say that the universe is infinite, even if it actually is so!\nOnce you start thinking like this\u2014as the nineteenth century mathematician Georg Cantor did\u2014it is but a short step to the loony bin ... where Cantor himself ended up. So it is not surprising that most astrophysicists and cosmologists\u2014whose business it is to at least try and think big\u2014are shying away from thinking about the universe as being that big.\nBut it can get even bigger than that (if anything bigger could be imagined!) That\u2019s because if a real infinity is anything like the theoretical infinities of which we have some limited understanding in this finite world, then even bigger things are implied.\nFor instance, a finite line in geometry, no matter how short, is regarded as having an infinite number of points along it. (Finally, a kind of infinity we can think about without going bonkers!) Now any line can be divided into two; and each of those two lines must also have an infinite number of points along it. Moreover, each of the two lines can also be divided into two; and each of those two into two, too ... again and again, ad infinitum. So an infinite number of lines can be produced from any single finite line, each of those infinite number of lines having an infinite number of points along it. (One doesn\u2019t actually have to cut up and separate the lines; one may say, instead, that any single finite line can contain an infinite number of smaller lines, and each of those smaller lines contains an infinite number of points).\nAnd an infinitely long line can always be cut up into two lines, each infinitely long; and each of those can be cut up into two infinitely long lines, and so on and on.\nAnd of course, what applies to one-dimensional lines also applies to two-dimensional surfaces, three-dimensional volumes, four-dimensional space-times, five-dimensional whatchamacallums, and so on. All this is standard undergraduate math, confirmed by any relevant text book on the subject.\nBut now here comes the weird part: if a really infinite universe is anything at all like this, then not only must it contain an infinite number of finite universes, it must also contain an infinite number of infinite universes! And each of those must contain an infinite number of infinite universes, each of which would also contain an infinite number of infinite universes ... on and on, ad infinitum: a \u201cladder\u201d of infinities without beginning or end, \u201ctop\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d. Which means that our infinite universe must be on one of the intermediate rungs, so to speak, of the infinitely long \u201cladder\u201d of infinite universes, and that there would have to be an infinite number of infinite universes infinitely larger than our own ... and also an infinite number of infinite universes infinitely smaller than our own! If that doesn\u2019t boggle the mind I\u2019d like to know what does. (I mean, we\u2019re talkin\u2019 reality here, dude, not some abstract mathematical concept).\nEND QUOTE", "The Universe is not expanding, it has always been infinite.

Research conducted over numerous cases were then considered to be empirirical studies which somehow gave it the scientific acceptance within that grouping of researchers,but not the entire scientific community. In my opinion, the scientific status of psychology is not true. There is no real empirical evidence relating to the mind. Psychology depends on theories and human cases supposedly exhibiting the hallmark symptomatic behavior patterns. It then hinges its findings on people anecdotes (a word disliked in science) This is why mentally ill people generally find it difficult to be treated with prospects of recovery as in medical cases. Science has insufficient knowledge of the mind, hence its half acceptance of empirical studies when there is a hint of faith or beliefs. This acceptance or rejection also depends on the faith or beliefs of the scientist.\nEmpirical studies of reincarnation have the same value as psychology. But, likewise it is not proof. Proof that reincarnation is a truth is only what those who want to believe accept. If one\u2019s religion or beliefs rejects reincarnation, then, there is no chance that any study or research can prove it.\nAll being said and done what does it matter what others believe?

Loosing sight of this makes learning harder because you will search for a kind of complexity of language instead of something that earnestly makes ideas digestible. You begin in a dumb state, working with simple language and in order to confirm you are not just working with fumes and bullshit, you seek a dumb state that is easy to think through and confirm.

Prior to this work, it was generally held that there were two kinds of motion: violent motion, when an object is pulled away from its natural position, and natural motion, when an object returns to its natural position. The simplest version of this held that the natural position of something depended on its composition of the five elements. A rock was made mostly of the element earth, so its position was below water, hence rocks sink. If you throw a rock in the air, it flies until it runs out of violent motion, at which time it falls, well, like a rock. Galileo pointed out some flaws in this idea. First, if something is sitting on a table on a ship sailing on smooth waters, is it moving or not? How would you tell? Second, the observed motion of flying objects doesn't match the \u201cruns out of motion then drops\u201d idea. Galileo observed cannonballs in Venice. Finally, if we start a ball rolling down a ramp, across a table and up another ramp, the ball wii rise to the same height from which it was launched. So make the second ramp have a gentler slope, and the ball wii go farther in the horizontal direction before reaching the launch height. So what if we make the ramp have zero incline, i.e. flat?

But few Aerogel: The lightest solid known to man\nThis remarkable gel is the world's lightest solid.\nSince its invention in 1931\nby American scientist Samuel Kistler, it has been used in space missions to collect dust from a comet's tail, by government agencies for developing insulated tents, and even for manufacturing clothing that protects a person from extreme heat.\nNASA has nicknamed it \"Blue Smoke\"\nbecause it kind of looks like a hologram.\nWhat makes this substance so cool lies in its seemingly paradoxical properties, Quora user Abhinash Tummala writes. This hard gel is mostly air and therefore extremely lightweight, not unlike a sponge. But it is also very good at repelling heat. As you can see in the image below, it can protect a flower from a strong flame.\nAerogel provides incredible insulation and protection from heat. Wikimedia Commons\nThe individual molecules that make up aerogel can also act like mini baseball gloves \u2014 they can capture fast-moving particles without damaging them. This was really useful during NASA's Stardust mission\n.\nScientists fashioned silica-based aerogel\nonto a massive tennis-racket-shaped collector that sat outside its Stardust spacecraft. Its purpose was to capture fragile particle fragments trailing behind the Comet Wild 2 without damaging them. Because aerogel is strong and relatively transparent, scientists were then able to easily find and extract the particles later for analysis.\nAerogel's precursor is structurally similar to Jell-O\n. The gelatin powder in Jell-O forms a flexible, liquid solution when mixed with warm water, which then cools into a stiff, tangled network\nthat chemically looks like an unruly ball of yarn and sets into a shape. But, if you heated the set Jell-O, it would dry out and you'd be left with a lump of Jell-O powder once again.\nAerogel, on the other hand, isn't made of gelatin but is made from one of a variety of substances\n, depending upon its desired use. Most commonly it is manufactured from silica\n, the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust\n. Unlike the process of making Jell-O, wet aerogel is put through a cycle of pressurized cooling and heating, which makes it retain its shape after drying out.\nThe resulting aerogel is mostly air, making it still a solid but extremely lightweight. It is often described as feeling like Styrofoam or that flaky, green foam that fake plants are potted in.\nYou can make your own aerogel by following one of these recipes\n.\nGallium: The metal that melts at room temperature\nAs Quora user Xu Beixi writes, this soft, shimmering solid metal is quite unusual.

Nice question. I guess that what led you to phrase it is that when you add and subtract complex numbers, you can also write them as 2d vectors on the real field, and do the operations component by component. So you could as well use real valued 2d vectors. You can as well build a correspondence between 2d real valued vectors and complex numbers to be able to multiply and divide them. In other words, you can do calculus with both (or algebra).\nSo, from this point of view, that\u2019s a legitimate way of thinking. By the way, it does not restrict to quantum mechanics, but physics in general. But, there is a but, one could pursue his line of thoughts and say, well, let\u2019s go higher in dimensions, and build 3d complex numbers, i.e. short cut a tedious 3d real vectors algebra with fancy numbers. You cannot. The only way to do algebra, as the one inherited from the set of real numbers, is in 1d (the real numbers), and 2d (the complex numbers).\nSo that\u2019s a not so obvious observation I guess.\nThen comes the specific point of your question; why complex numbers in quantum mechanics? Well, as soon as you have realised the point I raised before, you are free to go doing cumbersome calculations and injecting 2d real valued vectors within other vectors, or matrices. But I don\u2019t see the point in doing that. And remember that once you have built a correspondance between these 2d real valued vectors and complex numbers, well, you are just using the same objects but with different representations (the mapping is iso-morphic).\nTo sum up (if I got well the meaning of your question).\n1 - using 2d real valued vectors is using complex numbers, modulo a different representation: algebra is the same.\n2 - there is no way to build the equivalent for greater dimensions. (look at quaternions for instance; you loose commutativity on the way)", "It\u2019s not a \u201cbenefit\u201d, it\u2019s a requirement.\nComplex numbers can be thought of as elements of a two-dimensional vector space over the real numbers, but a two-dimensional vector space over the real numbers is not an algebra. It doesn\u2019t have multiplication of vectors by each other.\nNow you have two options.\nEither you keep it as just that, a real vector space. In this case, you\u2019re lacking an important structure which quantum mechanics really needs. So, you can do a heck of a lot of linear algebra, but you can\u2019t write down the most basic rules of quantum mechanics. These rules incorporate the multiplication of complex numbers.\nThe state of a quantum-mechanical system is described by a vector in a complex vector space, and operations on that state (like time evolution, or measurement of physical quantities) use the algebra of complex numbers. Look at the description of any of the simplest QM models: the quantum harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen atom, any system representing a qubit. You\u2019ll see complex numbers everywhere.\nThe other option is to define a multiplication of two vectors in your vector space, mimicking the usual product rule for complex numbers. That\u2019s perfectly fine, and now you have an algebra over the reals which is isomorphic to the complex numbers. You can still, if it helps, think of the elements of this space as \u201creal-valued vectors\u201d, by which you likely mean vectors with real components. But you didn\u2019t really sidestep complex numbers: you actually use them, with a different name.\nMultiplication is a binary operation. Picking any fixed complex number (or vector), multiplication by that fixed number is a linear transformation. So you can also \u201cignore\u201d binary multiplication and just think of infinitely many linear operators on a real vector space. Formally, you won\u2019t need to utter the words \u201ccomplex\u201d. Effectively, once again, you\u2019re doing complex multiplication.\nIt\u2019s a glorious and wondrous discovery, that the most basic laws of the universe are best captured with complex numbers. Really, it\u2019s amazing.

The constant vector is the limit speed in the observable universe ( we know it as the speed of light)\nIn my opinion, the complex numbers could be a useful tool but for the second image.", "The short explanation: you get interference effects if you use complex numbers.\nThe longer explanation: The Schr\u00f6dinger equation looks a lot like a halfway point between two other famous partial differential equations in physics: the wave equation and the heat equation.\nThe wave equation:\n[math]\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} \\tag*{}[/math]\nThe heat equation:\n[math]\\displaystyle D \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} \\tag*{}[/math]\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation:\n[math]\\displaystyle -i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial t^2} + U(x,t)\\psi(x,t) \\tag*{}[/math]\nThe wave equation describes oscillations in space and time (waves interfering with each other). The second derivative with respect to time is the essential component that gets you this oscillatory behavior. [math](\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\\sin(t)=-\\sin(t))[/math]\nThe heat equation (and the more general Fokker-Planck equation) describes the time-evolution of a probability density through time. This behavior basically comes out of the first derivative with respect to time. The first derivative get\u2019s you relaxation/growth behavior, not oscillatory behavior. [math](\\frac{d}{dt}e^t=e^t)[/math]\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation, due to the use of [math]i[/math] next to the time differential, describes BOTH [math](\\frac{d}{dt}e^{it}=i e^{it})[/math]. It describes a probability density evolving in time, and it describes how individual waves interfere to make up that probability density. Physically, you can think of a quantum particle, like an electron, as some charge distribution moving through space that can interfere with other particle distributions and even with itself (think double-slit experiment)! The Schr\u00f6dinger equation, through its use of complex numbers, merely mathematically represents this process. In fact, it was in postulating how to mathematically describe matter as a propogating wave, that led Schr\u00f6dinger to his famous wave equation, complex numbers and all. https://web.archive.org/web/20081217040121/http://home.tiscali.nl/physis/HistoricPaper/Schroedinger/Schroedinger1926c.pdf\nOne of the most beautiful conceptual pictures of quantum mechanics is to think of it as just a generalization of the laws of probability that allows for interference effects. This picture is very popular in the fields of quantum computation and quantum information theory.\nI thought I should also mention that people worry about the use of complex numbers far too much. Complex numbers aren\u2019t that different from 2-dimensional real vectors. Complex numbers really are just 2D vectors that use a slightly different inner product than real 2D vectors. They have many very nice properties real numbers do not. In physics we go through extra steps to TRY to get to use complex numbers, as they often make solving problems much easier.

We already know how to do industrial scale carbon capture and sequestration. It isn\u2019t rocket science. The problem is that putting the capture equipment on a coal or natural gas source raises the cost of the plant 35%, and the energy required to compress the post-combustion CO2 sufficiently to force it into an underground reservoir a mile or so underground (which is shorthand for \u201cdeep enough to sequester the stuff long enough to matter\u201d) requires 40% of the output of the plant.\nThat 40% can also be described as increasing the cost of the power output from the plant by 40%. And since coal generation is already so expensive that no one is building any new coal plants, you can see how adding 75% (35% plus 40%) to the price of the power from a new coal plant won\u2019t get past the pencil stage.\nThis is similarly true for natural gas, and for existing plants which have already paid off their original construction cost, but are still struggling to remain competitive. The fact of the matter, which is extraordinary good news for everyone except people who can\u2019t think of anything to do other than to work at or own aging fossil or nuclear plants, is that in the last three years the cost of wind and utility scale solar generation has dropped so much that it is now cheaper to build new wind and solar just about everywhere in the world, than it is to continue using existing coal, natural gas or nuclear plants.\nAnd adding 35% or more to the cost of those old plants isn\u2019t economically viable. In most parts of the world the electric grid is dispatched on the basis of cost. There are a few other factors, but as everyone knows, superior efficiency has made natural gas a better option for power generation than coal or nuclear or petroleum products, and now natural gas has lost its lead to wind and utility scale solar (rooftop solar is another story - operates in a different economic context).\nThere are a few living examples that are close enough to real sequestration that we have high confidence in these costs. Some utilities take CO2 from coal plants and inject it into active oil and gas fields. This is called \u201cEnhanced Oil Recovery\u201d. Although they like to pretend it\u2019s the same as sequestration, it\u2019s not, simply because the formations which have been fractured and drilled are no longer capable of retaining the CO2 for the requisite several thousand years. And since the result of the practice is to bring more oil or gas out of the naturally sequestered state which made it a fossil fuel in the first place, there is no net benefit.\nAnother example is in the North Sea, where the oil and gas comes out of the sea floor with a lot of CO2, which is liquid at the depths they are drilling. Some of the oil companies have found a simple way to separate the liquid CO2 and pump it back into the sea floor. This eliminates the expensive and energy-intensive step of compression, and prevents a large, lesser known source of CO2. It is a benign process, but hopefully we can just shut the entire operation down pretty soon.\nThe last thing I think is worth mentioning is the process of using atmospheric or post-emission CO2 to make new liquid or gas hydrocarbons. The chemistry has been known for more than a century. What\u2019s new is that the electricity needed to hydrolyze water has become cheap enough that we can do this at an affordable cost compared to using fossil fuels. Search for Carbon Engineering. Interestingly, Carbon Engineering takes advantage of the fact that atmosphere and open water remain in balance as far as CO2 goes, and they extract their carbon from the same water they hydrolyze. I\u2019m not sure if their process is proprietary, so it may not be possible to tell much more about it from their website, but there are a lot of similar efforts. I refer people to this one because the website is pretty useful.\nWe don\u2019t have a mature industrial process yet. This is all too new, especially the potential to generate very cheap electricity from wind and utility scale solar projects. Processes like this will achieve their ultimate lowest cost when we have enough wind and solar to produce more power than is needed at a significant fraction of the time. For solar, this means we need to have more solar capacity than our total peak consumption at the time of day when all the air conditioners are running. In other words, at least eight to ten years from now if we are smart. For wind, we need to have at least about 70% of today\u2019s electricity coming from wind before we have enough excess to make the very cheapest renewable hydrocarbon fuels. There are a couple of other industrial chemical processes which are going to compete for that cheap power too.\nThe big problem is that taking carbon out of the air or water to make fuel isn\u2019t sequestration - unless you plan to pump the fuel into the ground and never use it.\nSo ultimately, the answer to your question is: we have it now, but we don\u2019t have a systematic process which has a remote promise of paying enough to do it on a scale that matters. All the biological processes are more likely to gain the funding than any of the mechanical/chemical processes.\nThere was talk about a new approach to making concrete which actually absorbed CO2 instead of being a source a few years ago. I\u2019m the sort of spoilsport who actually does the math, and I calculated that it would be possible to absorb all the CO2 we emit in a year with this new cement, if we built a full scale model of California out of it. One more time, I\u2019m not holding my breath.\nWe will first use dirt cheap renewable electricity to eliminate fossil fuels - not because it is logical, but because it is the economic pecking order. Efficiency continues to be cheaper than generation, but after spending 35 years trying to get people interested in saving six to ten dollars for every dollar they spend on efficiency technology, I\u2019m not going to kid myself or anyone else. People find wind and solar more exciting than efficiency. Rooftop solar is about two to three times as expensive as utility scale solar, but we still see about 30% of all our solar going onto rooftops. Maybe more in other countries. 60% of all solar panels in 2018 went to developing nations.\nSo I hope that some people will get serious about reforestation, reversing desertification and enhancing agricultural soil carbon content, while I spend most of my time trying to speed the rate of new efficiency, wind and solar. I see no economic pathway to full scale industrial sequestration, and if we can\u2019t get people to save billions of dollars every year with efficiency, what logical hope is there that we could get people to spend billions of dollars every year on industrial sequestration? It is a lot more reasonable to simply stop using fossil fuels (and nuclear power, which is too expensive to replace the existing plants, much less build a lot of new ones).\nThat is, in reality, what is happening.

We need many other medical technologies as well as treatments for coronavirus but at the moment we have a global need to solve the same problem. Often people in different regions need different things. This may be for climatic or cultural reasons.\nWe have the resources to develop a great many different things at once.\nThe biggest example is WW2. Many countries developed many different weapons and technologies. Many attempts failed but some became highly successful. In a period of 6 years, the world saw a revolution of many different technologies.\nBritain was highly innovative during WW2 but it did lack resources to develop many ideas. One problem they had was to find a way of producing penicillin. The British shared a large number of technologies with the US. This allowed the US to develop even better technologies and in many cases doing it very rapidly and very well. Penicillin was one of the most amazing shared projects. The US had the resources needed to develop a method of producing penicillin in huge quantities. It was a revolution in medical science and save hundreds of millions of lives. The development of Penicillin also encouraged the development of many other medications. Including a large number of different antibiotics that had different advantages and different benefits. Some antibiotics were better at treating different virus types.\nOther examples in WW2 included jet engines, rockets, and radars. One group of scientists and engineers were able to develop a very small kind of radar. This radar could tell how far away an object or the ground was. They developed proximity fuses that could be used to shoot down aircraft or allow artillery shells to explode above ground which was often a very effective way of attacking targets.\nThe British had worked with Poland ad France to develop technology for breaking German codes. The US found other ways of decoding secret Japanese signals. This gave the allies a massive advantage over Germany and Japan. They could often find vital information.\nBefore WW2 the US Navy had developed one modern torpedo. This was developed by one group of people. When the war started they had only one type of torpedo. After many months of combat with the Japanese, it was realized that the torpedoes were not working effectively. Many navy commanders wanted the torpedoes fixed. The group in charge of making the torpedo refused to do testing or try to improve the design of the torpedo. They repeatedly told the navy that the torpedoes worked well. Many submarine captains were blamed for not sinking Japanese ships. It Torpedo group had only tested 2 torpedos before putting them into production. One of those torpedoes failed. So in the testing, 50% of the torpedoes failed in a controlled test. In wartime conditions, the torpedoes were much worse. Eventually, the Navy forced the torpedo developers to fix the torpedoes. But thousands of lives had already been lost due to faulty torpedoes. By the end of the war a number of companies developed better torpedoes for the navy. Including a self-guiding torpedo that could sink submarines underwater. This was a clear example of one group focusing on one project and failed. Luckily this type of problem was not common. Many very capable new weapons were designed and tested and some were very successful. Though most of these projects failed the US was still able to develop war-winning technologies.\nWe have the resources too develop many technologies. And we now have many scientists around the world developing different ways of defeating coronavirus. We may only need to successful projects that could save millions of lives.

It happens to be a technical chore that is much more complicated than going to the moon.\nAlso you may not know it but the common cold as much as we hate it may in fact be the best thing that ever happened to mankind. One of its features is that it carries around genetic material borrowed from other virus and it gets your immune system exposed and strong without you catching the really nasty germs first. Yes it works somewhat like an automatic vaccination distribution lab and nobody has to run it. It may be why the COVID-19 epidemic is much less than anticipated. That\u2019s right! You may have had your life saved by a nasty cold you hated. It happens all the time.\nI would suggest you get deep into science and learn all you can but be very careful at the problems you try to solve. There may be a really good reason people have that problem and you may cause more problems by getting rid of the problem than you solve.

Then use a term (\u201cEvolution\u201d) that doesn\u2019t distinguish the real science from the naturalistic science-fiction.\nYou see, most of the theory is based on things no one disputes like heredity, natural selection, and mutations. The real question though is can these entities create novel and useful genes, structures, and body plans?\nEmpirically, there is no reason to believe they can.\nWe know selection only reduces genetic variability. It actually eliminates genes/traits/alleles from populations. Just like you could breed wolves into Yorkshire terriers but you could never breed Yorkies back to wolves. They\u2019ve lost alleles!\nHeredity does a great job at mixing genes/traits/alleles that already existed in a population leading to a wide range of phenotypes (species). But heredity alone cannot create anything new, genetically speaking.\nMutations are the only entity that could create new genes, structures, body plans. But what do we see empirically? We see mutations degrading information, causing defects, disease, and inactivating genes (loss of function).\nThen there\u2019s common physiology, biochemistry, and anatomy. But these provide as good evidence for common Design as they do common descent.\nOf course naturalists will point to things that aren\u2019t perfect and say \u201clook at all the bad design!\u201d. But the field of Biomimicry hasn\u2019t grown into a multibillion dollar industry because of all the bad designs in nature.\nAnd everyone agrees this world isn\u2019t perfect. No one said it is. No one said it\u2019s supposed to be. And that\u2019s all explained right there in Genesis\u2014just like it has been for thousands of years.\nBottom line is that the actual empirical evidence suggests highly, even supernaturally, intelligent design (appendix). If you cannot/will not believe in the supernatural despite the evidence at least realize this is just a logically fallacious \u201cargument from incredulity\u201d.\nAppendix (Evidence for Intelligent Design).\n1. The CODE of DNA. All symbolic codes come from intelligence. And DNA is the most unfathomably complex code ever discovered. To say such a code could arise naturally defies the principles of information science.\n2. We know (as best we can since it\u2019s a fundamental principle of Biology) that life naturally only comes from other life. To our knowledge the law of Biogenesis has never been broken. The origin of life therefore implicates intentional and purposeful design.\n3. The Cambrian explosion. In a geological blink of an eye nearly every major animal phyla appears in the fossil record. The morphological (body plan) disparity of life in the Cambrian was equivalent to what we find in nature today. If the entire (naturalistic) history of Earth were condensed to a 24 hour period the Cambrian explosion occurred over a 2 min span in the 21st hour. This isn\u2019t slow gradual change.\n4. Protein folding. You cannot gradually morph a protein into something both novel and beneficial. If you change a gene or amino acid sequence too much you get a drastic and dramatic change in folding of the protein (or more likely no folding at all). The organism doesn\u2019t gain function it manages to survive or goes extinct. The likelihood of random amino acid sequences making a functional protein fold is implausible unless intentional.\n5. The field on Biomimicry has become a multi-billion dollar industry. This isn\u2019t because there is only the appearance of design in nature as Dawkins suggests.\n6. Epigenetic Adaptation. Organisms have the built-in ability to turn on and off genes in response to a wide range of environments and environmental pressures. They can survive/thrive in an environment they or their ancestors may have never experienced.\n7. Orphan genes. Some organisms have as much as 20% of their genomes being entirely unique. Genes not shared with any other species. Not even with their closest relatives. Genes from scratch.\n8. Pleiotropy. One gene can control several unrelated phenotypic traits. Gradual change in one would destroy function of another.\n9. Overlapping genes. An overlapping gene is a gene whose expressible nucleotide sequence partially overlaps with the expressible nucleotide sequence of another gene. In this way, a nucleotide sequence may make a contribution to the function of one or more gene products. These cannot gradually accumulate. All or nothing and need to be master-planned from start. Some genes are triple, quadruple, quintuple, and even sextuple overlapping! Try gradually evolving those in a protein universe that\u2019s infinite with only ~4,000 folds used biologically in nature.\n10. Turns out there are 33 different genetic codes! You can\u2019t gradually change your entire coding system.\n11. The genome of E. Coli. It\u2019s organization appears master planned. Not modified in patchwork fashion as would be predicted by gradual small \u201cjust good enough\u201d changes over millions of years.\nOf course, some will scoff at certain items on this list. But just ask yourself or your naturalistic neighbor what\u2019s the best evidence you got that nature made life (or anything for that matter)? Or that small errors over time can create novel and useful body plans?", "Because of religion. The religion that convicted Galileo of heresy when he said the earth orbits around the sun.", "Wherever there is evidence, it points to secular explanations. In the many places evidence is lacking, we cannot say for sure how or why things happened, but when we can test the phenomenon, creationism fails.\nThe problem most creationists who are also scientists have is that they have signed statements of faith forbidding them from accepting evolution. It may be that evolution proponents, in a grassroots way, have a similar bias against creationism but in creationism, it is clear and documented.\nCreationist Statements of faith\nAnd so creationists are unable to admit evidence contradicting them exists.", "Creationists refute the evidence of the science of evolution. Evolution is a verified Theory and continues to be improved upon by science, especially through the examination of DNA.", "Do creationists simply refuse to acknowledge the evidence for evolution or is the evidence of evolution, in reality, severely lacking?\nEvidence is a red herring in this question. This is all about worldview and personal identity. If you are a creationist then god created the world and everything else, end of story. This is not only a belief, it is an key part of your identity. Any attack on creationism is, by extension, a personal attack on you, the believer. For creationists this question bypasses the rational part of the brain that values evidence and goes straight for the primitive tribal part that says \u201cmess with me and I'll mess you up!\u201d\nDon't waste your time presenting creationists with evidence, it doesn't work, they have to find their own way out of the religious quagmire they're in.", "Well, well, well. This is an interesting question. one that cuts into much of the heart of the problem.\nTo start out, obviously, most will pick the side of the question based on their belief system. If you are a Young-Earther, evolution makes no sense and it is easy to jump on the lack of evidence. If you do accept evolution, then it is easy to jump on the belief that those people refuse to acknowledge the evidence.\nDuh, right? But what is the truth? What would the real answer be?\nFirst of all, I only know enough to know how much I don\u2019t know. So, I can write this answer based on the conversations I\u2019ve heard, the arguments people have given, and what bits of knowledge I\u2019ve scrapped together. If the following rings false to you I\u2019m happy to hear your counter-arguments in the comments so long as you can keep them on topic and polite.\nFirst of all, let me start by angering the pro-evolution crowd. Science does not have all the answers.\nRight? We do not know everything yet. We are still learning, discovering, disproving, and proving ideas every day. If I walk up to a Ph.D. in evolutionary science and asked for the absolute proof we have for evolution, he/she would have a large number of tools to work with.\nThey can teach me about the fossil record. They could show me an example of incremental development in living animals. They could give a quick overview of genetics and how we can track evolutionary changes through DNA. There are easily a couple of dozen ways to start this conversation with them.\nFor some people this is logical. Either they do not have an instilled belief in a religion or their belief is flexible enough to add context to the knowledge as they gain it.\nBut, each of the above things involves time, willingness to learn, the acceptance of things I cannot see, the faith in the words of other scientist\u2019s observations were correct, and the foundation of knowledge in scientific principles to grasp the significance all the pieces of evidence put together make.\nFor some people, again, this is easy and asking them to have the faith the knowledge the textbooks and teachers are giving them is the truth, even if they do not have a good science foundation, either because they do not have an instilled belief in a religion or they are flexible enough in their belief to use it to add context to the new knowledge.\nWhat this hypothetical Ph.D. cannot do is point to a single thing and show me, a completely uneducated layman, indisputable proof of evolution I could understand immediately.\nThis is the challenge science has and it is something that cannot be done yet and until there is this mythical thing in a box someone without the right education can look at and go, \u201cOh hey. That is evolution. Awesome!\u201d then there will always be a dilemma explaining something as complex as evolution theory to someone in two minutes.\nOn the Young Earth side. It is easy.

It doesn\u2019t require a special education outside of the belief of a God and for a majority of people in many nations that is something instilled since birth.\nThis is why faith is such a hard thing to dissect because both sides require it. You have to have faith your teacher is correct; you have to have faith the facts in a textbook or journal are real. You have to have faith a published paper was peer-reviewed properly. This is why so many Young Earther\u2019s dismiss science as a religion. Unless you are on the team who conducted the research and wrote the paper you have to have faith the information is right.\nNow, at this point, some people will hit the logic breaks and ask the question. \u201cIf both sides rely on faith, how could one be better than the other?\u201d or \u201cIf X is all faith then why can\u2019t they accept Y.\u201d Well, there actually is a very stark contrast between the sides.\nOn one hand, in science, the faith I talked about can be tested. Every concept can be challenged. Every experiment recreated; every fact can be scrutinized. God cannot be tested or challenged, or even questioned. God is all faith.\nOn the other hand, religion offers absolutes science usually cannot. How did life begin? Science has theories. a fair amount of evidence, and some really good ideas. But there is not an absolute answer yet. God, however, is an absolute. God did it.\nSo, I present you with an answer that is lacking the one-sided clear-cut answer on one side or the other.\nBoth.\nThe evidence for evolution requires effort, education, time, and willingness. The evidence of evolution is accessible so long as they are willing and able to dig into the hill knowledge and have things like local libraries, or good teachers, or the internet, or some kind of broadcast media. But it is not easy enough anyone can do it or has the time to do or access to the tools to even begin digging.\nSo, it is easy to refuse to accept what evidence has been found so far because of the barriers to access what each piece of evidence means. So, it also means easy, identifiable, and indisputable evidence is lacking.\nIt takes considerably more mental gymnastics to understand science than simply settling into a belief system you already have in place and accepting\u2026\nGod did it.\nOriginal question: Do creationists simply refuse to acknowledge the evidence for evolution or is the evidence of evolution, in reality, severely lacking?", "If you\u2019ve been following me for the last many months, you know how I keep begging for an evolutionist to provide a specific \u2018missing link\u2019. They make lots of general claims and recently many have begun mocking and insulting me - which I take as a compliment implying they can no longer attack my arguments. If you find any actual evidence for evolution, please let me know. Thanks.", "It's the first one. Creationist simply refuse to acknowledge the science. That is the answer to your question if you really wanted an answer.\nThere are two antithetical Concepts at at work here. The concept of science vs fantasy.", "The physical evidence from the fossil record is very subjective and equivocal at best. We just do not know if a T.Rex had a common ancestor to a fish or frog..or any organism. The theory of Evolution imposes an explanation on the T.Rex, but it offers no demonstration. It requires you to believe common descent in general, based on a small set of very unimpressive modern observations on E.coli antibiotic resistance and the sizes of finch beaks. Quite a leap!\nSo in this sense, the evidence for Evolution is lacking. We need to see a demonstration of the large claim of common descent.\nSo I'm a creationist, and I acknowledge variation. But without evidence of macro Evolution, we are not compelled by the assertion of common descent.\nMy question is, why do Evolutionists ignore the affirmation that Darwin made in Chapter 1 of his 1859 \u201cOrigins\" book\u2026the affirmation that domestication of animals and plants is an effective and observed means of speciation? And having accepted that confession, they might extrapolate that to support Creationism and intelligent design?\nCreationism and ID are axioms for the origin of complex systems. Biology, being a complex system, could certainly be explained by Creationism and ID. That is what Darwin admitted to, and so do I.", "Evidence for Evolution is severely lacking? You have to be kidding me. Except that I know you are not. And you are trying to understand why creationists refuse to acknowledge the evidence.\nLet me state, FOR THE RECORD (I want EVERYONE to understand) that The Theory of Evolution is one of the most supported of ALL scientific theories, based on the TREMENDOUS amount of evidence, research, experiments and accurate predictions that it has made. \u2018Evolution\u2019 is not going anywhere. After 160 years and the efforts of some of the best scientific minds in the world, NOBODY has been able to come up with a theory that even comes close to replacing it.\nNow, perhaps part of the problem is that evolution has TWO PARTS:\nThe actual act of Evolution. Things change. Things evolve. People have observed this going on right in front of our eyes, for thousands of years.\nThe THEORY that explains WHAT is happening with the act of Evolution, and WHY.\nEven most creationists will usually accept the first part of this. They will often (though not always) agree that evolution is happening. Things change. Yep. Sometimes they will dispute that this is happening because of changes in genes and genetic frequencies, but for the most part they agree it happens.\nHOWEVER, Science says that the observed evolution we see just goes on and on, that it has gone on for billions of years and will continue on into the future, as long as life exists, and that it will, therefore, cause MAJOR CHANGES in organisms over time. But the creationists DENY THIS. They kind of say, \u201cHow do YOU know? Were you there?\u201d Which is one of the most stupid things you can say in science. NOBODY needs to be present, in science to actually OBSERVE most things as they are happening. In fact, IN SCIENCE DIRECT OBSERVATIONS ARE OFTEN WRONG. We tend to learn MUCH MORE by observing the records, and the evidence. The earth and the universe is like an open book, if you just have the skill and knowledge to read it. Geological, Astrophysical and Biological evidence, including the records from the earth itself, tell us what is happening with evolution and what has happened in the past.\nThe creationists think they are clever, and they come up with the idea of what they call \u2018micro-evolution,\u2019 meaning this small changes that would be stupid to deny, but then they separate that out from what the call \u2018macro-evolution\u2019 which means all the things that they DO want to deny. In other words, they have no trouble with evolution causing small changes, but the deny it can cause big changes.\nCreationism is not science. It does not work like science does. It is based on an a priori belief system, and then denying EVERYTHING that doesn\u2019t fit into that belief system, and most of science doesn\u2019t fit into it.\nIn science, there is no difference between small amounts of evolution and large amounts of evolution. Scientists who study evolution find NO EVIDENCE of any mechanism which could possibly PREVENT the accumulation of small amounts of evolution to lead to large amounts of evolution.\nWe do OBSERVE the small amounts of evolution everyday. This is not an exaggeration. We can measure those small evolutionary changes - for instance, look at what is happening right now as the COVID virus changes gradually, as it spreads around.\nAnd we observe the large amounts of evolution, in the earth\u2019s records including rocks and fossils and in the morphology and anatomy of different species and in the actual genes of living things. Large amounts of evolution are just the accumulation of small amounts of evolution.\nThere is no barrier between the two things - small amounts of evolution and large amounts of evolution - and no \u2018border\u2019 between them, except for enough TIME to accumulate all the changes to make the larger amounts, and TIME is something we know we do have, in the eartth.\nCreationists do run around trying to find barriers between small amounts of evolution and large amounts of evolution, and they fail spectacularly. It isn\u2019t just that they aren\u2019t scientists, so they don\u2019t know what they are doing, but they there just IS NO SUCH EVIDENCE. The best they can do is come up with some very WEAK mathematical models that are almost always made by middling scientists, who are almost never biologists. But the big trouble with these mathematical formulae is that they MUST make unproven assumptions, about rates of mutation, types of mutations, frequency of successful reproduction, the culling effect of variable survival and innumerable other things, and they just don\u2019t have the starting data and the measured figures. So, they GUESS at what they WANT, then make the calculations that support their view, then MODIFY the starting numbers as necessary to get what they want, and then try to call it science. And they wonder why the real scientists laugh at them.\nI am not going to go on and on, but in parting, just to help you understand, let me list a few of the other, very strongly supported scientific things that the creationists (or at least most creationists) ignore and deny:\nDeny the universe is ancient,13,800,000,000 years old. Which is MILLIONS of TIMES older than the creationists 6000 year belief. Hey guys, THERE IS NO POSSIBLE ROOM FOR THIS KIND OF ERROR IN MEASUREMENT.\nDeny the earth is 4,500,000,000 years old. We have excellent figures and excellent evidence from many many scientific tracks, that show this. This has NOTHING to do with the \u2018Evolutionists.\u2019 It is the work of generations of super smart Physicists, Astrophysicists, Geophysicists, Geologists, and many other fields, that have NOTHING to do with biology.\nDeny that older, simpler life is found in the most ancient layers of the earth, and more \u2018advanced\u2019 more complex life is in the upper layers, following a very steady, very observable progression. Do keep in mind, THERE IS NO CAMBRIAN RABBIT.\nDeny that dinosaurs are ancient. Creationists somehow try to claim that dinosaurs were contemporaneous with man, within the last 6000 years, because their BELIEF SYSTEM requires that. Not a single shred of scientific evidence, but they claim it over and over anyway. Hey, creationists, if the dinosaur bones we see come from all the dinosaurs that drowned in \u2018Noah\u2019s Flood\u2019 then why do we only find dinosaur bones in the ancient dinosaur beds. Why isn\u2019t there one single human bone, or cow, or - dare I say it, \u2018Cretaceous Rabbit\u2019 - found in these beds of bones, with the modern mammal bones mixed up with the dinosaurs.\nDeny that stars have been around for millions and billions of years. It takes billions of years for an average star to go through its \u2018Life Cycle\u2019 and reach the point where it might explode in a supernova, but we see supernova happening all the time, and the evidence of previous supernova extends billions of years into the past. But creationists, once again, without a shred of evidence of any kind, try to claim this all happened in the last 6000 years. Deny, deny, DENY!\nDeny that light has been travelling through space for billions of years, from galaxies billions of light years away, to just reach us now. If the universe were only 6000 years old, then every night you could go out and see the light from \u2018new stars\u2019 that were just on the edge of 6000 light years away, \u2018winking into existence,\u2019 as their light finally reached us.\nDeny that there is any such thing as a potentially beneficial mutation. This makes my jaw drop. We SEE it all the time.\nCLEARLY, the creationists have much bigger problems than denying the evidence for Evolution.\nI hope this helps answer the question about whether creationists DO simply refuse to acknowledge the real science and the real evidence for what the universe is like and how it works.", "In my experience, speaking someone who used to deny evolution, they claim that there is little to know legitimate evidence for evolution. I used to have a variety of arguments against evolution. I can remember the exact moment I changed my mind. I was assigned as a freshman biochem and molecular biology major to write a paper outlining a possible route of evolution of the human eye. I was initially indignant at the assignment, but I was a good student and so I started doing research. I quickly learned that most of my objections of evolution where based on fundamental misunderstandings of what the modern theory of evolution actually was. For example, I used to make the argument, \u201cIf speciation (evolution of one species into another) is a thing that actually occurs, then why can we not find intermediate transition forms in the fossil record? And if we do find them, how do we know they are not simply a separate extinct species?\u201d Now to my 18 yo brain with a poor grasp of evolutionary biology (I always was more a chemistry person) that seemed like a reasonable argument. Until you realize that everything is a transitional form. All organisms exists in a state of perpetual change. A modern dog is a transitional form between their ancestors and descendants. The very concept of a species itself is a somewhat arbitrary distinction.\nIn short, I believe that most of the people that deny evolution do so based on misunderstanding and lack of education. The solution to that? No clue. I am lucky enough that my parents instilled in me a desire to seek the truth and that I was able to change my mind when shown strong enough evidence. Another one of my university professors used to say, \u201cIf what you believe is true, you have nothing to fear from honest investigation and questioning. However, if what you believe is false, then is it not better to see that it is untrue and discard that belief?\u201d", "I should start by admitting I\u2019m not a creationist, so I have no genuine evidence for the first part of this question, but under the circumstances that\u2019s OK. Isn\u2019t it?\nI\u2019ll answer the second question first, to get it out of the way. The evidence for evolution is, in reality, copious. There is probably more evidence for evolution than any other scientific theory. Unfortunately, the process does usually take rather a long time. If your timeframe is restricted to a few thousand years, it takes a paradigm shift to believe something that you are told takes millions. This also makes it a bit difficult to demonstrate experimentally. You can\u2019t say: first you do this, then you do that, then you wait a couple of million years.\nBased on discussions I\u2019ve had with creationists, they have sufficient evidence for creation to satisfy themselves. Therefore evolution cannot be true no matter what the evidence might be. If you have a strong belief, no amount of evidence or logical reasoning to the contrary will be sufficient to change your mind, and why would you want to look too closely at something which contradicts your beliefs? I don\u2019t think they refuse to acknowledge the evidence for evolution so much as they don\u2019t even look at it properly.", "I am a Christian and I believe in a Creator, so I am a \u201cCreationist\u201d in a sense\u2026though I basically accept everything science has to say about the origin of organisms in this world.\nI often butt heads with YEC types, and in no situation have I ever found that any of them have even a semblance of a grasp on what the scientific claims actually are or what the evidences supporting those claims are. They can usually rattle off a few examples of evidences that are supposedly problematic, but they ignore the vast majority of evidence that exists, and they don\u2019t really know what exactly that evidence is purported to show or how it does so. It\u2019s just a crowd of straw-men, basically.", "It only seems so to American evangelicals in the Bible Belt.", "(I dislike the name creationist just like the name evolutionist, sounds like a cult)\nPeople believing in creation only argue against the evidence of evolution or say that it is made up.

Time is relative; how long ten minutes is depends on which side of the bathroom door that you\u2019re on.", "To believe in evolution with such a incomplete fossil record takes a giant leap of faith.Ive looked at the scant evidence for it ,the assumptions that are made based on very scant evidence ,I've come to a conclusion I DON\u2019T HAVE ENOUGH FAITH TO BE AN ATHEIST.!!!!!!!!!!!", "Q: Do creationists simply refuse to acknowledge the evidence for evolution or is the evidence of evolution, in reality, severely lacking?\nA: Here\u2019s what Answers in Genesis say:\nBy definition, no apparent, perceived or claimed evidence in any field, including history and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the scriptural record. Of primary importance is the fact that evidence is always subject to interpretation by fallible people who do not possess all information.\nSource: Statement of Faith\nThey simply define any evidence supporting evolution as invalid, since it contradicts the Bible, and claim that the only way to get \u201call information\u201d is through the Bible.", "I personally am a Christian and I believe that God uses scientific processes to change and create the world around us. I think that evolution only strengthens an argument for God. It shows he is always creating. Science and faith don\u2019t have to be diametrically opposed as some would try to have us believe.", "Creationists do not use the scientific method. They reason from a priori assumptions to conclusions instead reasoning from evidence to conclusions. This is good Aristotelian deductive logic. Aristotle made the a priori assumption that all things have a telos (an end or final purpose) and then concluded that the reason a rock falls to the earth when dropped is because the telos of rocks is to be at rest on the earth.\nCreationists make the a priori assumption that a supernatural deity exists and this deity created the heavens and the earth and all the species on the earth. Evidence is irrelevant to creationists. Scientists reject Aristotelian thinking and reason from evidence to conclusions.\nAt the Scopes monkey trial, Clarence Darrow put William Jennings Bryan on the witness stand as an expert on the Bible. Darrow asked Bryan if he had read On the Origin of the Species. Bryan said that he had no interest in the works of agnostic scientists because the Holy Scriptures told him what is true.\nScientists cannot reason with creationists because they reject Darwin because his evidence is materialistic. There is no mention of God in his book on the origin of the species and this drives creationists nuts.\nBut creationists are simply engaging in question begging. They beg the question: is there a supernatural creator who created all the species?\nWhen Napoleon met that great French scientist Laplace, he asked Laplace why there was no mention of God in his book on celestial mechanics. Laplace answered, \u201cSire, I have no need of that hypothesis.\u201d\nDarwin had no need of the creationist hypothesis that a supernatural deity created all the species on earth.", "The vast majority of creationists simply don't have any idea what evolution actually is. It's not so much that they refuse to acknowledge the evidence, but rather that they are arguing against a figment of their imagination.\nI have never met a creationist who can explain what he is arguing against.\nThe theory is actually so simple, and so obvious, that anyone who understands it recognizes that it must be correct. So the only way to argue against it is to claim that it is something other than it actually is. Variations exist, many of which are heritable, and some of those variations have a statistically significant impact on the reproductive success of the individuals who display them. As a result, the average (modal) traits of populations change over the course of multiple generations. We can observe this happening in species that have a rapid rate of reproduction. We know what causes new variants to arise, and we know what causes environments to change. It's about as \u201ccontroversial\u201d as the existence of the mailman or Tuesdays.\nCreationists don't so much \u201crefuse to acknowledge the evidence,\u201d but rather, argue against something that only exists in their imagination.\nHope that helps", "Why target creationists? Their job is unrelated to analyzing scientific theories for the most part. Religion helps them to do their jobs, raise a family, and be sociable, and thereby helps them to live more fully. Why would you change that by introducing concepts unrelated to current situations.\nThey are not detectives trying to prove anything, least not their beginnings.\nEvolution itself is clearly lacking as a way to provide for humans. It can\u2019t provide us with methods, tactics, or insight. It can\u2019t teach. It can only negate what has been established and thereby is an obstacle to our learning about love. If a teacher lives on earth and loves us to become better, we can become better in awe of their example. Isn\u2019t that the truest form of learning?\nAlso, creationists haven\u2019t received the full extent of the study of evolution. Blavatsky wrote a seven race theory of evolution in 1888, and there hasn\u2019t been much of an attempt to raise the work done by a female into today\u2019s trend to honor women alongside men. Open up the ranks to people who are not white males and see why competing theories should be presented in our studies.", "The truth is that most influential promoters of Young Earth Creationism such as Ken Ham, the Discovery Institute, the Institute for Creation Research insist that their staff and contributors sign a document in which they agree that wherever the evidence contradicts their interpretation of the Bible it is the evidence that is wrong.\nSo it is a deliberate denial of the evidence, and yet they teach children that their objections to mainstream science are evidence based.", "ALL the evidence is FOR evolution, and the vast majority of the evidence is strong, fascinating, intriguing and so on and so forth. So, creationists simply don\u2019t like the evidence and they\u2019d rather believe in magic.", "The first one. The evidence for evolution is absolutely overwhelming, but they just stick their fingers in their ears and go \u201cLalala, I\u2019m not listening.\u201d", "Creationists these days, if they are smart and particularly well-read, will say that they acknowledge all the evidence; they just interpret it in another way.\nThis could be true, if you squint hard enough. It is, after all, possible to look at the complete boatload of evidence that supports modern evolutionary biology and say that it also supports your god being omnipotent. Well, sure.. absolutely everything could match a particularly devious god who can do anything she wants.\nThe big problem here is that all the evidence is useless in that case. Since it supports anything you want, you might as well not look at it in the first place.\nThese people aren\u2019t doing science. They somehow found out that you can just buy white lab coats and took it from there.

Science needs integrity.", "\u201cDo creationists simply refuse to acknowledge the evidence for evolution or is the evidence of evolution, in reality, severely lacking?\u201d\nCreationism is based exclusively on denying the evidence, combined with refusal to learn what does or does not count as evidence.\nIt\u2019s a very strange stance because if you read the New Testament you will learn that Jesus taught by allegory.

He redefined physics. He challenged every dogma of physics and decimated them. His greatness is immeasurable for us mere mortals. Yet, since you ask, I shall try to explain.\nBrownian Motion: Ludwig Boltzmann thought that atoms existed. But the scientific community did not take him seriously and deepened his depression. Ultimately, the father of Thermodynamics committed suicide. But the idea of atom is as old as the Greeks. It took an Einstein to dust off the observations of a forgotten Botanist, apply his imagination and mathematical acumen to come up with the proof of the existence of atoms. There were many great physicists before Einstein. It did not occur to them to look for clues in insignificant experiments. With one stroke of genius, Einstein ended the millenniums old debate that started with Democritus.\nPhotoelectric effect: It was Newton who proposed that light was made up of corpuscles. Christiaan Huygens, the Dutch physicist showed that light was a wave. Maxwell\u2019s four equations put all the debates to rest and proved mathematically that light was indeed an electromagnetic wave. For everyone else, Maxwell\u2019s equations were enough. Not so for the iconoclast. Einstein showed that light was indeed a particle and that particle even had a wavelength. It took an Einstein to challenge the greatest physicist of 19th century and trump him too.\nSpecial Relativity: There was no lack of great physicists in Europe during the early years of Einstein. But they did not have the courage to go against the status quo. Be he Poincar\u00e9 or Lorentz, it was not possible for them to give up the idea of Aether even when the Michaelson and Morley experiment came back empty-handed. Einstein was a radical. He assumed that the speed of light is constant, irrespective of the frame of reference of the observer. The rest is history. A major spin off of his theory of Special Relativity is the mass-energy equivalence. But that is not all about Special Relativity. With this theory, Einstein successfully challenged our understanding of time and space. It challenged Newton\u2019s notion of universal time.\nGeneral Relativity: As if all these great discoveries were not enough, Einstein embarked upon an adventure to generalize relative motion. It took him 10 years of stubbornness to prove Newton\u2019s physics to be a mere approximation. He did it while not having the expertise required in mathematics. He ran from Grossman to Minkowski to Hilbert to know how he could express his imagination. His imagination was so great, that he did not even have the language to express it. But when eventually he did, he changed our understanding of the universe.\nToday we talk about the big bang, the expanding universe, the black holes, we understand why the earth has seasons, why day and night occurs, how the sun produces so much energy, we can make a tiny bomb that can destroy an entire province, we understand chemistry better, we understand gravity better because of him. Albert Einstein, changed everything in physics. He changed the way we look at the big and the small. He was the founding father of Quantum Mechanics, and he also pioneered Relativity. Be it the laptop or the smartphone or the television, be it the GPS in your car, be it the nuclear reactor providing you with electricity or the polarized sunglasses on your eyes\u2026everything tracks its origins to Albert Einstein in one or the other way. Every modern invention is connected to the discoveries of the great man.\nThere have been great physicists. The difference between the great physicists and the greatest physicist was that even though his contemporaries had a lot more knowledge and expertise in mathematics, they did not have the maestro\u2019s imagination, stubbornness and courage.", "He simply was not. I believe that I have buried his legacy. But whilst also somewhat affecting all other legacies, I still rank Archimedes, Galileo, Newton, Coulomb, Ampere, Maxwell, Lorentz, Schwinger and Feynmann in front of Einstein.\nI would place Newton in 2nd Place as the greatest Classical Physicist.\nThird I would place Feynmann, because, although, his work on the Anomalous Moment is somewhat flawed, without him, I could not never have closed the argument describing Quantum Mechanics in 4D.", "Because he created both halves of modern physics: quantum mechanics and general relativity, not to mention special relativity, and numerous other contributions.

That was a big deal. But was he better than Newton or Maxwell?", "that is a speculative question. I'm a huge Albert Einstein fan.

Its low solubility owes to its inability to oxidize ferrous ions to ferric ions in a hemoglobin molecule unlike oxygen.\nTherefore, almost all the nitrogen is simply exhaled.\nHope this helps:)", "Yes", "We breathe in air , which is a mixture of the components you mentioned , but its the solubility and binding capacity of the gas components with Haemoglobin that determines its importance.\nFor the matter of importance, we know that oxygen drives the ETS system in the mitochondria by removing H+ as water molecules. This removal of H+ from NADH2 , FADH2, gives us the required energy to sustain our lives. So we can see that oxygen is of utmost importance .\nHaemoglobin has higher affinity for oxygen. ( even more for carbondioxide, and more so for carbon monoxide\u2026 ) but very low or no affinity for Nitrogen.\nAlso nitrogen is quiet inert at body temperature , due to high bond dissociation energy (triple bond between two nitrogen atoms) .\nSo for the sake of recognising the importance of oxygen we say that we breathe in oxygen\nHey!

One is the partial pressure of the oxygen and the other is the effect of the other gas we mix it with.\n(Partial pressure is the important term, it is the contribution of a gas to the total pressure that matters) .\nAll gases pass in to your bloodstream, but most of the oxygen under normal circumstances is intercepted in the lungs and bound to hemoglobin blood cells.\nThe role of nitrogen is to reduce the partial pressure of oxygen, too much oxygen will cause tissue damage, called oxygen poisoning. In fact 21% oxygen is more than we need, we can go down to much less, in some computer rooms you can breathe at 15% oxygen but a match will not ignite.\nToo high a partial pressure for the diluting gas can cause narcosis, the companion gas to oxygen can be any gas with low lipid solubility. Too high a partial pressure of the companion gas and it will clog up cell membranes causing life threatening narcosis. Alternatives to nitrogen are helium, argon, and even hydrogen for deep sea diving.\nNot to be confused with decompression sickness, that is when bubbles of nitrogen form, caused by breathing higher than normal nitrogen partial pressure. That in turn is because the oxygen ratio is lowered to 10% by increasing the companion gas, to compensate for the pressure increase when diving.\nSome reasonably common gases are entirely unsuitable to breathe of course. Carbon monoxide gas is poisonous not so much because if it's effect in tissues, but because it competes with oxygen for hemoglobin sites, and forms a stable carboxyheamoglobin complex.

Plants can't utilize this atmospheric nitrogen unless it is converted into nitrates with the help of microorganisms. So when we breath,along with oxygen nitrogen also enter in our body but because body is not able to absorb this gaseous nitrogen so it immediately leave the body along with CO2. So we can say during inhalation O2 enter in the body along with other gases e.g N2 and CO2 along with other gases e.g N2 leave body during Exhalation.

They\u2019re all mixed & all make their way down to the alveoli of the lungs to be available for gas exchange.\nIt\u2019s notable, however, that oxygen gas O2 is absorbed by the body for the purpose of cellular respiration, not to return to the atmosphere, while a roughly equal volume of carbon dioxide CO2 is generated to take the absorbed oxygen\u2019s place in exhaled gas.\nThus 21% O2 enters the alveoli of the lungs, but typically only 15\u201318% O2 is exhaled, the difference being what the body takes for its metabolic needs. We \u201cbreathe in\u201d oxygen because, like all animals, we require oxygen gas to stay alive.

Nitrogen gas dissolved in your blood and tissues has long ago reached equilibrium with the partial pressure of atmospheric nitrogen. We all carry nitrogen gas dissolved in our bodies!\nBecause of this equilibrium, N2 just sloshes in and out of the lungs every time you breathe, but is neither produced by metabolism (like CO2) nor absorbed by diffusion into blood (like O2). You exhale exactly as much N2 as you inhale\u2014its partial pressure remains constant throughout the respiratory cycle.

Our metabolism derives chemical energy from the breakdown of complex carbon molecules; this doesn't happen on its own and you need very reactive molecules to interact with those complex carbon molecules and break them down. All organisms do this step-by-step, using successive \"electron acceptors\" to basically strip electrons off of simpler-and-simpler molecules and thus break them down. Molecular oxygen is the most reactive molecule and greedy electron acceptor out there, and allows organisms that use it to get the most energy possible out of a given carbohydrate. That's why aerobic respiration is so useful, and that's what we use oxygen for. Molecular nitrogen has completely different chemical properties; it isn't that electronegative (i.e. greedy for electrons) at all. There are other molecules that can be used as electron acceptors, and are used in various forms of anaerobic respiration: nitrate, sulfate, carbon dioxide... but molecular nitrogen isn't one of them.\nFor various kinds of anaerobic respiration, see : Microbial metabolism - Wikipedia\nThere is a purpose for which one could use molecular nitrogen, which is to use it to build nitrogen-based molecules that our body depends on - like DNA, RNA and proteins, which basically do everything in a living organism. No organism uses molecular nitrogen as a source for these; it's much easier to use organic nitrogen compounds like nitrates and ammonia. It can seem silly that such compounds are so limiting, when nitrogen makes up most of the atmosphere! This is less of an issue for carnivores since we get all of our nitrogen needs from eating nitrogen-filled animals, but it's a huge issue for plants. The need for such compounds (and, to a lesser extent, phosphates) is why agriculture needs fertilizer. So why can very very few organisms break down molecular nitrogen ? Because it is a very stable molecule; if you've done chemistry you might know that the two nitrogen atoms in the nitrogen molecule are connected by a triple bond, which is very strong and hard to break. This may be a big reason why the metabolism to break that bond evolved only in bacteria, and all Eukaryotes get by using the bacteria themselves (nitrogen-fixing plants), absorbing nitrogen-filled organisms (carnivores, carnivorous plants - it's the reason they're carnivorous!) or getting by on the organic nitrogen that naturally occurs in the ground thanks to nitrogen-fixing bacteria.\nNitrogen fixation - Wikipedia\nAs an aside, the fertilizer humans make uses the Haber process, which converts molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere to ammonia. If you look at the Wikipedia page by the way you'll get an idea of how hard it is to break that triple bond, between the catalysts and the high temperatures and pressures... But through that process you could argue that humanity as a species does \"breathe\" nitrogen.\nHaber process - Wikipedia\nSo basically,\nwe don't need to breathe nitrogen\nif we did our bodies still wouldn't because it's really hard to do; no eukaryote does it, except maybe humans themselves but only through technology.", "The %nitrogen inhalation is equal to@%nitrogen exhalation therefore no nitrogen used in the body", "We do breathe in whatever is in the air - mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, argon and whatever else is in the area. Why did you think that we could separate out the nitrogen (and the rest)?", "As far as my understanding goes, we humans do inhale nitrogen along with oxygen. But, we cannot directly assimilate the atmospheric nitrogen into our body, like plants, and so we exhale it out.\nOne of the reasons behind this is that humans don\u2019t have any nitrogen binder in the body, like it has for oxygen (i.e. hemoglobin). Another reason is that nitrogen is not as reactive as oxygen, hence the body doesn\u2019t need it.\nHowever, some microorganisms, like the bacteria \u2018Rhizobium\u2019 do have particular enzymes which can fix the atmospheric nitrogen and provide it to the plants in a usable form. But since we don\u2019t have the enzymes to break the strong triple bond of nitrogen we cannot directly assimilate nitrogen from air but rather take it in some other forms.\nTherefore, even though there is high percentage of nitrogen in atmosphere, we don\u2019t directly breathe in nitrogen.", "If we keep full bag of leave and one 500 note surely people will take 500 note and ignore leaves.\nSo the logic says we take only wanted things not unwanted things and oxygen is what we needed.\nSorry my answer is not related to chemistry.", "wow really interesting question we breathe in air nd in our atmosphere many gaseous are present including nitrogen and oxygen In large amount the amount of nitrogen is more in our environment then oxygen..... bt our body need oxygen in large amount so we inhale oxygen and exhale nitrogen as a waste material\u2026.nd if anyhow we start Inhaling nitrogen then it may cause some harmful disease...

About 300 ml.of it is transferred from alveoli to the blood each minute, even when the person is at rest. At the same time an equal amount of Carbon dioxide gas moves from the blood to alveoli and is exhaled.

A small fraction of the N2 gas dissolve in our blood, but the same amount of N2 evaporates since there is equilibrium.\nWhen divers breath compressed air, they get the same ratio of 78% of nitrogen gas. However, the air pressure is much higher. The extra pressure comes from the mass of all the water between the diver and the surface. A larger proportion of N2 dissolves in the blood.

Otherwise, the extra liquid N2 in the blood would evaporate all over the body creating gas bubbles that obstruct the capillaries.\nFor the brain, it is like thousands of micro strokes starving neurons and astrocytes.\nSo, for x minutes of deep diving, the decompression time is also x minutes. The slow decrease of pressure allow to exhale those N2 gas molecules thru the lungs.\nThe sperm whales don't need decompression because they dive with empty lungs, they stop breathing for 20 minutes.

The energy imparted by the pump to lift the water is akin to EMF.", "There is an excellent discussion of emf at this location: 10.2: Electromotive Force\nI will summarize it, but I suggest reading the article. Very informative.\nVoltage sources such as batteries, generators, and solar panels provide the \u201cpush\u201d that sends charge on its way through a circuit. That \u201cpush\u201d raises the energy level of the charge, and electromotive force is a measure of how much energy is given to a unit of charge by the voltage source. The emf is, actually a measure of energy per unit charge rather than a measure of force. The unit of emf is the same as the unit of potential difference, namely volts.\nIn an ideal world, The voltage measured at the terminals of a voltage source would be equal to the emf of that voltage source. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t live in an ideal world, so some of the energy given to charge as it is \u201cpumped\u201d by the source is dissipated as the charge is moving internally from one terminal of the source to the other. We speak of the internal resistance of a voltage source, and we represent a voltage source as an ideal voltage source (no internal resistance) in series with a resistor representing the voltage source\u2019s internal resistance.\nIf you measure the output voltage of a real voltage source, that is the difference in voltage between its terminals, when there is no load (no current being drawn), and your voltmeter draws virtually no current, then the potential difference between the terminals, will equal the emf of the voltage source. If you draw current from the battery, then there will be a voltage drop across the internal resistance of the battery, and the output voltage will be less than the emf.\nSo, to make a long story short, emf is the energy per unit charge that a voltage source would be capable of providing if there were no internal losses due to current flow. The voltage measured at the source\u2019s output terminals is the energy per unit charge of the charge carriers as they exit the source.\nSo, I don\u2019t think that there is an analogy with potential and kinetic energy.", "In physical chemistry, there is a concept of \u201cgeneralized work\u201d which can create potential energy.

The element of work done on the cell (creating potential energy) is E dQ.\nSource: Moore\u2019s Physical Chemistry, 3rd Edition, p 33\u20134", "No. Voltage and EMF are closer to being the same thing that potential and kinetic energy are. I\u2019m not 100% sure what the precise technical definitions are - I see them used almost interchangeably. Sometimes I feel like EMF is more likely to be used for potential differences created by rotating / changing magnetic fields in a motor or generator, whereas voltage is used for almost any potential difference (battery, power supply, etc.)\nAt any rate, they\u2019re both measured in volts and both cause the same sort of effects in a circuit.

But its so small that it practically means nothing. A better term for it is that these astronauts experience \u201ctime dilation\u201d; they experience time slower than the rest of us sitting on Earth.\nIt might help to explain this using a bit of math. Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity predicted this phenomenon where the faster you go, the slower time will pass for you. Here is the equation:\nis the time you experience while travelling at high speed, is the time people who aren\u2019t moving experience, v is the speed in which you travel, and c is the speed of light (a constant). Plug this into your calculator, and you\u2019ll find that time passes slower when you\u2019re going faster. And you\u2019ll also notice that the difference between the time experiences isn\u2019t very significant until you\u2019re approaching a fraction of the speed of light. So for an astronaut in orbit, travelling at thousands of mph, they get to experience this time dilation even if its immeasurably small.\nEven on Earth, we\u2019re also experiencing some gravitational time dilation due to, well, gravity. The closer we are to the source of the gravity (i.e. center of the Earth, for simplification), the slower time passes compared to someone floating freely in space far from any planets or stars.\nYou probably notice that this means that time passes faster for our orbiting astronauts compared to us on the ground, and you\u2019re absolutely right. But the thing is, the \u201cgain\u201d they got from travelling at orbital speeds is greater than the \u201closs\u201d due to being further away from Earth. So all in all, they do travel to the future, just a bit. Here\u2019s a neat chart to show how this works out:\nOur astronauts in the ISS \u201cgained\u201d about 25 microseconds every day they stay up there, so that translates to about 45 miliseconds in a 6-month mission. Not much. What\u2019s interesting is that GPS satellites are far enough from Earth that their \u201closs\u201d is greater than their \u201cgain\u201d, and so they have to correct this in order to give us good measurement on our position in our phones.\nSo in pop culture, this has been explained pretty well in Interstellar. Absolutely beautiful movie and was done with scientific accuracy in mind (the engineering side is a bit dismal, but that\u2019s another story).\nTravelling back in time though is probably impossible. The physics (and math, or even the philosophy) behind it is far from definite. It\u2019s called the Grandfather Paradox and this was the plot of Back to the Future: What happens if you do manage to go back in time and remove one of your ancestors? In that case, you wouldn\u2019t be born in the first place and you won\u2019t be able to grow up, travel back in time, and kill your ancestor?\nThere are a few explanations out there, like how if you were to do that then you\u2019ll be transported to another universe (basically another timeline) and you can\u2019t go back to the original timeline.

This heat travels up into the atmosphere and into space, but some interacts with the molecules in the air and is trapped within the system. This is the core of how global warming works, CO2 is a much more effective molecule at absorbing infra-red energy than nitrogen or oxygen is, and as such acts as an insulating blanket against heat loss back into space.\nThere are ideas of increasing the aerosol content of the upper atmosphere in order to increase the reflectivity of our atmosphere. This reduces the amount of radiant energy reaching the ground, and hence the temperatures.

Is it through travel? Or where did it originate from? What happened to it?\u201d\nFirst of all atoms do not become radioactive, they\u2019re either radioactive when they\u2019re created or they\u2019re not.\nA radioactive atom is just an atom with an unstable nucleus, causing the nucleus to decay \u201cdecay\u201d. There are three types of nuclear decay:\nAlpha decay is when heavy elements break down (converting them into lighter elements) because they have too many protons. They do this by emitting an alpha particle composed of 2 protons and 2 neutrons (the same as the nucleus of a helium atom). This is what causes the naturally occurring elements to stop at 92 protons (uranium), heavier elements can be created but they\u2019re too unstable to stay around for a long time.\nBeta decay occurs when a particular isotope (type) of an element has the wrong number of neutrons to be stable. For example most carbon atoms are carbon-12, which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons and is stable, however, some carbon atoms are carbon-14, which has 6 protons and 8 neutrons and is radioactive. Beta decay involves either a proton converting to a neutron or a neutron converting to a proton. This changes the atom into an atom of another element (because the number of protons has changed) and often involves the nucleus emitting a beta particle (an electron or positron). Also, if you want the complete picture, a neutrino or antineutrino is also emitted.\nGamma decay occurs when an atom has too much energy in its nucleus. The nucleus loses this energy by emitting gamma rays, which are just very short wavelength light. Gamma decay, unlike alpha and beta decay, does not convert the atom into an atom of a different element. Also gamma decay rarely happens on its own (technetium-99m being a notable exception) but often happens along with alpha or beta decay.\nSo WHY does all this happen?\nAnswering that question involves some deep physics, and I strongly recommend that anyone interested in truly understanding atoms tries to wrap their head around it. I go through it in a fair bit of detail here Samuel Green's answer to Why do some elements decay and others don't?

This is a great advantage as the various atmosphere layers induce distortions in the path of light coming from extraterrestrial sources, and this greatly affects the quality of astronomical images.\nTo overcome this problem, other than going outside the atmosphere, there are now telescopes using active and adaptive optics that are able to correct in a very good way for this effect.\nNow, having said that, HST can see light from very distant sources, just because they are intrinsically very bright or because, in order to take an image of such sources, a huge amount of integration time was spend. This is the equivalent of taking a picture with a normal reflex camera, and letting the shutter open for a long time. Like this more light can be collect, and very distant, very faint sources can be detected. For example, the deepest image obtained with HST, the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF), combined the equivalent of 21.7 days (DAYS, not seconds, not hours) of exposure.\nBut the ability of detecting distant, faint sources, is not the only thing that matters in a telescope. Another important characteristics is the resolving power, that is the minimum (angular) distance at which two sources need to be located, so that the telescope can perceive them as two really different sources. If they are too close, the telescope will only see one source. This resolving power depends on 2 things: on the wavelength (the \u201ccolor of the light\u201d, if you will) at which your telescope is taking the image, and the diameter of the telescope itself. The larger is the telescope primarily mirror, the better the resolving power (or angular resolution) will be. The larger the wavelength, the worse the angular resolution. This is why the image of the black hole in the galaxy M87, taken few months ago, was so detailed, in terms of angular resolution: because, despite begin taken at a very long wavelengths (in the millimetric radio domain) the virtual diameter of the telescope that have been used was thousands of km. This is a special technique that is called interferometry, where various telescopes located in different parts of the planet are used simultaneously to look at the same objects. In this case, it is as if a unique giant telescope, whose diameter si equal to the distance between the two farthest telescopes, was assembled. HST would have never achieved this, exactly because of the small diameter of its mirror.\nThis, among other things, is why the HST cannot be used to view atomic particles (or, as many have asked, the USA flag on the moon).", "Your question was almost perfect, till you used the word forward.\nSee, it might look like you magically go forward when you look through a telescope or binocular. But you and I both know your body is still at the same spot.\nSo what happens is that light travels uninterrupted for millions of years And then one final second it slams into the back of your eye where it upsets some electrons that directly go to your brain to complain about the disturbance. And that is the sad end of the photon. And the begin of your brain registering a color.\nNow imagine the pure frustration of another photon. Travelled the same distance. Avoided stellar dust, planets, clouds and it just hits useless in your iris. Darn. Or hits your forehead. Or just the street around you.\nAnd that is where telescopes come in.

The heart's electrical system also increases this rate to meet your body's needs during physical activity and lowers it during sleep.\nAn orderly contraction of your atria and ventricles (this is called a sinus rhythm).\nSee a picture of the heart and its electrical system\n.\nHow does the heart's electrical system work?\nYour heart muscle is made of tiny cells. Your heart's electrical system controls the timing of your heartbeat by sending an electrical signal through these cells.\nTwo different types of cells in your heart enable the electrical signal to control your heartbeat:\nConducting cells carry your heart's electrical signal.\nMuscle cells enable your heart's chambers to contract, an action triggered by your heart's electrical signal.\nThe electrical signal travels through the network of conducting cell \"pathways,\" which stimulates your upper chambers (atria) and lower chambers (ventricles) to contract. The signal is able to travel along these pathways by means of a complex reaction that allows each cell to activate one next to it, stimulating it to \"pass along\" the electrical signal in an orderly manner. As cell after cell rapidly transmits the electrical charge, the entire heart contracts in one coordinated motion, creating a heartbeat.\nThe electrical signal starts in a group of cells at the top of your heart called the sinoatrial (SA) node. The signal then travels down through your heart, triggering first your two atria and then your two ventricles. In a healthy heart, the signal travels very quickly through the heart, allowing the chambers to contract in a smooth, orderly fashion.\nThe heartbeat happens as follows:\nThe SA node (called the pacemaker of the heart) sends out an electrical impulse.\nThe upper heart chambers (atria) contract.\nThe AV node sends an impulse into the ventricles.\nThe lower heart chambers (ventricles) contract or pump.\nThe SA node sends another signal to the atria to contract, which starts the cycle over again.\nThis cycle of an electrical signal followed by a contraction is one heartbeat.\nSA node and atria\nWhen the SA node sends an electrical impulse, it triggers the following process:\nThe electrical signal travels from your SA node through muscle cells in your right and left atria.\nThe signal triggers the muscle cells that make your atria contract.\nThe atria contract, pumping blood into your left and right ventricles.\nAV node and ventricles\nAfter the electrical signal has caused your atria to contract and pump blood into your ventricles, the electrical signal arrives at a group of cells at the bottom of the right atrium called the atrioventricular node, or AV node. The AV node briefly slows down the electrical signal, giving the ventricles time to receive the blood from the atria. The electrical signal then moves on to trigger your ventricles.\nWhen the electrical signal leaves the AV node, it triggers the following process:\nThe signal travels down a bundle of conduction cells called the bundle of His, which divides the signal into two branches: one branch goes to the left ventricle, another to the right ventricle.\nThese two main branches divide further into a system of conducting fibers that spreads the signal through your left and right ventricles, causing the ventricles to contract.\nWhen the ventricles contract, your right ventricle pumps blood to your lungs and the left ventricle pumps blood to the rest of your body.\nAfter your atria and ventricles contract, each part of the system electrically resets itself.\nHow does the heart's electrical system regulate your heart rate?\nThe cells of the SA node at the top of the heart are known as the pacemaker of the heart because the rate at which these cells send out electrical signals determines the rate at which the entire heart beats (heart rate).\nThe normal heart rate at rest ranges between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Your heart rate can adjust higher or lower to meet your body's needs.\nWhat makes your heart rate speed up or slow down?\nYour brain and other parts of your body send signals to stimulate your heart to beat either at a faster or a slower rate. Although the way all of the chemical signals interact to affect your heart rate is complex, the net result is that these signals tell the SA node to fire charges at either a faster or slower pace, resulting in a faster or a slower heart rate.\nFor example, during periods of exercise, when the body requires more oxygen to function, signals from your body cause your heart rate to increase significantly to deliver more blood (and therefore more oxygen) to the body. Your heart rate can increase beyond 100 beats per minute to meet your body's increased needs during physical exertion.\nSimilarly, during periods of rest or sleep, when the body needs less oxygen, the heart rate decreases. Some athletes actually may have normal heart rates well below 60 because their hearts are very efficient and don't need to beat as fast. Changes in your heart rate, therefore, are a normal part of your heart's effort to meet the needs of your body.\nHow does your body control your heart rate?\nYour body controls your heart by:\nThe sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, which have nerve endings in the heart.\nHormones, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine (catecholamines), which circulate in the bloodstream.\nSympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems\nThe sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are opposing forces that affect your heart rate. Both systems are made up of very tiny nerves that travel from the brain or spinal cord to your heart. The sympathetic nervous system is triggered during stress or a need for increased cardiac output and sends signals to your heart to increase its rate. The parasympathetic system is active during periods of rest and sends signals to your heart to decrease its rate.\nCatecholamines\nDuring stress or a need for increased cardiac output, the adrenal glands release a hormone called norepinephrine into the bloodstream at the same time that the sympathetic nervous system is also triggered to increase your heart rate. This hormone causes the heart to beat faster, and unlike the sympathetic nervous system that sends an instantaneous and short-lived signal, norepinephrine released into the bloodstream increases the heart rate for several minutes or more."], "date_list": ["Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Matt Gailliot", "view_list": [65, 1200]}, "180": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["Vishnuthirtha Madaksira", "Achkal Aslam Ayyub"], "question_title": "When pH is calculated from Ka value of a weak acid, is the [H+] ions from dissociation of solvent water included?", "topic_list": ["Acid-Base Chemistry", "Solvents", "Ions", "pH (chemistry)", "Acids", "Water", "Science", "Chemistry"], "no_of_view": "691", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "ans_list": ["pH = 1/2pKa- 1/2logC\n[H+] =C.alpha", "From first calculate concentration, then calculate H ion conc , then calculate pH\nKa=alpha square x C\nH ion conc= n x alpha x C\nPH = - log H ion conc"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Anosh Kurian", "view_list": [153, 468]}, "467": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What does a luminous stone do?", "topic_list": ["Luminous", "Mineralogy", "Crystals", "Rocks and Stones", "Gemstones", "Jewelry", "Science", "Physics"], "no_of_view": "203", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Cozma Dan Claudiu", "view_list": []}, "300": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What are the most interesting experiments done in chimera?", "topic_list": ["Chimeras (genetics)", "Science Experiments", "Experiments", "Molecular Biology", "Scientific Research", "Genetics and Heredity", "Biology", "Science"], "no_of_view": "231", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Sweety Singal", "view_list": []}, "210": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Aman Yadav"], "question_title": "What were Galileo\u2019s contributions to science and mathematics?", "topic_list": ["Galileo Galilei", "Science and Mathematics", "History of Mathematics", "Contributions", "History of Science", "Science of Everyday Life", "Science", "Mathematics", "History", "Physics"], "no_of_view": "362", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [1], "ans_list": ["Galileo Galilei\n1564 - 1642\nGalileo was born in 1564, the year of Michelangelo's death and Shakespeare's birth. Because of this fact, some say that Galileo was destined to do great things. Galileo's father, Vincenzio Galilei was a musical theorist, who supported his family by selling cloth. Galileo's father, wanting him to prosper more so than himself, strongly encouraged him to attend the University of Pisa to study medicine.\nWhile studying at the university, bored of medicine, he discovered something that fascinated him. Walking through the halls, he glanced in at a class so entranced with the lecturer that he was impelled to listen and watch. As he listened to the geometry lesson, Galileo realized what he really wanted to study. He kept studying medicine at the persistence of his father, but while still in his first year, convinced his father to allow him to study math with a private tutor. Eventually, he quit studying medicine to focus his interests in math. In his time, the study of math, astronomy and science were very closely related. These studies led him to many profound discoveries.\nIn 1582, while praying in a chapel, Galileo observed a lamplighter lighting the chandeliers. The lamplighter would pull the lamps nearer him with a rod, and after lighting them, let them swing until they hung in place. Timing the swings against his own heartbeat, Galileo discovered the law of pendulum. No matter how wide an arc the lamps made, the time it took to complete a cycle, swinging from one side to the other was the same, even as the size of the arc decreased.\nIn 1589, at age 25, Galileo was given the position of lecturer in math at the University and was selected as the Chair of Mathematics. During this time, he began to study the works of Aristotle. Challenging some of the ideas of the great scientist, Galileo began to experiment on his own. Many of his colleagues thought him mad and ignored his studies. Wanting to disprove Aristotle's theory of falling objects, Galileo devised an experiment. In order to gain the respect of his colleagues, he heavily advertised the upcoming experiment. With the aid of two of his students, Galileo took two metal balls, one of which weighed ten times as much as the other. Dropping them from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, his students timed each of the balls' falls. When Galileo's theory was proven correct, that no matter the weight, the balls would fall at the same rate and land at the same time, his colleagues still did not believe him, accusing him of using magic to alter the falls.\nA better position was available, and in 1592, he left Pisa and became professor of mathematics at the University of Padau near Venice. There, he remained until 1600 when, at age 45, he was asked by Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosmo II to be the Chief Mathematician in his court in Florence.\nIn 1609, Galileo revised the spyglass to create a telescope, improving magnification from 9 times to 32. With this new creation, Galileo began his study of the ever-mysterious heavens. He discovered many things with his telescope, such as mountains on the moon, and moons around Jupiter. In 1610, Galileo's first scientific book The Starry Messenger was published, describing what he had seen. With his new findings, Galileo also began to compare the theories of Ptolemy (which stated that all planets, including the sun orbited the Earth) and Copernicus (which stated that the sun was the center of the universe). Galileo's findings supported Copernicus' theory, which was against the beliefs of the church. In 1616, Galileo was called to the Roman Inquisition and made to promise to no longer publish or defend the Copernican theory.\nAfter two more calls to the Roman Inquisition, Galileo was convicted of heresy and incarcerated. Shortly after his incarceration, his sentence was lessened to house arrest. For the last 8 years of his life, Galileo lived in his estate at Arcetri. Still studying mathematics, and with the aid of several faithful students, he wrote more on his studies of motion. Forbidden to publish, at least one known book(Discourses on Two New Sciences) was smuggled from the country to be published elsewhere. In 1642, at age 78, having led a full life of discovery, Galileo died, apparently of natural causes.\nSource: Galileo"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Rajan Kumar", "view_list": [132]}, "3": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "How did lock down affect the ozone layer?

The first I call cosmic time. Now, in cosmic time, we take the Earth's rotation on its axis and call it a day. This day can be divided into 24 hours. Each hour is divided into 60 minutes and each minute is divided into 60 seconds. Gravity doesn't alter this type of time.\nThe second type of time, I call atomic time. Now, atomic time uses a bottom up approach. It uses the decay rate of atoms to define a second. Think carbon/plutonium decay. 60 seconds makes a minute. 60 minutes make an hour and 24 hours make 1 day. Gravity does alter the decay rate of atoms and subsequently, it alters atomic time.\nNow, here's where it gets complicated.\nLife is nothing but a conglomeration of atomic processes, which means that we age according to atomic time, not cosmic time. So, gravity affects the rate at which we age. But wait\u2026. There's more.\nYou see, consciousness is also an atomic processes and our perception of time passing is determined by these atomic processes. Simply put, when our atomic clocks slow down, so does our biological clock. So, we never perceive our atomic clock slowing down. From our perspective, it's the cosmic clock which changes. So, as gravity gets weaker, our atomic clocks run faster and from our perspective, the earth rotates slower on its axis.\nHere's a graphic representation of this phenomenon.\nBoth observers believe that their time is correct and technically, they are correct. Their clock indicates the rate at which they are aging.", "Gravity does actually slow time relative to an outside observer.", "Gravity is slowing down the time we observe in a gravitational field. It does this by a phenomenon similar to the slowing clock in a moving frame.", "If you perceive gravity as a source of time, not as an affect on time, it makes the explanation pretty simple.\nAny mass creates gravity. The larger the mass, the greater the gravity. As you move away from the source of gravity, the strength of gravity lessens.\nIt is your gravity, combined with your environment\u2019s gravity that determines the total affect of gravity, from your perspective.\nIn my opinion, time works exactly the same way. If you look as time as something emanating from any mass, and affected by other sources of mass, just makes sense to me.\nWe all experience time one second at a time. That experience is unique to each of us. It is similar because of the much larger source of gravity-time we all live on.\nEarth is a source of gravity-time. You are a source of gravity-time. Black holes are a source of gravity-time.\nWhile you will always see one second at a time, what you see in that second all depends on what other influence or lack of influence of gravity-time there is around you.\nThe more gravity, the slower the time emanating.

The greater the displacement of the supersolid vacuum by a planet, the greater the displaced supersolid vacuum pushes back and exerts pressure toward and throughout an atomic clock on the surface of the planet, the slower the clock ticks.\nThe faster an atomic clock moves with respect to the state of the supersolid vacuum in which it exists, the greater the displacement of the supersolid vacuum by the clock, the greater the pressure exerted toward and through the atomic clock as the supersolid vacuum \u2018displaces back\u2019, the slower the clock ticks.", "The stronger the gravitational force the slower everything is.

That\u2019s all that\u2019s happening. Time is not slowed by gravity, but clocks are.

Suppose you want to know how torture affects the human mind.

The point is that because you cannot experiment of groups of humans in the same way that you can experiment on a box of nails, obtaining rigorous results is much more difficult.

You my friend, have the makings of a philosopher in you.\nLet us use logic, in honor of Aristotle.\nFirst off, this is not a theological debate. Whether you believe in the big bang or the big man in the sky is up to you.\nI will also clarify that we can never be truly sure of anything. However this mindset is counterproductive to science, and therefore we use Plato\u2019s ideals to study the world.\nThe only real foundation we have is the law of noncontradiction states that something cannot be true and false at the same time. (Although with quantum theory ANYTHING becomes possible: unscrambling eggs, having your cake and eating it too, etc.)\nSo let us extend that. Let us say that every effect must have a cause. A cause must be something that produces an effect, and an effect must have a cause. An uncaused effect is simply irrational.\nHaving said this, an explanation like the big bang makes no sense. From whence did this little sphere emerge?\nThe only explanation for the big bang is if the big bang is in itself an uncaused, of self-existent, thing. Essentially, for all intents in purposes, the big bang had always existed. This actually harkens back fi many ancient folklores, where a supreme god dies and out its corpse the universe emerges. Same principle.\nAll that having been said, there is one reason that we know the universe has always been around. This is because of the tricky little devil known as entropy. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. However entropy is energy that has been rendered inert. The amount of entropy in the universe either increases or remains the same. Eventually, our universe, after all the stars die and the uncountable years of life end in nothing, will be nothing left but entropy. That, my burgeoning philosopher, is why the universe had to have had a beginning", "That was actually the subject of Stephen Hawking\u2019s graduate thesis.\nBut well before that, the data showed that the temperature of the universe is remarkably consistent no matter which direction you look. That\u2019s called the \u201cmicrowave background radiation\u201d and it has a temperature of about 3 degrees Celsius above absolute zero. Because it\u2019s so consistent, the only conclusion is that at some point every point in the universe, no matter how far away it is from us now, must have been at the exact same point in space about 13 billion years ago.\nWhat\u2019s really weird is that although we aren\u2019t at the \u201ccenter of the universe\u201d in any meaningful sense, it looks like we are. However, it can be worked out that it looks the same way from any other point in the universe. Again, the only explanation - every point in the current universe used to be in the same place.\nHawking\u2019s work proved that this single point was a singularity. General relativity forces a universe that small and dense to be a singularity rather than any other structure.\nSince that time, we\u2019ve discovered minor variations in the background radiation that indicate that very early on - in the first few seconds of the universe\u2019s life, some parts of it expanded faster than other parts. In other words, it looks like we\u2019re in the center because we can only see as far as light has traveled. We just can\u2019t see anything beyond that, but it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s something beyond what we can see. The \u201cobservable universe\u201d we can see with our instruments is only part of the \u201cuniverse\u201d maybe only 10%\nIt also appears that the rate of universe expansion is actually getting faster. That\u2019s because space can expand faster than the speed of light. That\u2019s why science has postulated \u201cdark energy\u201d, which drives this expansion.", "It is your choice what you want to believe.

When you start to question the theory, they will tell you it is the best that their great minds can come up with. You may even be called names for questioning the theory.\nTo understand and perceive information about the universe depends on whether it is your career and you get paid to believe in a certain way or if you are free to think for yourself.\nThe way to be sure of what is true, is to develop self-respect and unconditional love.

Even more specifically, the rate at which the heat is exchanged\u2014and in terms of \u201cfeeling cold\u201d, it means that heat passes from the skin to the air. Now, how does that happen?\nThe molecules of air get in contact with the molecules of, well, us. Our molecules have more heat\u2014that means they vibrate more than the molecules of the air. When they meet, they pass some of that mechanical energy to the molecules of the air\u2014making them vibrate a bit more and themselves a bit less. The rate of that energy transfer then depends on how often these molecules meet\u2014in less dense air, that transfer will be slower. In vacuum, there will be none. Indeed, water can cool you down faster\u2014it\u2019s much denser and therefore a much better heat conductor than the air.\nNow, as you probably know, the density of air (number of molecules per unit of volume) changes with weather. Also, the composition of air changes with weather\u2014namely the content of water (vapour). It so happens that more dense, humid air may feel more cold because of exactly that\u2014there are more molecules to take part in that heat transfer. That\u2019s why we feel \u201cmore cold\u201d in foggy, drizzling and so on autumn day than we sometimes do on a crisp clear winter day, despite the temperature is actually lower on the latter\u2026\nSee?\nOK, so how about the can of \u201csoda\u201d (I believe that\u2019s the American term)? Well, soda doesn\u2019t feel cold. It just stays there, slowly passing the excess of its heat to the air\u2014until they match. The rate of the energy transfer may be slower or faster\u2014it\u2019ll get cool slowly or fast\u2014but the result will be just the same, eventually.\nHere, I come to the inherent flaw in your question: you\u2019re saying \u201ccan it make a canned drink colder faster than its actual temperature?\u201d So first, I hope you can see now that there can indeed be (and is) difference in how fast the drink will cool down.

Dick Smith and Australian philanthropist also with James Randi conducted studies under controlled conditions. Without exception, all who claimed to have psychic abilities or who claimed to be mediums failed and or were debunked.\nThere is no empirical evidence that the dead can talk to us. Those who claim they can have an accuracy rate of between 9 and 11%.\nTwo methods commonly used both in mediumship and those claiming psychic abilities all have accomplices planted in the audience that uses a very simple technique called after black where colour is used as a signal to identify an object chosen by the audience that without assistance could not be identified by the performer.\nMediums use two technics called cold and hot reading. Hot reading is achieved by the mediums accomplices obtaining information from audience participants who then record that information and pass it on to the performer to obtain a higher than normal accuracy. Or electronic devices are used to pass the information on to the performer.\nCold reading is achieved by asking open questions to audience members which are entirely a hit and miss process. The first part of this trick is to make statements such as, \u201cI am getting a message from a man who is old with white hair wearing glasses who died of illness I think it was a heart condition. His name I think is George, Joe, John, Jerry\u2026 It starts with a J.\nOut of an audience of 400\u2013500 people or even an audience of 50\u2013100 the probability is very high that someone had a loved one who died of a heart condition old people generally die at some point and most older people\u2019s eyesight begins to fail and need corrective lenses.\nGenerally, people who attend these meeting are vulnerable and seeking closure or want grief resolved with the assurance that their dead loved ones are in a better place. So-called mediums use this as a hook because once they obtain a recipient they then ask I whole raft of questions and say there are other loved ones such as a woman or a younger child with the passed loved one.\nAll of this is pure guesswork. We think that when we see Edward or Van Prague or another famous medium in TV that they are extraordinary but fail to realize that these shows are heavily edited often live audiences witness up to three or four hours of these presentations while those watching a recorded show see about 1 hour that edits out all the mistakes and failures the medium has made.\nI liken mediums to the Nigerian Prince email scam. Everyone wants assurance and everyone wants an easier life where there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. These scams have been going on for hundreds of years. Fortune tellers, mind reading and all these tricks are well-known practices used by magicians. There is no magic and no psychic ability it is a trick.\nWhen done as harmless entertainment there are no victims. When used to exploit vulnerable people who are grieving it is entirely another matter, it is unethical and immoral.\nMediums claim they use their gifts to give participants closure and resolution however the audiences pay sometimes hundreds of dollars for a private consultation. The point is that the practice is exploitative and fraudulent. The medium is basically making stuff up and lying they have no evidence nor can they prove they are consulting with the dead.

So u get ur answer, spirits& mediums cannot be proven! Simple aint it!", "From my perspective you ask a very valid question.\nI once thought science was a valid discipline for explaining the purpose of phenomena and how it works. It seems that science observes phenomena from observation, experiment and measurements and then forms theories and facts from the information. It has no idea about purpose or the actual workings, apart from the mechanical technologies that have been created over the last 120 years. Most if not all, that work very inefficiently and are harmful to the environment or humanity.\nIn 1901 a decision was made by some very wealthy and influential people for science to follow a mechanical path of atoms and to deny the intelligently designed systems of love and light that drive the universe. As such, spirits, consciousness, unconditional love, intelligent energy and a galaxy that is teaming with life has never been researched at the mainstream level. Their have been individuals like Dewey B Larson, Fred Boyle and Don Elkins who have opened their scientific minds and received very valid information. Micha\u00ebl Faraday, John Dalton and Nikola Tesla also gained insights into reality that was always left field of the arrogance of the intellectuals of the day.\nThe current state of affairs shows how the intellectuals of the world guide the people like sheep. We are in a world of atheists that can only believe what they are told is true by the media, the medical profession and the government. They do not have faith in their own selves because they believe there is only a mechanical world of cause and effect. Without the courage and creativity of their own unique consciousness they are lost to the lies of the doctors and scientists who only tell half the story.\nWe are all in the process of awakening to the truth of intelligent design and a universe of feeling-tones of kindness and intelligent energy. The power of compassion and faith in ourselves far exceeds the power of microwave radiation and man made virus that is going to be enhanced by a man made vaccine. This is where the science that let go of a universe of love and light has brought us to.", "I appreciate the opportunity to address this question. It gets to the heart of so many issues about the teachings of the Bible, about the Christian faith.\nTo start with the question presented here, the answer is simply that spirits are beyond the reach of science. There is a common, general attitude in our world that if science can\u2019t see it, we won\u2019t believe it. But that is foolish. (If you have Bible, look for example at John 20:24\u201331 and Hebrews chapter 11.) Look at it this way: as human beings we are locked up inside a triangle: its three sides are space, time, and logic. We cannot travel in time, we can only be in one place at a time, and two plus two equals four 24/7 (logic, as in math).\nBut God created this triangle, and He floats freely outside of it. And when you talk about spirits, you\u2019re talking about something from God, something supernatural. Science by definition is limited to studying things in the natural realm; God by definition is supernatural.\nNow the topic of spirits is bigger than what I can cover in detail here, but in summary, there are also evil spirits from the devil, who is also supernatural but well below God\u2019s almighty supernatural essence and power and holiness. \u201cMediumship\u201d, mentioned in the question, generally deals in league with the devil, or in a pretend manner, with spirits. (See Isaiah 8:19\u201322) But each of us has our own spirit, basically our soul. God has made us body and soul. But no doctor has ever found a soul in anyone, since again, it is a supernatural entity.\nThere has been much ongoing speculation about spirits since almost the beginning of time. That is unfortunate, because there is no need for this clueless, endless speculation, when we can learn the actual facts about our spirits, our souls, from the One who created them, God Himself. No one else can tell us these facts, but thankfully He does tell us - in His Word, the Bible.\nHe speaks throughout the Bible about our spirits, and He emphasizes to us that this is by far the most important part of us, even though invisible, since it is in our soul, our spirit, where our Christian faith must live. And our Christian faith is based on the Christian faith: the fact that Jesus Christ, God the Son, became also human (born of the Virgin Mary that first Christmas) and paid the penalty of the sins of all human beings of all time by His perfect, sinless earthly life in our place and by His death on the cross to pay the penalty of our sins in our place.\nSo you see, the spirit is our most important part, because that\u2019s where the determination is made whether we end up in hell or in heaven. And this is where another spirit comes in: the Holy Spirit of God; God the Holy Spirit. He is the One who uses the facts, the eternal and universal truths of God\u2019s Word, to bring us to faith in it, to that essential, trusting faith in Jesus Christ as our only Savior from all our sins, the only Way to heaven.\nThat\u2019s a short summary of the Gospel, the great good news of God\u2019s love for us sinners, and of our salvation through trusting faith in Jesus Christ. The details are in the Bible, so please get a copy for yourself and start reading it, studying it, learning it. Yes, the Bible is a big book, and you will likely have all kinds of questions if you are new to it. I will be more than happy to answers any such questions for you; just email me at jhr12447@aol.com.\nGod\u2019s blessings to you in Jesus Christ.\nJonathan Rupprecht", "If the questioner meant to say mediums & spiritists that is 1 thing.

Further, what we call Real phenomena, like aging or radioactive decay, proceed in linear proportion to Real projections of Complex time. But, while Real time depends on relative velocity, Complex time is INVARIANT with respect to velocity. Which means that there is an absolute time for all observers. Since it is Complex, how much of it we can experience depends on the phase angle. And the phase angle is exactly the parametric angle that defines relative velocity, v = c sin(\u03b8).

The idea that time is relative comes from the broken Spacetime models of Einstein\u2019s which generate event-meshing failures which invalidate them, as you\u2019ll see as soon as you try to simulate them. Build one for GTR in which you simulate the gravity version of the twins paradox where one twin is lowered on the end of a long cable to hover over a black hole. When he comes back up after a year, he\u2019s decades younger than his twin sister. If you simulate that by the rules of the model, you have no means to make his clock tick slow: the only time in the model is the time of the time dimension, so he races through to the reunion point long before his sister can arrive there to meet him. That\u2019s an event-meshing failure.\nTo prevent these event-meshing failures in simulations, programmers always have to smuggle Newtonian time into them to govern the progress of the twin who travels the shorter time-length path between the Spacetime location of the separation and the Spacetime location of the reunion, but that control mechanism is explicitly banned in the model. I\u2019ve been asking people for a decade to show me a working simulation of GTR that doesn\u2019t cheat in this way, but no one has one, and the reason no one has one is that it\u2019s impossible to make one. It\u2019s equally impossible for the real universe to run on the rules of GTR.\n(STR also produces event-meshing failures, but it\u2019s easier to hide the cheating in simulations through obfuscation.)", "Good question\nIts irrelevant.

The longer distance to their orbits cause the operating cycle of the atom to take longer. As the electrons lag the neutrons go more positive to hold them closer.

The source can even be a fraction of a sphere, say one third of a sphere\u2019s surface, and it will be an incoming wave, but one cannot use a small fraction of a sphere because then diffraction effects spread the wave before it reaches the focus.\nThis can be stated more technically by saying that a backward wave is a near field phenomenon i.e. the scale of the wave source must be about as large as the radius of the sphere. We actually do it all the time in optics and with radio antennas when we use a collimating mirror or lens. The collimated wave cannot be much smaller than a wavelength thus you can\u2019t focus to a point, a well known theorem in optics. A similar \u201cbackward wave\u201d can be generated using a phased array of antennas placed on a spherical surface or even on a flat plane as long as the phase distribution is spherical.

One pole is blue-shifted, while the other is red-shifted. What this essentially means is the red-shifted pole (\u201cnorth\u201d) pushes on the fabric of space, and the blue-shifted pole (\u201csouth\u201d) pulls on the fabric of space.\nTo explain why this pushing and pulling phenomenon can be considered wave-like, let\u2019s use some black magic to magnetize a spherical lump of iron without the use of an external magnetic field (just so we don\u2019t have any \u201cmixed signals\u201d). When magnetization occurs, the red-shifted pole will push on the fabric of space from the center of the magnetic flux outward to infinity. The rate at which this push occurs is at the speed of light. Likewise, the blue-shifted pole will begin pulling on the fabric of space, extending outward infinitely at the speed of light.\nWhen we consider a magnetic field in this manner, we can see backward-propagating waves (originating from a magnet\u2019s \u201csouth\u201d pole) do in fact exist. Not only that, but earth\u2019s ferromagnetic core itself is performing a very similar action. Contrary to scientific consensus, earth\u2019s primary magnetic poles are actually rotating about its equator. That is to say, the earth-moon relationship is characterized by attraction/repulsion, rather than simple attraction alone. This is why objects fall at a specific rate, rather than simply plummeting at some ungodly speed.\nThe magnetic field we measure with a compass is no more than a secondary field generated by earth\u2019s ferromagnetic core rotating with its poles about its equator, inducing a static field within the liquid mantle whose directionality is in the classical northern and southern directions. You can actually test this by rotating a strong magnet (with its poles rotating about its equator) at the center of a chamber filled with mercury. The rotating field will induce a static field in the mercury whose directionality is on the y-axis, perpendicular to the rotating magnetic field\u2019s axis. A compass will actually prefer this secondary field, as it\u2019s more consistent.\nA gripe one might have with this theory is that earth\u2019s core is well above its Curie point. However, due to the immense pressure it\u2019s under, the iron never actually decoheres, and instead maintains an orderly structure.\nSorry for the tangential rant at the end there, but the truth needs to get out!

To the person who is standing at the centre of the rotating disc and is rotating along with the disc, the motion of the body would appear to be moving further and further away from him even though no force has been applied to the body.\nIt must be noted that since the observer is rotating along with the disc, the observer is in a non-inertial (accelerated) frame of reference. If he tries to apply the kinematic laws of motion to this system, it would appear that there is a force being applied on the body which is making it move away from him, whereas, in reality, there is no such force since the object is actually moving in a straight line path at a constant velocity, as observed in an inertial frame of reference on which the rotating disc is placed.\nHence, to apply the kinematic laws of motion to this non-inertial (accelerated) frame of reference, we invent a non-existent pseudo force and call it the centrifugal force.\nThis pseudo force would then exist even if there is friction and the body is not moving. How do we explain this? We then say that the frictional force is negating the centrifugal force and hence the body is motionless.\nSo, if we want to apply the kinematic laws of motion to this non-inertial (accelerated) frame of reference, we say that there is a frictional force because of the centrifugal force acting on the object.\nHowever, if we do not want to apply the kinematic laws of motion as it is in a non-inertial (accelerated) frame of reference, we say that the frictional force provides the centripetal force acting which is required for the rotational motion of the object.", "There is a tendency of relative motion, because of the inertia of the box.

But how friction operates to become a centripetal force and that is the question.\nWhenever a box or an object is placed on a rotating table , the intermolecular force wants to drag the box with the rotating disc.
