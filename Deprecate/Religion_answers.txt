But the reason you are doubting is bc you have never known Him. There is only one way to come to know Him and make that connection that He personally put into your soul to seek him when you got your act together. That is called predestination. (Rom.8:28–30.) It says without faith it is impossible to please God bc you must first believe that He is. As long as anyone disregards the severity of sin they cannot know God. It says al that is not of faith is sin. The world teaches sin bc it has no clue what holiness is all about. If it did they would do it for the reward or eternal life and all material blessings this world has to offer made by mens hands.\nSo let’s look at what is stopping you from making that connection. Mainly this is the reason He is hidden from everyone, and that is SIN. Most people do not understand what this is all about so when they become religious they still don’t know. They just make up stuff to say that the logos calls ‘their own precepts’ that they teach for their fear of the Lord. But sin is not when you do it but the willingness to do it.\nWhat my Heavenly Father calls ‘sin’ is doing what is right in your own eyes. This is what everyone is taught to do in the world. It is twofold to our being, spirit and soul wise. We (all) are conceived in sin (our mother’s womb called the matrix - this is where the woman who wrote the matrix got it from that the Wakwaoski bros. stole from her) and raised in iniquity. (the world)\nThis causes everyone in the world to sin as they please. Little does everyone know but these two constitute the world being dumb, stupid and ignorant, twofold. Of the world, we come into and the one we go to when we leave this one. But everyone is supposed to walk the earth twice if they do not die and stay dead. This will be salvation to those who are found worthy of every living human that merits it. Very few find it.\nWhat one must do is do what is right in God’s Eyes. This is the beginning of how the connection with Him begins. So don’t think that God loves everybody. He is not like us and loves those who love Him. Have you not read it says of Him in (Rom.9:9–13.) that He loved Jacob but hated Esau who had the firstborn birthright that cannot be rewritten. Yet, He said the older shall serve the younger before there was an Esau bc of Cain and Abel.\nThe way that connection is to be made, and once it is made it is done, is through Mashiah whom the Christian call Jesus, but that is not his name. Its like ‘Kobe Brian’ but they called him “ma ba” bc of what he does. He played basketball. When he retired “ma ba” took on another facet that died with him. Well, the Lord’s name is Emmanuel (Immawnooale’ n Hbw.) which means (Isa.9:6. The Mighty)“God” (not The All-Mighty God WHo is Abba Patyr’) with us. But His Sinless Nature is in His Word that became flesh Adam (the 1st) and the Christ (the last) who is omega Adam As Adam was called the son of God. Lk.3:38.) So all this is to get each man back to God since trying to do it as a group does not work with sinful men. Hence, do the 1st commandment. (you must have the works though - Mk.16:16)\nThe bottom line is going to have to be you making the choice to love God with all of your heart, (spirit-man) soul (the image of God) mind (of Christ wherein there is no will to sin) and all your strength (that has to be from the joy of the Lord). The main reason the Patyr’ wants you to love Him with all your heart is so that He can love you with all of His. The Lord is the ONLY living example of how we should do it. Everyone else is a fake and deceived fraud and in need of salvation themselves. That should tell you right there who is the fake and the real. We know all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.\nThe connection is what restores the glory, except you cannot have it in this world the way those who are worthy shall have it in the millennium. (soon to come) So when God is revealed by the Lord (Matt.11:27–30.) if at all, your glory is held but He gives you the dominion. That ‘dominion’ protects against the curse of the fall. While loving the Heavenly Father with all your heart, soul, mind and strength fulfills the law of Moses. Unless the first commandments is fulfilled you have no protection from the curse of the fall. In fact, it becomes a double curse to your life that connects to the twofold ignorance, stupidity, and dumbness through sin. So don’t trust men.\nThe curse upon the earth disguises God blessing upon man. The blessing of God is His Way that was lost in the garden. To get it back He sent Christ who says he is the only way back to God. So the number one thing you must do is forsake the world, everything and everybody in it, including yourself. Don’t worry! You are not going anywhere and neither is the world you forsake. But that is absolutely necessary in order to love God with all your heart. He cannot share it with anything from the world. You were conceived in it and raised in it too. All who are worship money without regard that is what they are doing.\nWhen you do this the Patyr’ searches your heart with the Holy Spirit to bear witness if you are ready or not. If so, it shows you have the fear of the Lord. The fear of the Lord turns into the love of the Patyr when He is revealed. From then on Elohim rises up from your belly (Jn.7:37.) to let you know Abba Patyr’ is about to visit you. Do not be afraid to tremble in His Presence. (Isa.66:5. Jerm.5:22.) It is always heavy mighty and strong. So let’s get a clearer picture of how you get there. But once you get there you cannot sin again, and you will not even want to. (Heb.6:1–6.)\nSo Mashiah is the Way, Truth and Life. This stands for the order of entering into the Patyr’s Presence that was once given to Moses to construct the tabernacle from the pattern of the sanctuary in the heavens to demonstrate to them how to enter into the Patyr’ Presence. But they refused as a group and so God gave the honor to Moses people of Levi. (Lae-vee’) Christ gives it to individuals ONLY! That means one at a time. That means you cannot bring anyone with you but you can do the revealing once Christ reveals the Patyr’ to you, like I am doing. Very few find it.\nTo make an impossible explanation, you have to fulfill righteousness by walking with him in your daily life. When I came along it was ripe for street witnessing, going to the fatherless, the widow, prisons, hospitals, praying for the sic, raising the dead, praying for people to be filled with the Holy Spirit. (I still like doing) But now it is a time of personal danger Oh! And get baptized in water. But you must turn from your sinful life, evil thinking and wicked ways. There are layers in the curse of the fall and of the law. Here are the fulfillment scriptures - Matt.11:19–30.Rom.12:1–7.II Pet.1:3,5,10. And read the bible from cover to cover until he comes - Deut.17:19.\nWhen He is revealed He brings you to the secret place (Ps.91:1-.) that is His Presence called Pawneem’ where coronovirus cannot touch you. This is where He gives you His precepts upon precepts, line upon line, a little here…” And these are twofold (repeated) and also match the threefold; way, truth and life if you can see it. (PuP, LuL, Alh) Those precepts He gives you are broken down in Ps.119:1–176. These ‘precepts’ are broken down of 8 verses each to be under the Hebrew alphabet.(22) Some KJV have them already under the alphabet heading. In each one, you will find the word ‘precept’ unless hidden. (once)\nOnce you learn the precepts He put your name in His book of Remembrenmace - Mal.3:16–18. He opens the mystery of His Name (aleph and tav 1st and last of the alphabet) by giving you His Spirit He calls Ruach - Zech.4:6. With Ruach (or as the Jews say - roo’akh) comes Wisdom and Understanding. Wisdom gives her double secrets (mishnah tal’alluman chakmah) while Understanding breaks down the dew from heavens in the morning. This is the connection until death comes if the Lord tarry. But I tell you he will not tarry, and the signs of the times are upon us heavy.

How are they observed? Which countries have similar regulations?\nI think this is more of a German thing.\nThe so-called silent holidays, also known as Silent Days, enjoy special protection under the different holiday laws of the German federal states( Bundesländer).\nLife is slower on public holidays: shops and schools are closed, many employees do not have to work. But on some of these days, particularly strict regulations apply. These include Good Friday (Karfreitag) (the last Friday before Easter), All Saints\' Day (November 1), Sunday of Death (Totensonntag) the German-Protestant equivalent of All Souls Day and the Day of National Mourning or Memorial Day (the second last Sunday before the first Advent). Which holiday is considered a "silent holiday is regulated by the federal states in their holiday laws. Almost all of them have a church connection. The regulations stipulate what is forbidden on these days.\nEaster, with the commemoration of Jesus\' death and resurrection, is one of the highest holidays for Christians - and on Good Friday, the Day of Jesus\' death on the cross, the strictest regulations apply in many federal states. In North Rhine-Westphalia, for example, public festivals, sporting events and markets are prohibited. Shops are closed and film screenings must be approved by the Minister of Culture. There is a ban on music and dancing until 6 a.m. on Holy Saturday.\nThis includes "all non-public entertainment events outside of homes". Especially the dance ban is repeatedly criticized by younger people. But the church representatives consider it indispensable. " The special character of Good Friday as a day of rest, reflection and contemplation is inseparable from the cultural form of this day," is the reason given by the German Bishops\' Conference. Nevertheless, in recent years the ban on dancing has been relaxed in some federal states. In Schleswig-Holstein where I reside, it is now valid from Friday morning, 2 o\'clock, until Saturday morning, 2 o\'clock. Until 2016, the ban on Good Friday from 0 to 24 o\'clock was valid. Today\'s regulations, however, cannot be compared with the strict rules of the Middle Ages.

This religion was called Judaism.\nThen two people took the religion and modified it for their people.\nConstantine - Constantine was a Roman emperor who ruled early in the 4th century. He was the first Christian emperor and saw the empire begin to become a Christian state. The Fifty Bibles of Constantine were Bibles in the original Greek language commissioned in 331 by Constantine I and prepared by Eusebius of Caesarea. They were made for the use of the Bishop of Constantinople in the growing number of churches in that very new city.\n\ni.e. Constantine I wrote the Bible based on the religious beliefs of the Jews, and modified it to add Christ. The Jews reject this new addition, and Christianity and Judaism diverged.\nProphet Muhammad - Prophet Muhammad claimed that God has spoken to him, and revealed the teaching of God to him, which he wrote in the Quran, the Holy book of the Muslims. The start of Islam is marked in the year 610, following the first revelation to the prophet Muhammad at the age of 40. Muhammad and his followers spread the teachings of Islam throughout the Arabian peninsula.\n\nIslam diverged from Christianity and Judaism.\n\nIt should be noted that Islam, Christianity and Judaism share the same roots, and in many aspects, are similar. The same characters Adam, Eve, etc are in all 3 books.\nAs you can see from the above, what happens is that men of power and standing tailored the religion to their own benefits and begin to spread their ‘new’ religion.\nSo what happened in Judaism is no exception.\nOne man spilt it into Christianity. Another man spilt it into Islam.\nWithin Christianity, man further diverges it away from “God’s teaching.”\nThe Reformation began in 1517 when a German monk called Martin Luther protested about the Catholic Church. His followers became known as Protestants. Many people and governments adopted the new Protestant ideas, while others remained faithful to the Catholic Church. This led to a split in the Church.\nAgain, note that the religion is spilt by man, and diverged from the Catholic Church.\nMormonism is the predominant religious tradition of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity started by Joseph Smith in Western New York in the 1820s and 30s.\nThe word Mormon originally derived from the Book of Mormon, a religious text published by Smith, which he said he translated from golden plates with divine assistance. The book describes itself as a chronicle of early indigenous peoples of the Americas and their dealings with God. Based on the book's name, Smith's early followers were more widely known as Mormons, and their faith Mormonism.\nMormons believe that Jesus paid for the sins of the world and that all people can be saved through his atonement. Mormons accept Christ's atonement through faith, repentance, formal covenants or ordinances such as baptism, and consistently trying to live a Christ-like life.\nAgain, note that a man spilt the teaching of Christ.\nJehovah's Witnesses originated as a branch of the Bible Student movement, which developed in the United States in the 1870s among followers of Christian Restorationist minister Charles Taze Russell. Bible Student missionaries were sent to England in 1881 and the first overseas branch was opened in London in 1900.\nAgain, noted that a man spilt the teaching of Christ further, away from the Church, and created a new religion - the Jehovah Witnesses.\nWestboro Baptist Church originated as a branch of the East Side Baptist Church, established in 1931 on the east side of Topeka. In 1954, East Side hired Fred Phelps as an associate pastor, and then promoted him to pastor of their new church plant, Westboro Baptist, which opened in 1955 on the west side of Topeka.\nSoon after Westboro was established, Phelps broke ties with East Side, and many members (who originally joined Westboro from East Side, in order to help it become an autonomous congregation) eventually left and either returned to East Side or went to other churches.\nWestboro Baptist Church is an American church known for its use of inflammatory hate speech, especially against LGBT+ people, Catholics, Orthodox Christians, atheists, Muslims, Jews, and U.S. soldiers and politicians.\nAnother man spilt the Christianity religion and use it for evil.\nAs you can see from the above, what happened is that religions are not created by Christ. Religions are created by man.\nThat is why there are many different denominations of Christianity. Even Christianity itself is created by one man, Constantine, and it diverged from Judaism.", 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 12, 2020'}, 1: {'view': 26, 'user_name': 'Paul Marra', 'answer': 'Early Christianity was a small sect within Judaism, which is the preceding messianic religion.

Both the Greek (Eastern) and Latin (Western) church held this creed in honor, though with one important difference — the Western church insisted on the inclusion of the phrase “and the Son” (known as the filioque) in the article on the procession of the Holy Spirit ; this phrase is still repudiated by the Eastern Orthodox Church. In its present form, this creed goes back partially to the Council of Nicea (AD 325) with additions by the Council of Constantinople (AD381). It was accepted in its present form at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, but the filioque phrase was not added until 589.

Let’s unpack this somewhat.\nDon’t confuse the realms of Faith and Healthcare.\nIf Healthcare is ineffective, there will be no humans to partake in Faith. Get your priorities right. (In the same vein, Healthcare and Human Rights (e.g. with respect to lockdowns). If there are no humans left, we don’t need Human Rights.)\nDo not religionize (and politicize) Healthcare. Healthcare must be able to hold its own to do its due job. Mess with that and we get sub-optimal through disastrous Healthcare outcomes, which will benefit neither Healthcare nor Faith.\nHealthcare is essentially in the realm of Science and Technology, then girded by Humanism.\nScience discovers nature, e.g. find out more about COVID19.\nTechnology uses scientific knowledge to influence, shape, manage and control nature e.g. manage COVID19 with medicines.\nReligion (and Philosophy, Humanism in the secular realm) gives meaning to Science, Technology and nature.\nWhy is COVID19 upon us?\nWhy are innocent young children and good people falling to COVID19?\nMy dad died of COVID19. Why? Why him of all people?\nDue to a shortage of ventilators, the hospitals are according priority to young over old people. My infected old mum didn’t get her turn. How do I make sense of this?\nBe clear-minded how each realm of Science, Technology and Faith (religion) relate to nature.\nPlaces of worship are an important channel of Faith. But, in times of emergencies, there are alternative channels e.g. technology-enabled channels. They may not be ideal, but they are viable temporary alternatives.\nFaith is metaphysical, faith is abstract by design. Faith should not be uncomfortable operating outside of a physical house of worship. This pervasiveness and persistence of Faith is its essence and power. COVID19 is a test of this essence, whether by design or not.\nThis is the perspective of an atheist.', 'upvote': 4, 'date': 'Apr 12, 2020'}, 1: {'view': 64, 'user_name': 'Robin Ward', 'answer': 'Not really\nYou can still pray alone ,or with family , God hears , whatever the situation\nHe does not always answer with a resounding YES , or immediately —but ,He DOES hear\nYou can still give tithes by bank transfer ,if you can afford it.

I say this as a Christian… but let me take their side and tell you what I believe they are afraid of:\nWe have seen quite a few over-zealous pastors and flocks of various faiths flouting common-sense restrictions on movement, and in doing so, they have inadvertently (hopefully inadvertently, but maybe not in some cases) caused pockets of outbreak of this virus. Also, they have been unfortunately re-interpreting scripture to suggest that God will protect obedient followers from suffering illness no matter what (that’s not true, Biblically or otherwise). In addition, some have even gone so far as to claim that this disease is a judgment from God, and even further still, I would not be surprised if some zealots would purposely infect themselves and their flock and direct them to go out and purposely infect others in order to “carry out” God’s judgment on unbelievers. Unfortunately, they would probably be infecting plenty of believers, too.\nMaybe it’s a judgment from God. I don’t know. Do people who claim it is really know? The answer is almost certainly NO!\nThe Left is fuming over the defiance of certain religious populations in gathering publicly and ignoring other restrictions because of their faith, and they are RIGHT!\nThey are right… but for the wrong reasons.\nThey are right that certain forms of religious sentiment are a danger to society, especially now. They are right that superstition in a time where facts save lives is absolutely deadly. They are right that people need to re-examine their relationship with their faith and that society needs to re-examine its relationship with religious institutions.\nThey are right… but for the wrong reasons.\nYou see, most on the left view religious faith in its entirety as dangerous, stupid, evil, and in need of complete eradication. Many of those irreligious on the left that do not directly wish for religion to disappear or be banned probably wouldn’t put up much of a fuss if religion began being regulated out of public existence. A good portion would welcome an absolutely religion-free public sphere\nThey wrongly believe that religion is the cause of most, if not all, social ills, and they wrongly think that the world would in turn become a utopia of scientific glory without past “superstitions” to impede its seemingly absolute rationality. They wrongly believe that all of religion is mere superstition, that all religious people are brainwashed, and that all intelligent “free-thinkers” would come to the same realization as them: that religion is a useless vestige of human evolution which has overstayed its welcome.\nAnd so many on the left (as witnessed on this very website) have taken towards the habit of blaming religion solely for the perceived poor execution of lockdown and social distancing measures which has caused the virus to spread further and faster than it might have had religion been a very negligible factor, such as it is in China.\nYet I can only think of a few known cases in this country where religion has played a part in the disregard for public safety.\nI can, however, think of many recent cases which have become infamous, in which the probable cause of such flagrant, dim-witted, or malicious disregard for public safety, was probably much more due to the rampant NIHILISM caused by lack of religious sentiment.\nPardon me for playing the devil’s advocate here, but if we’re all just a collection of cells floating on an insignificant speck in the middle of an inconceivably vast yet inherently meaningless universe…\nWhy not go on spring break?\nWhy not lick random grocery store items?\nWhy not spread the virus intentionally to instill terror?\nWhy not do drugs, drink alcohol, fornicate with anything that can be fornicated with, rebel against any and all authority, and be a completely irresponsible dumbass threat to all that is good and worth protecting?\nThere is no reason not to! There is no reason to listen to silly experts spouting concrete seeming absurdity because LIFE MEANS NOTHING!\nThat’s pretty scary… but very few atheists or anti-theists, or the emerging religiophobes… want to go there. That involves too much introspection, too much raw existential dread.\nSo they blame religion. It’s an easy target. Science gives everyone a very big stick with which to hit people they perceive as less than them or a threat to them. People like big sticks and hitting others with said stick.\nAny Christian of any spiritual integrity whatsoever should be perfectly at home in this atmosphere, though. We don’t need to gather at all costs. We don’t need society’s support. We don’t need government protection or status as an “essential” service.\nWe just need our faith in God and a Bible if we have one (which we usually do). We can pray all day and all night if we want, no matter where we are, who we are with, or what we are doing. We can confess our sins to God alone. We can receive His discipline and His comfort in private. We can even thrive even more if society turns so sour on us that excessive persecution begins anew.\nWe’re all good. Nothing to fear from us.\nAs for those Christian groups who have decided that common sense is bad and that Christ condones insurrection and that conspiracy theories (yes even the best and most probable ones… and there are some probable ones) are of higher authority than scripture and God…\nWell… what about all that tolerance we’ve been hearing so much about from you social justice warriors the past few years?\nRemember that lecture you gave your Christian friends about tolerance?\nDid you misplace it?

You will find the answer. When you surrender to Krishn all mistakes are forgiven. And after surrendering when you have given yourself in His care, can you commit any mistake!\nRead. Below is hidden your answer.\nCome to Me I am the Way.Lord Krishna orders or rather invites Arjun in Geeta, to abandon all duties . “Abandoning dependence on all duties that is Dharma take refuge in me alone. I shall liberate you from your sins; therefore grieve not.”(Geeta,18.66).\nDoes it mean giving up all duties? When we interpret any matter we take recourse to the ordinary meaning, the reference in which the words have been spoken, the logical purport, the implicit meaning, the real spirit behind the matter and finally how the same person has explained such a preposition before or after somewhere else. Various Geeta pandits have given their varied views. The three most popular ones are:- first, that abandonment of duties is not envisaged but dependence on Dharma, that is, duties are to be given up; second, the fruits of duties are to be given up and not duties themselves; third, all duties have to be left and refuge to be taken in the Lord.\nVotaries of the first view that is “dependence on duties is to be left but not duty itself ” cite Krishn: ‘Action of sacrifice yag, charity, dan and penance tap are not to be given up but should be performed for these are the purifier of the wise; even these actions as also other duties should be performed, giving up attachment and desire for fruits. O Parth ! ( another name of Arjun) this is my decisive and firm belief.(18.6.) He also opines that without action ‘Karma’ a person cannot even live his life for nature (प्रकृति) compels action. Even for a moment a person cannot exist without doing some action( Gita 3. 4, 5 and 8).\nUpholders of the second view state that the keyword is ‘relinquishment’ (tyag, त्याग). And the fruit of duties is to be abandoned, not duties.These put reliance on chapter 18 vs 2. “The learned declare abandonment of the fruits of all actions as relinquishment Tyag’’.For them ‘Dharam’ has different connotations at different places in Geeta . In Chapter 2 vs 40 ‘Dharam’ is used in the context of karmayog. “In the path of karmyog there is neither loss of effort nor any adverse result. Even a little practice of this dharma protects one from the great danger of birth- and- death cycle.” In chapter 9 verse 3 the reference is to gyan Yog (ज्ञान योग)”. “People devoid of faith in this dharma, knowledge (ज्ञान) fail to reach me…... and remain caught up in the recurring cycle of births and rebirths . “In chapter 14 verse 27, it is used in the sense of devotion bhakti. “I am the Abode of Brahm, the Immortal and the Imperishable, of Eternal Dharma and of Absolute Bliss”. Thus the word “Dharm” is interpreted by them in the contexts of action (Karmyog) knowledge (Dhyan Yog) and devotion (Bhakti Yog).\nThe third school believes in the literal meaning, that is, “give up all duties and come to me’’.They maintain that Lord up till now has revealed many ways to attain Him. Now Lord shows ‘The Way’ Rajpath (राजपथ), that is, the easiest path. Something like what Jesus says after about 3000 years(John14/6)“I am the way, the truth, the light ...no one comes to the Father except through ME." Lord Krishna before revealing The Way confides in Arjun that the lord is now going to open a top secret. Up till now, right from the very start of Gita, Bhagwan Krishn, was imparting his knowledge. In chapter2vs.1, Bhagwan says HE is unfolding mysterious knowledge. Again (in 9/34)uses words My devotee ( मनमना; मद भक्ता:) “Fix your mind on Me”. Further (in 14/27), “I am the basis and foundation of eternal Dhram….’’. From chapter eighteen18 verse sixft three. it appears that Bhagwan Krishn is about to break hidden knowledge which is more secret than all secrets. In verse sixty four the words used are “’My supremely secret word’’, just before the explosion is verse sixty five : “Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, worship Me, prostrate before Me; so shall you come to Me alone; I promise you truly for you are dear to Me….’’. Now the final unveiling in verse sixty six : “Resigning all your duties to Me, all-powerful and all-supporting Lord, take refuge in Me alone, I shall absolve you of all sins, worry not.’’ The sanctity and importance of this topmost secret is augmented when in verse sixty seven Lord forbids Arjun - “this is never to be mentioned by you to anyone who performs no austerity or has no devotion or is unwilling to hear, or who finds fault with Me." Moreover Lord asks Arjun whether Arjun has understood the top most secret. To which Arjun replies, “Achutya (अच्युत) my delusion is destroyed and memory is gained through Your grace I stand firm with my doubts dispelled and I shall act according to your word.’’ The phrase used is ‘vachanam tvam’ (वचनं त्वां) meaning thereby, according to your word’ as you say’. Arjun is not saying as You talk but as You say. Now it is self evident that a person who has surrendered to God or Guru does whatever God or Guru commands him to do. On the other hand a person who follows the path of righteousness does what the dharma dictates . If it was that Lord was asking what he taught before in verses sixty five and sixty six of chapter eighteen, Arjun’s answer would have been ” as you taught’’ However by using words ” as you say ’’ Arjun implies he has surrendered to and is a disciple of Krishna and is in total obedience. This surrendering to Krishna is later proved when Arjun kills Karan who was not on his chariot and unarmed. An act strictly not in accordance with Dharma. That Bhagvan (God) had only giving up all Dharma for those who take refuge in him (when he lifted the veil from the secret most knowledge in verses sixty five and sixty six of chapter eighteen)can be interpreted from what Krishna has said about Dharma elsewhere. For example, in Bhagwat the very same Krishn says, “That alone which engenders devotion (Bhakti) for me is Dharma."(-11:19:27). Again from Bhagwat--- “Has evil ever befallen him anywhere [ in womb or birth] who adores the Lotus-feet of Sri Hari, neglecting his duty (धर्म); even if he dies at the stage when he is still unripened in his devotion, or falls from sadhana (साधना) ? On the other hand what purpose has been achieved by those who fail to worship God but are devoted to their duty.(1.5.17).These are the words of Sage Narad [नारद], from Bhagvat, who is considered an avatar of the Supreme. Krishn extols the person who neglects his duties [knowing fully well that doing duties is a virtue and neglect is a sin] for the sake of His worship.(-11.11.32 Bhagvat) . What the Lord taught Arjun in Chapter eighteen verses sixty five and sixty six of Geeta, the very same wisdom He again taught Udhav in Bhagwat :- “Therefore turning your back upon all do\'s and don\'ts and renouncing all activity and the cessation from all activity and rejecting that which has been learnt and that which has yet to be learnt, O Udhav ! seek as your refuse Me alone---- you will be rid of fear from all quarters(-11.12. 14-15)-. No doubt is left now. Just before he put an end to His Leela (लीला) pass times on earth, Krishna shows The Way, the same one which was shown to Arjun, to Udhav also. That is dependence on the Lord alone, and nothing else. Your dependence should be like a newborn’s on its mother, the child knows nothing except crying. All needs are taken care of by the mother. Be the cat’s kitten doing nothing and being totally dependent on mother("vidal nyaya" न्याय) .The kitten does nothing ,the cat takes complete care of it. The monkey- child,on the other hand, has to hold its mother tightly with it\'s own strength,lest it fall मर्कट न्याय.\nThe best Dharma is that which has devotion (bhakti) for Krishn, without any worldly desire.(Bhagwat-11.2.6). Once the goal, that is, attainment of Shri Krishn is reached, what use are the means. If a person has found an infinite ocean of water, will he beg for a glass of water, he who has attained Braham Gyan (ब्रहम ज्ञान), will he study the vedas ? (Geeta chapter 2 v\'s 46). In layman\'s language if I have been gifted a big palace with many rooms, kitchens, gardens, drawing rooms etc. and I am in possession of the whole palace, will it be prudent for me to again ask the donor to give me the drawing room, which is already a part of the palace. No.The same with God. Once we have attained God by taking refuge in him, what need have we of Dharma, and for that matter Gyan ,too. The end result is God, which we already have.\nLearned persons, like Sh.Paraser Bhatter, also hold this view. “To attain Me [liberation], I am the only means, decide this; leave aside all [karma yog, gyan yog and bhakti yog] that I have taught you in Gita till now and take refuge in Me only. I shall free you of all sins; grieve not looking to the gravity of sins. He who surrenders to Me becomes dependent on Me and fearless forever.’’ The recourse to surrender i.e. prapati [प्रपत्ति ] is available to all at all times at all places and in all situations.Such is its all encompassing reach.\nWhat about those who are only strivers and and have not completely surrendered to or have taken full refuge in the Lord, but to a certain degree have surrendered to the Lord. Such as these can also skip duties but to a limited extent . “He should perform those duties which make him introvert, he can avoid those that make him an extrovert. Rules of cleanliness and other karmakand (कर्मकांड ) are not mandatory(-11.10. 4,5 Bhagwat).People like these should follow only those precepts, conducive to devotion, bhakti, and those that come in the way of devotion are to be given up, that is, need not be followed.Bhagwan Shri Ram while teaching Shri Hanuman puts scriptural do\'s and don\'ts on a lower pedestal than surrendering to God, that is, Bhakti. The supreme one teaches that those who,leave devotion and are lost in the pit of shashtra can neither attain true knowledge, gyan, nor salvation for a hundred births(Adhyatma Ramayana1.1.51).\nThe first conclusion that dependence on “Dharma to be left but not Dharma” cannot be said to be fully correct. It is like saying use money and material wealth but you should not be dependent on them. This just cannot be possible. If I use money and the things it can fetch me I am dependent on money. If in a given situation I follow my duties I am very much dependent on duties that is Dharma. Scholars admit, about abandonment of duties : “Krishn means to say that all duties must be performed for Him alone; by doing so one will not depend on duties but will depend on God only. The Lord declares that those dependent on duties are subject to both birth and death-- (c 9/21Geeta).But depending only on Him one need not decide what to do or what not to do in a given situation ,as already discussed above in the case of Arjun killing Karan. Here Arjun followed Krishna’s instructions and not Dharam. Those who hold this view are in reality advocating dependence of God and not on dharma. In the above illustration when Arjun killed Karan, what did he do? Did he follow dharma? Answer is no. Then what did he follow? He followed the advice or rather the command of Krishn; had he followed Dharma he might not have slain an unarmed person. So when you have taken refuge in the lord the Lord is with you. No more dhama, yag, yog or dan for you. Now only He is your All sufficiency in all things. “I am His and He is mine’ is also your dominant thought. He\'ll take care of your every need as per his promise in chapter kisinineverse twenty two of Gita.\nThe second inference ‘that dharma is not to be abandoned but the fruits of Dharma are to be given up ‘cannot be regarded as the intent of Krishn in Verse 66 in Chapter 18. He has right from the beginning, that is, the 2nd chapter of Gita directed forsaking of fruits. Why would he repeat Himself? When we study Gita carefully we find that Lord has not repeated Himself even once. Even verse forty seven of Chapter six and verses two of chapter twelve ; and then again verse thirty four of chapter nine and verse sixty five of chapter eighteen are not exactly the same. WHY what has already been revealed, that is “ giving up the fruit of action’’, would be called by Lord as the most secret knowledge. “Giving up fruit’’ is already revealed wisdom, so it cannot be a secret anymore.\nTo understand abandonment of Dharma that is verse sixty sixof chapter eighteen we have to meditate on the special privileges and concessions granted to devotees. Shri Krishna goes to the utmost extent of being liberal towards devotees. Many devotees who surrender to the Lord have desire for pleasures, knowing fully well that they bring sorrow. For such devotees the Lord says in Bhagvat (11/20/27-29)that they may enjoy these desires but should pray to Him with resolve to free them from wishes. God says that those who worship and remember Him make Him enter their hearts. His entry into their hearts destroys the devotees’ passions and desires. Extolling devotion, that is, taking refuse exclusively in the Lord, He goes on to say that even wisdom Gyan (ज्ञान ) which is devoid of devotion is not adorable 12/12/52 Bhagva).\nFrom what we have discussed so far it is clear that the third view, that is, taking refuse in the Lord only and giving up on duties, is what the lord meant in verse sixty six of chapter eighteen .\nNobody should think that we can practically give up all activity for human beings are not made up that way. Nature compels action. To live and for our very existence we have to do action. What all the three views in essence try to bring home is that we have to follow the Lord first and all else, that is Dharma, Yog, Dhyan, yagya and gyan are secondary. It is akin to what Jesus asserted in the Bible. "Seek first The Kingdom of Heaven [that is God] and all else shall be added," i.e. material wealth(Matthew 6.33).. Compare this with (9/22 Geeta) .\nThus from deep analysis, the third view seems to be correct, especially because Krishn gives the same advice to Udhav later on in Bhagvat which He had given to Arjuna in Geeta( 11/12/14-15).\nMATERIAL relied:--Geeta ,Bhagvat, Bible\nend', 'upvote': 2, 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020'}, 1: {'view': 'error', 'user_name': 'Hetvi Kotak', 'answer': '', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 15, 2020'}}, 'question_title': 'Would God forgive us for our mistakes or guide us to the right path?', 'question_author': 'Dhanush J'}, 154: {'no_of_view': '245', 'no_of_follower': 1, 'create_time': 'Apr 15, 2020', 'topic_list': ['Orthodox Christianity', 'Religion and Marriage', 'Pedophilia', 'Orthodox Judaism', 'Denominations and Organized Religion', 'Judaism', 'Philosophy of Religion', 'Adult Question', 'Adult Dating and Relationships', 'Marriage', 'Religion'], 'answer_count': 1, 'respond': {0: {'view': 7, 'user_name': 'Mehmed C.

For starters Everyone of them is mutually exclusive. That means that their doctrine declares: either you believe what we say or you are wrong.\nIn the situation regarding the Judeo-Christian faiths they even disagree with each other, each declaring theirs is the only way. When organizations go about their business in this manner you have to appreciate there is no way they could NOT take hate.\nWhy would a Christian do anything other than hate jews? The jews rejected their saviour in favour of a murderer and then celebrated his death. How could muslims NOT hate jews? In their stories the Jews rejected everything god ever tried to give them? How could the Jews not hate the christians? They hijacked their entire faith and then trivialized it.\nWhen people go around declaring that their belief structure is the only valid belief structure on the planet, people will rightfully lash back. Why wouldn’t they? they are right to. Organized religion is just a massive sweeping sham, it is the epicenter of most of the worlds conflict.

Traditionally Women, homosexuals and people who disagree with their faith are heavily discriminated against. When you single out groups and pretend they are going to hell you should probably expect them to turn around and do the same.\nReligion is a fun tool for people lacking in moral direction.

I am going to go with how I read the question - as a contrast between faith in someone else (the understood inference is faith in God) and faith in yourself. I also for brevity, assume they both are achievers.\nA self reliant person is one who has the confidence to back themselves. They don’t need to be propped up or continuously supported.\nA self reliant person is not the same as a being a Lone Ranger. One who is confident in their own abilities does not rule out being able to work with a team to achieve things.\nA person of faith can also be one who is supremely confident but the confidence comes from outside, not in themselves. It comes from knowing someone has your back, will be there when natural knowledge or ability comes to an end.\nSometimes it can be very difficult to distinguish between the two types of achievers. They both can rise to the top.\nSo the question remains- can they conflict? Can a self reliant person rely on or have faith in someone else?\nAs I type this it seems obvious to me that a self reliant person working with a team of others is exercising faith all the time. The big question is can he rely on or have faith that God will extend his own capacity to be more than he is normally capable of?\nIn my experience the big standout quality for a person of faith is humility. It is this humility that enables him to rely on God without necessarily thinking less of himself.\nAt the same time, a self reliant person can also have humility. Not every naturally capable person knows everything or is able to do everything. We all have limits. Unless you are the smartest person in the room or a big fish in a small pond, you will come up against your own limitations despite your natural talents. It is in knowing ones limits that a self reliant person is able to also be a person of faith.\nIt is a proud person who refuses to believe in God to be able to achieve more. It can be difficult to be self reliant and be of faith but it is not impossible. Faith and self reliance are able to coexist in a person and not conflict.

Occasional incidents happened in surrounding regions, like North Ossetia-Alania, Karachay-Cherkessia, Stavropol Krai and Volgograd Oblast.\nHistory and background\nMap of the North Caucasus\nIn late 1999, Russia\'s Premier, Vladimir Putin, ordered military, police and security forces to enter the breakaway region of Chechnya. By early 2000, these forces occupied most of the region. High levels of fighting continued for several more years and resulted in thousands of Russian and Chechen casualties and hundreds of thousands of displaced persons. In 2005, Chechen rebel leader, Abdul-Halim Sadulayev, decreed the formation of a Caucasus Front against Russia, among Islamic believers in the North Caucasus, in an attempt to widen Chechnya\'s conflict with Russia. After his death, his successor, Dokka Umarov, declared continuing jihad to establish an Islamic fundamentalist Caucasus Emirate in the North Caucasus and beyond. Russia\'s pacification policy in Chechnya has involved setting up a pro-Moscow regional government and transferring more local security duties to this government.\nAn important factor in Russia\'s apparent success in Chechnya has been reliance on pro-Moscow Chechen clans affiliated with regional President Ramzan Kadyrov. Terrorist attacks in the North Caucasus appeared to increase substantially in 2007–2010. In the summer of 2009, more than 442 persons died in North Caucasus violence in just four months as compared to only 150 deaths reported in the entire year of 2008.\nIn the whole year 2009, according to the official figures by the Russian government, 235 Interior Ministry personnel (Defense Ministry and the FSB losses not included) were killed and 686 injured,\nwhile more than 541 alleged fighters and their supporters were killed and over 600 detained.\nThe rate of increase of terrorist incidents lessened in 2010, as compared to 2008–2009, however the rate of civilian casualties substantially increased throughout the North Caucasus in 2010 and a rising number of terrorist incidents took place outside of Chechnya.\nIn the period from 2010 to 2014, the number of casualties in the North Caucasus insurgency declined each year, with the overall death toll falling by more than half.\nReasons suggested for the decline include the deaths of high-ranking insurgency commanders, the increased targeting by security forces of the support infrastructure relied on by the insurgents, and an exodus of insurgents to other conflict zones.\nA special investigation by Reuters claimed that in the lead-up to the 2014 Sochi Olympics, Russian security services had allowed and encouraged militants to leave Russia to fight in the Syrian Civil War, in order to reduce the risk of domestic attacks.\nChechnya\nThe insurgency in the North Caucasus is a direct result of the two post-Soviet wars fought between Russia and Chechnya. The First Chechen War was a nationalist struggle, with both secular and Islamist overtones, for independence from Russia and took place between 1994 and 1996. After a vicious struggle between Russian federal forces and Chechen separatist guerrillas, Chechnya was granted de facto independence per the terms of the Khasavyurt Accord, signed on 30 August 1996. With a devastated infrastructure and various armed factions, subordinate to specific warlords, the next three years saw Chechnya devolve into a corrupted and criminal state, plagued by armed gangs, an epidemic of kidnappings-for-ransom and the rise of radical Islam in the region as a response to suppression.\nIn August 1999, an armed incursion of 1,500 Islamic radicals, led by Chechen warlord, Shamil Basayev, and Arab jihadist, Ibn al-Khattab, in support of a Dagestani separatist movement, combined with a series of apartment bombings in Russia, gave Moscow sufficient reasoning for re-invading Chechnya, thus triggering the Second Chechen War, a conflict fought with significant Islamist overtones.\nHaving learned harsh lessons from the first war, the Russian military, rather than getting entangled in messy urban engagements such as that seen in Grozny in 1994–95, relied heavily on aerial bombardment and artillery such as ballistic missiles and fuel air explosives, typically surrounding and then destroying any towns or villages that put up resistance before sending in ground forces for mop-up operations. The second Battle of Grozny in 1999–2000 saw the bulk of Chechen resistance smashed, particularly after a column of some 2,000 fighters attempted to break out of the besieged city in February 2000 and instead walked directly into a minefield that Russian forces had prepared for an ambush. What remained of the decimated rebel units then withdrew into the inaccessible Vedeno and Argun gorges in the southern mountains of the republic in order to wage a guerrilla campaign.\nThe republic remained a major center of violence for many years. According to Russian figures, between April 2009 (when the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya was officially ended) and April 2010, 97 servicemen were killed in Chechnya; at the same time, government forces killed 189 persons claimed to be militants or their collaborators.\nReported casualties declined, with 26 security forces and 24 suspected militants being killed in 2014.\nDagestan\nFSB Spetsnaz members during an anti-terrorist operation in Makhachkala, Dagestan.\nDagestan is the most religious, populous and complex of all the north Caucasian republics.\nIt is double the size of Chechnya and consists of several dozen ethnic groups, most with their own language.\nThe conflict in Dagestan, however, is not between ethnic groups but between Sufism, a syncretic form of Islam which includes local customs and recognises the state, and Salafism, a more traditional form which rejects secular rule and insists that the Salafist interpretation of Islam should govern all spheres of life.\nDagestan has the highest levels of violence and extremism in the North Caucasus republics.\nThe Russian Interior Ministry stated that of the 399 terrorist crimes committed in the North Caucasus in 2013, 242 were in Dagestan.\nBy 2017, all subversive and terrorist groups operating in Dagestan were eliminated.\nIngushetia\nAlong with Dagestan, Ingushetia bore the brunt of the violence in the North Caucasus in the Insurgencies early years. The Islamist insurgency in the republic sprang from the wars in neighbouring Chechnya in the 1990s and early 2000s. In June 2004, Ingush and Chechen fighters launched a large-scale attack on Ingushetia\'s biggest town, Nazran, killing scores of civilians, policemen and soldiers.\nAs elsewhere in the North Caucasus, the brutality of state security forces has been a major factor, driving young men to join the Islamists. Under the presidency of the former KGB officer, Murat Zyazikov, teams of masked operatives kidnapped, tortured and killed suspected rebels and members of their families. Zyazikov\'s successor, Yunus-bek Yevkurov, appointed in 2008, had success in dampening the violence, although he was seriously injured in a suicide bombing by the militants during his first year in office. Human rights violations by Russian commandos decreased, but remained widespread.\nThe capture of Ali Taziev in June 2010, an ethnic Ingush and one of the top leaders of the Caucasus Emirate, dealt a blow to the jihadists in Ingushetia, with the number of attacks falling substantially over the next 5 years.\nIn mid-2015, Ingushetia\'s president, Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, stated that the insurgency in the Republic had been \'defeated\'.\nKabardino-Balkaria\nThe insurgency in Kabardino-Balkaria began in the early 2000s and was led by the Yarmuk Jamaat, a militant Islamist jamaat which flourished as a result of persecution of pious Muslims by police and security forces.\nIn October 2005, several score of the militants launched a raid on the capital of the republic, Nalchik, which left 142 people dead. The guerrillas have also carried out numerous assassinations of government officials and law enforcement officers.\nThe republic saw a flare-up of violence in late 2010 and early 2011, in the wake of the death of Anzor Astemirov, a senior figure in the Caucasus Emirate and the head of its United Vilayat of Kabarda, Balkaria and Karachay. The new leaders of Kabardino-Balkaria\'s guerrilla movement, Asker Dzhappuyev and Ratmir Shameyev, preferred a more aggressive approach and the militants murdered several civilians in the republic, including Russian tourists. In response, a vigilante group called the Black Hawks threatened the relatives of some of the Islamists.\nDzhappuyev and Shameyev were killed in a special operation by security forces in April 2011.\nCasualties fell in the following years. There was a total of 49 people (militants, security forces and civilians) reported killed in the republic over the whole of 2014.\nNorth Ossetia-Alania\nOn 9 September 2010, a car-bomb attack occurred at a crowded marketplace in Vladikavkaz, the capital of North Ossetia, killing 19 adults and children, and injuring over 190. President Medvedev responded, that "we will certainly do everything to catch these monsters, who have committed a terrorist attack against ordinary people. What\'s more, a barbarous terrorist attack. We will do everything, so that they are found and punished in accordance with the law of our country, or in the case of resistance or other cases, so that they are eliminated."\nVilayat Galgaycho reportedly took responsibility, stating that the attack was aimed against "Ossetian infidels" on "occupied Ingush lands".\nThe majority of the civilians killed were Russians, but also foreigners from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Belarus, Germany, Austria, United Kingdom and Armenia were killed in terrorist attacks.\nNote: The casualty totals are compiled by the news site Caucasian Knot, which does not vouch for the data\'s 100-percent accuracy.\nTerrorist incidents\n2009 Nazran bombing\n2009 Nevsky Express bombing\\\n2010 Moscow Metro bombings\n2010 Kizlyar bombings\n2010 Stavropol bomb blast\n2010 Tsentoroy attack\n2010 Vladikavkaz bombing\n2010 Chechen Parliament attack\nDomodedovo International Airport bombing\n2012 Makhachkala attack\nOctober 2013 Volgograd bus bombing\nDecember 2013 Volgograd bombings\n2014 Grozny bombing\n2014 Grozny clashes\nMetrojet Flight 9268\n2017 Saint Petersburg Metro bombing\n2018 Kizlyar church shooting\nRussian Counterinsurgency: The Two Paradigms of Russian COIN\nRussian operations in the North Caucasus as well as Syria continue a long-running historical legacy while also allowing us to look at historical examples with new insights. Indeed, in Syria Russia has waged and is waging a combined arms campaign that strategically resembles the Russian approach to counterinsurgency. This tells us that Russia does not necessarily view COIN as a light forces campaign but it also should force observers to consider that approach as well as the Anglo-French approach so beloved of analysts and which has had, to be sure a checkered record.[1]\nCOIN is an integrated set of political, economic, social, and security measures intended to end and prevent the recurrence of armed violence, create and maintain stable political, economic, and social structures, and resolve the underlying causes of an insurgency in order to establish and sustain the conditions necessary for lasting stability.[2]\nThe current US Department of Defense definition of counterinsurgency reads as follows: “Those military, paramilitary, economic, psychological, and civic actions taken by a government to defeat insurgency.”[3]\nRussian history offers a rich palette of strategies, policies, and courses of action, available to rulers in conducting counterinsurgencies. There are clear “constant operating factors “ in Russian COIN which began with Ivan III’s takeover of Novgorod in 1478 after which he promptly deported the entire population This history reveals ongoing similarities in tactics and strategies, e.g. mass deportations to Siberia, or into serfdom, or in the case of the Circassians to Turkey in 1863, up through Stalin’s genocidal campaigns to the present Chechen war which depopulated the region. We may well regard the aspects of the Soviet civil war in the territories of the national minorities who rose up against Soviet imperialism and socialism (the two were the same to them) and many of the ensuing insurgencies after 1921, Basmachi, revolts in the North Caucasus, Ukraine, and Russia proper as continuation that civil war and as insurgencies. Thus the Soviet response well into the 1920s if not the 1930s resembled COIN or polices of imperial management.\nIndeed, despite enduring constant features and even though we are simplifying drastically for reasons of space, two discernible broad paradigms are discernible in Russia’s counterinsurgency history. Tsarist, Soviet, and post-Soviet authorities have frequently, though not always, successfully employed these paradigms. To some degree these paradigms are alternative strategies not usable simultaneously. Often where the first direct and often excessively brutal approach fails the second, more indirect, and socio-politically sophisticated paradigm replaces it. This does not preclude an overlap in the tactics employed in either or both of these paradigms, e.g. deportations and great brutality. Nonetheless we can analytically distinguish between these two paradigms, especially in the North Caucasus.\nThe first strategic paradigm is one of brutal suppression entailing a comprehensive direct assault on the enemy and his society. Examples of this approach abound: General Ermolov’s brutal assaults on the people and mores of the North Caucasus in 1816-25 and his successors’ similar assaults in the 1830-50s.[4] Other examples include the Tambov peasant insurgency in 1920-21 that General Mikhail Tukhachevsky brutally suppressed even using gas attacks on unarmed civilians and insurgents.[5]\nSubsequent examples are the “Khudzhum” of the 1920’s in Central Asia and its many episodes of “forced feminism”,[6] the collectivization struggle of 1929-33 and the overall revolution from above where whole communities and peoples were deported or, as in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, subjected to famine; and Stalin’s deportations of many nationalities, particularly in the North Caucasus in 1943-44.[7]\nOf course, even in some of these dramas, e.g. collectivization, there were retreats and periods of concessions to the “insurgents”. But in these wars the brutal direct attack on people and their way of life, is quite visible and the primary approach. And an ongoing characteristic of this approach is its disdain, contempt for, and ignorance of the native societies that resisted Russian attacks. In both Central Asia and the North Caucasus, if not the entire country, the evidence is overwhelming that a largely Russian party and governmental apparatus sought to suppress minority demands for advancement in the 1920s-30s, forcing the central government to intervene on behalf of policies aiming to enroot socialism among those minorities.[8] That could explain why this approach often failed. Yet given the primacy of the Silovye Struktury in current as well as past Russian policymaking we see a constant temptation to resort to just this paradigm despite its high cost and incidence of failure. In Syria we see this paradigm of direct and brutal assault in its contemporary manifestation of the brutal and unrelenting bombing and systematic destruction of Aleppo by Russian air forces with the clear intention of destroying the insurgency against Bashear Assad by force.[9] And in the North Caucasus Russian forces are distinguished by their brutality, resort to practices of the medieval tactic of collective surety, (Krugovaya Poruka), and large-scale criminality.[10] This paradigm’s continuity therefore represents a fifth form of resemblance between the present and the past.\nThe second paradigm’s cases reflect a more sophisticated understanding and employment of the measures needed to undermine the insurgents’ cohesion by splitting the movement and balancing concessions and appeals to indigenous values with repression. This strategy did not only make concessions to enemies’ way of life, nationality, and/or religion. It is quite consciously a strategy of imperial management, whose main component is to find those elites who would work with Moscow or St. Petersburg, install them in leadership positions, co-opt them and their followers into the cosmopolitan Russian ruling elite, make the requisite concessions to the people, and over the long term integrate these elites into the Russian state to deprive the population of a leadership stratum that could lead any future revolts.\nIn the Soviet case, for example, as Stalin repeatedly observed, the government simply had no cadres who could make socialism intelligible and/or legitimate to native Muslims and had to recruit from whomever it could find that would support them until such time as it could create or find reliable, i.e. truly Bolshevized, leaders.[11] As a result we see in the creation of Central Asian and the North Caucasus republics of the 1920s clear efforts to coopt modernizing elites who found Soviet socialism attractive or compelling as a political watchword for their societies and who could then lead others into discrete territorial and socio-political institutions that were loyal to Moscow.[12] Those policies of nativization (korenizatsiya) in the 1920s and the creation of North Caucasian autonomous political formations and of Central Asian union republics that gave elements of real political power and authority to native leaders along with seeming concessions to religious practices in the early NEP period (1921-25) clearly represented elements of his strategy and a conscious desire to coopt willing elites.[13] In the contemporary case, the promotion of Akhmad Kadyrov, who was the Grand Mufti of Chechnya before throwing in with Moscow in 2000 and then becoming president of Chechnya, and then his son Ramzan Kadyrov who succeeded him after he was assassinated in 2004, embody the continuation and success of this strategy of coopting elites in a contemporary guise and is a sixth example of continuity.\nAlternatively Moscow would designate a favored social category and support them at the expense of less favored groups and thereby restructure the local society. The attempts to discover and promote promising Central Asians after the mid-1920s clearly represented this element or branch of this “second” paradigm. Throughout the history of successful imperial advances Russia could rely quite successfully on these elites who form a pro-Russian party amidst targeted territories, peoples, and states.[14]\nBut this strategy, as Rieber has observed, also epitomized Stalin’s approach at home in the initial Soviet period but also a generation later when he built his external empire in Eastern Europe. Specifically he recurrently aimed to create a pro-Russian party in the Russian borderlands or outside them who could be reliably counted on to advance the regime’s aims and weaken the cohesion of opposing domestic and external forces. And his foreign policies, as Rieber notes, grew directly out of his experiences in 1917-29 in dealing with the “national question.”[15] Combined with overwhelming force and Moscow’s ability - a common operational thread in all its ventures – to isolate the theater from foreign support, this blending of force and cooptation has generally succeeded in advancing Russian imperial objectives, most recently in Syria and in Chechnya.\nOf course the reality is not distinct paradigms but their interaction over time. Indeed, in both the contemporary and historical cases alike we see not so much analytically distinct paradigms but their interaction or the existence of elements of both paradigms at one and the same time. Stalin epitomizes this reality in his own policies that combined at different times terrifying force and sophisticated strategies of cooptation. But in factcooptation always relied on the presence and understanding of immense force in reserve to back it up and at home to isolate troubled regions from foreign intervention.\nSince our main concern here is with the historical success of this second paradigm (albeit backed up by a great deal of force and repression) it deserves fuller explication. Generally this approach comes into play when it becomes clear that the direct and more brutal policy has failed and that something else must be tried. It is not only a question of making concessions to minorities’ way of life, nationality, and/or religion. It is quite consciously a strategy of imperial management, whose main component is to find those elites who are willing to work with Moscow or St. Petersburg, install them in leadership positions, co-opt them and their followers into the Russian ruling elite which always was a cosmopolitan affair, make the requisite concessions to the people, and over the long term integrate these elites into the Russian state thus depriving the population of a leadership stratum with which to lead any future revolts. Throughout the history of successful Russian imperial advances we find Moscow and/or St. Petersburg being able to rely quite successfully on these elites who form a pro-Russian party amidst targeted territories, peoples, and states.[16]\nIn Syria Moscow had a ready-made pool of support in the remnants of the Syrian Army and the state that understood that if Assad lost they faced death or exile, which makes the Syrian case something of an outlier in this respect. But we see in Central Asia and the North Caucasus in the 1920s and again more recently in Chechnya that once the regime grasped that direct assault on those societies was counter-productive and not effective in creating a reliable and/or loyal Soviet cadre it focused on working with local elites who could be cooperated.\nIsrael\nContrary to popular belief, conventional armies can indeed defeat terrorist insurgencies. This study will detail the six basic conditions which, if met, enable an army to fight and win the war against terrorism, among which are control of the ground where the insurgency is being waged, acquiring relevant intelligence for operations against the terrorists themselves, and isolating the insurgency from cross-border reinforcement with manpower or material. It will also examine the factors that can help drive a wedge between the local population and the insurgent forces seeking its support. The principles of war will also be analyzed in terms of their applicability to asymmetric warfare to show how they still serve as a vital guide for armies in vanquishing terror. Finally, the study warns that if the U.S., Israel, or their Western allies incorrectly conclude that they have no real military option against terrorist insurgencies – out of a fear that these conflicts inevitably result in an unwinnable quagmire – then the war on terrorism will be lost even before it is fully waged.\nPart I: Can a Conventional Army Vanquish a Terrorist Insurgency?\nThe urgency of designing a winning strategy for waging counterinsurgency warfare has clearly arisen in the aftermath of the 2003 Iraq War and with the post-9/11 War on Terrorism, more generally. These low-intensity conflicts are not new in the history of warfare. The U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual reminds its readers that “insurgency and its tactics are as old as warfare itself.”\n1. One author dates the first guerrilla campaign from the Spanish rebellion in 1808 against Napoleon’s French forces.\n2.But today, these smaller wars have suddenly become more prominent, especially after the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the huge Soviet conventional armored threat to Central Europe. The approach of the Western alliance toward limited counterinsurgency wars has been, on the whole, very negative. This might be due to the experience of the U.S. Army in Vietnam. Decisive victories, like the Second World War, seem harder to achieve, despite the enormous firepower the U.S. could employ in such conflicts. Western withdrawals from Lebanon (1983) and Somalia (1993) in the face of terrorist attacks only reinforced this perception.\nConsequently, the term “unwinnable war” became increasingly associated with a variety of counterinsurgency campaigns. In 1992, Bush administration [41] officials pursued a hands-off policy on Bosnia, describing it as “an unwinnable situation for the military.”\n3.After 9/11, even the former commander of NATO Forces in Europe, General Wesley Clark, told the Daily Telegraph that America, Britain, and their allies could become embroiled in an unwinnable guerrilla war in Afghanistan.\n4 Underlying all these analyses is the assumption that counterinsurgency campaigns necessarily turn into protracted conflicts that will inevitably lose political support.\nMore recently in 2005, Foreign Affairs carried an article by a Rand analyst who called the Iraq War “unwinnable” and suggested that the U.S. eliminate its military presence, and rally Iran and the Europeans to help. The “Iraq Study Group,” chaired by former Secretary of State James Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton, did not go this far, though it suggested in 2006 that the situation in Iraq was “grave and deteriorating” and hence looked to pull U.S. military involvement back to a “supporting” role alone for the Iraq Army.\n5 If Western policy-makers conclude as a result of U.S. military engagements in Afghanistan and in Iraq that the U.S. and its allies have no military option against worldwide insurgencies launched by international terrorist groups, then the War on Terrorism will be lost even before it is fully waged.\nRecent military progress by U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq have begun to counter much of the previous analyses that view counterinsurgency warfare as an inevitably hopeless quagmire that will bog down any Western army which engages in such a mission. During October 2007, the new commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, an authority on counterinsurgency warfare, managed to cut monthly U.S. fatalities to a third of what they were a year earlier. Attacks in the Sunni-dominated Anbar Province fell from around 1,300 a month in October 2006 to under 100 in November 2007.\n6 There were over two hundred fatalities per month from car bomb attacks alone in the Baghdad area in early 2007, yet by November and December that number fell dramatically to around a dozen fatalities per month.\n7 These results did not constitute a decisive military victory, for U.S. commanders were the first to admit that al-Qaeda had not been defeated.\n8 But the results certainly indicated that a counterinsurgency campaign was not a hopeless undertaking.\nThis monograph demonstrates that, contrary to popular belief, military forces can indeed defeat terrorism by adopting an alternative concept of victory, called “sufficient victory.”The Economist tried to develop a similar concept of its own in this regard: “‘Victory’ for the West is not going in either place [Afghanistan and Iraq] to entail a surrender ceremony and a parade.”\n9 At best, the Economist suggests that the West can look forward to “a tapering off of violence.”\n10 As such, terror is not completely destroyed but is contained at a minimal level, with constant investment of energy in order to prevent its eruption.\nThis analysis will first define key terms: insurgency, terror, and various types of victory. It will then detail the six basic conditions which, if met, enable an army to fight and win the war against terrorism:\nThe decision of the political echelon to defeat terrorism and to bear the political cost of an offensive.\nControl of the territory from which the terrorists operate.\nRelevant intelligence.\nIsolating the territory within which counterterrorist operations are taking place.\nMulti-dimensional cooperation between intelligence and operations.\nSeparating the civilian population that has no connection with terrorism from the terrorist entities.\nAs several of these conditions indicate, counterinsurgency strategies already have a strong political dimension, for they involve the loyalties and well-being of the civilian population where the war is being conducted. But as the analysis will explain, the preferences of the civilian population will be primarily affected by conditions on the ground where they live and not by political arrangements negotiated between diplomats in distant capitals, far from the battlefield. The U.S. Counterinsurgency Field Manual also concludes that “citizens seek to ally with groups that can guarantee their safety.”\n11. This can be achieved when the political leadership in the insurgency area is willing to take responsibility and stand up to the pressures of the terrorist organizations and even fight them.\nIndeed, Gen. Petraeus’ breakthrough in Anbar Province came about because of the decisions of local Sunni tribal leaders in western Iraq about how to best protect their security and not through the detailed efforts to work out a more perfect Iraqi constitution in Baghdad, which had been the focus of coalition political efforts previously. Indeed, this lesson is applicable to other conflict zones, particularly where the central government’s authority is weak and lacks the capacity to substantially change the security situation on the ground, as in southern Lebanon or even among the Palestinians, as well.\nFinally, the monograph analyzes the principles of war in terms of their applicability to asymmetric warfare – essentially the war against terrorist and guerrilla organizations – and shows how these principles still serve as a vital guide for armies in vanquishing terror.\nThe adoption of two erroneous assumptions – that terror is more determined and resilient than the democratic state and that victory is always a matter of the mind and not a product of coercive physical measures – has induced many to believe that there is no military method to cope with terror in order to vanquish it. These kinds of assertions have become more common in much of the discourse concerning Israel’s war with Hizbullah in 2006 and the war of the U.S.-led coalition against insurgent forces in Iraq. History – even the history of the State of Israel – proves that this contention is seriously mistaken.\nThe Military’s Mistake\nI would not be writing this article had I not heard from a student at the Israel Defense Forces Staff and Command College that some of the lecturers who speak before Israeli officers have asserted that “an army cannot vanquish terror” and that “only a political process can bring about a cessation of terror.”The student’s understanding was that since it was axiomatic that a conventional army could never win a guerrilla war, therefore in every possible encounter between an army and a terrorist organization, the army could not hope to achieve victory. The student clearly applied this principle to the struggle between the IDF and Palestinian terror.\nIt seemed that in their classes these students had not heard from their lecturers the historical cases in which Western armies had actually defeated insurgent forces in difficult guerrilla campaigns. The U.S. Army was twice involved in successful counterinsurgency campaigns in the Philippines (from 1899 to 1902, and between 1946 and 1954). Additionally, the British Army won a tough counterinsurgency war in Malaya between 1952 and 1957. In the Middle East, the British also waged successful counterinsurgency campaigns during the 1930s in British Mandatory Palestine and decades later in the 1970s in Dhofar Province in Oman. I cannot help but imagine that some of these very same lecturers are cloaking their lack of understanding for the sphere of war in general, and the war against terror in particular, with mellifluous words and pseudoscientific arguments. Theirs is an argument that historical experience clearly refutes!\nThe “inability” argument is frequently put forward in unprofessional language that creates a new terminology, unintelligible to everybody. This, in turn, facilitates the avoidance of genuine clarification of that which is being discussed and of the actual situation.\n12 When did this tainted phenomenon mature in our midst, giving rise to a situation in which some military men prefer to evade their obligation and responsibility to vanquish terror, passing the buck to the statesmen? This is not purely a question of abstract philosophy, but one that carries great practical significance. In its light, elected officials, who are left without any military option against terror, must either flee a confrontation with terror or submit to its demands. If this should become the case, then Israel’s security would likely slowly deteriorate, exactly as those who pursue terror expect. Here I will seek to elucidate that an army can emerge victorious over terror – on condition that it is made clear what exactly is meant by “victory” and the practical results that can be expected from the army in the context of such a victory.\nIn order to conduct a fruitful discussion, it is necessary to accurately define all the components of the problem, namely: what is an “army” in the context of fighting terror, what precisely does the term “victory” mean, and what sort of “terror” are we dealing with?\nDefining the Essential Terms\nArmy\nAn “army,” in this case, is not merely the “armed forces.” In addition to the security organizations, it also comprises especially the intelligence community in its broader sense. In the particular case of the State of Israel, the question is not whether the IDF can vanquish terror, but whether the general array of the IDF, the Israel Security Agency (ISA), the Mossad, the police, and the national economic and financial bodies that function together in a well-coordinated effort can vanquish terror. Thus, anybody examining whether the IDF, which is the only body defined as an “army,” can, by itself, vanquish terror will have to respond in the negative.\nInsurgency and Terror\nInsurgency is the general term for many types of asymmetric warfare, including terrorism. The U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual uses the definition of an insurgency as “an organized movement aimed at the overthrow of a constituted government through the use of subversion and armed conflict.” It is a “politico-military” struggle, according to the Field Manual, “designed to weaken the control and legitimacy of an established government, occupying power, or other political authority while increasing insurgent control.”\nThere clearly have been many types of insurgencies in world history with a wide variety of politico-military goals, including independence movements against colonial powers and Marxist revolutionary movements against nationalist regimes. The Arab Revolt was an insurgency against the Ottoman Empire during the First World War and provided another example of a nationalist insurgency which encouraged the breakup of a multinational empire. Today, there is a rising threat of Islamist insurgencies that have adopted the tactics of “terror,” as described below. The current Islamist insurgencies have far-reaching politico-military goals of eliminating Israel, toppling pro-Western Arab regimes, and spreading radical Islam worldwide in order to re-establish the Caliphate.\nThe current Islamist insurgencies have far-reaching politico-military goals of eliminating Israel, toppling pro-Western Arab regimes, and spreading radical Islam worldwide in order to re-establish the Caliphate.\n“Terror” is thus a subset of insurgency warfare. The concept “terror” encompasses four types of terror, but all employ deliberate violence against civilians in order to obtain political, religious, national, or ideological objectives:\nInternal terror of the anarchistic variant that operates against an existing regime.\nCross-border terror of the type waged from Jordan by the PLO against the IDF in the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) during the 1960s; the war waged by Hizbullah from southern Lebanon and presently by the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip against Israel.\nInternational terror of the al-Qaeda variant, which found expression in the attack on the World Trade Center in New York, the attacks in London, the firing of an antiaircraft missile at an El Al airplane in Kenya, and the attacks in Istanbul. Hizbullah also engaged in international terrorism at least twice in Argentina and in Thailand.\nTerror waged by someone who contends to be fighting against an occupier, such as the Palestinian terror in the West Bank or that of the Iraqis against the Americans in Iraq; namely, terror that is carried out against a state whose military forces are situated in the area where the terror is perpetrated.\nThis discussion deals exclusively with the question of the feasibility of vanquishing terror that is operating in an area that is at least nominally controlled by the military forces of the state combating the terror – the fourth type. However, in many cases, the various types of terror intermingle. Some of the conclusions are applicable to combating other types, especially that of cross-border terror.\nVictory\nWhat type of victory is to be achieved? The answer to this question should serve as the focus of discussion regarding the army’s mission and its part in annihilating terror. The military concept of “victory” is more familiar from the realm of conventional warfare, where the enemy is defeated, destroyed, or deprived of its ability to continue the war, even if it should so desire.\nMilitary victory can frequently also influence the will of the state whose army has been defeated, causing it to cease thinking in terms of the resumed use of military force. However, this objective is not a prerequisite for the current definition. During the latter half of the twentieth century the “total victory” model of the Second World War was assimilated as part of military doctrine. What characterized the close of that war was that, following the destruction of the German army and the military conquest of Germany, and following Japan’s surrender and conquest after the U.S. dropped atomic bombs, the Allies controlled both countries. During the years of the U.S. presence in Berlin and Tokyo, it erected new regimes that were totally different from the predecessor regimes in both countries. This was total victory, based on military victory, which transformed two fanatic and militaristic countries into avowedly peace-loving regimes.\nThis is not the sole model of victory recognized by history. For example, the defeat of Germany in the First World War was completely different. As proof of the matter, Germany embarked on another great war twenty-one years later. Such was also the case of the defeat of Egypt and Syria in the Six-Day War. Six years after that victory the two again attacked Israel. These precedents will better enable us to define the military victory required against terror and in guerrilla warfare.\nOne can speak of three levels of victory:\nTotal Victory – Total victory eliminates the terrorist organizations and guerrilla groups and their demands from the political and global map, and no one except those victimized by the terror recalls that it was ever part of reality. Such, for example, occurred in the defeat of Communist guerrillas in Greece after the Second World War. Paying a bloody price, the Greek army, aided by the British, managed to liquidate the terror movement. Once that war was concluded, Greece no longer faced a Communist threat. The result of the fighting against rebels in Oman during the Dhofar rebellion between 1965 and 1975 was similar: the Sultan, whose son today rules that Persian Gulf country, managed with British aid to liquidate the rebels, who received assistance from neighboring countries. If a revolt were to take place in the sultanate, it would not be related to the terror movements, which were totally destroyed more than thirty years ago. The Palestinian terror against the British and the Jews in 1936, as well as the Palestinian terror in Jordan in 1970, were both completely uprooted by force and did not return to threaten the British Mandatory government in Palestine or the Hashemite regime in Jordan.\nTemporary Victory – This was the case in the victory over Palestinian terror in Gaza in the beginning of the 1970s, when Ariel Sharon was commander of the IDF Southern Command. After the dismantling of the terror in Gaza, the IDF reduced the size of the forces that controlled the Gaza Strip to isolated units, and Israelis could circulate there almost without trepidation. The terror did indeed return to Gaza, but it was after fifteen years of quiet, with the new terror essentially different from its predecessor.\nSufficient Victory – This is a victory that does not produce many years of tranquility, but rather achieves only a “repressed quiet,” requiring the investment of continuous effort to preserve it. The terror is not destroyed but is contained at a minimal level, with constant efforts to prevent its eruption. For many years, this was the achievement of the British in Northern Ireland and the Spanish against the Basques. This was also the achievement of Israel in the West Bank in the aftermath of the 2002 Operation Defensive Shield.\nTemporary victory and sufficient victory do not provide a solution to the ideological conflict that forms the basis of the armed struggle and terror. As long as any reason whatsoever exists – political, national, ethnic, economic, religious, ideological, or an amalgam of all these – that facilitates the recruitment of people to the terror movements, and as long as there is an active hardcore that has an interest in prolonging terror, one must expect terror to continue or to be renewed. A military effort cannot be expected to solve a problem of historical dimensions. As long as some of the terror bodies have escaped liquidation, then a complete and total solution to such a conflict can in principle be provided solely by a political solution. Nonetheless, one must reemphasize: a political solution is not the affair of the army, and efforts to obtain it cannot be divorced from the obligation to fight determinedly against any attempt by the enemy to secure achievements through violence, as in the case of the present attempt by the Palestinians to make political gains through terror.\nThe distinction between these two levels of addressing a problem must be clear: a solution to the conflict lies in the hands of the statesmen. However, the army – and only the army – is the relevant party as long as there is no such solution, and it bears responsibility to check the violent aspect of the conflict.\nPart of the widespread misinterpretation in certain circles is caused by confusion between terror and ideological conflict. Since the army does not possess the tools to contend with the latter, people draw the conclusion that “there is no military solution.” In general, as stated, the army is expected to address only the violent aspect of the conflict, which is terror, and is not expected to discover a solution or to fight in order to find an exit strategy from the conflict in toto. It would be preferable if the army would not term the fight against terror a “limited conflict,” but rather employ its proper name, “war on terrorism,” in the literal sense. The semantic change would perhaps help the army comprehend that it is obligated to combat terrorism without any excuses, and not engage in the political dimensions of a conflict which should be left to the civilian echelon.\nOf course, in the general framework of such fighting, one must address aspects of psychological warfare, contend with the financing of terror, and incorporate other non-violent aspects that supplement military activities. However, these supplementary activities are performed with the goal of impairing the ability of the terror bodies to carry out their plans and not within the political dimension of solving the dispute in general.\nIt clearly emerges from the foregoing that as long as the conflict that led to the eruption of terror is still in full force, the army’s fundamental objective is to destroy the capability of the other side to employ terror, irrespective of whether this takes a one-time effort or whether it will require continued activity over the course of years. This objective is crystal clear and is of a military nature by any professional yardstick. However, it cannot be obtained if those who are expected to execute the task are using vague concepts such as “attrition,” “cognition,” “effects,” and other terms that permit one to argue that terror cannot be destroyed.\n“Sufficient victory,” namely, that which can contain and check terror a moment before it strikes, becomes more significant if, due to continuous frustration by the army of the terror organizations’ efforts to attack, the terrorists decide – consciously or otherwise – to reduce the number of their terror attempts. This situation would mean “victory” on a much higher plane, because it signifies that not only has the terrorists’ implementation capability been impaired, but also their ability to pass from intention to action. Such an achievement is possible, for example, when the terror bodies are too busy protecting their own lives to plan terror and carry it out or when internal opinion turns against them and prevents them – directly or indirectly – from carrying out their intentions.\nDefense measures that interdict terror, including the securing of possible targets, can seriously handicap the terrorists’ ability to carry out their intention. However, only by attacking the terror organizations in their lairs and mobilization points, before they set out to implement their plans, can one cause a decline in their operational ability.\n13. The implementation of a terror attack is a complicated process involving the participation of many bodies, beginning with the preachers and recruiters and ending with those who press the trigger or the detonator switch on explosive belts. Striking any one of these factors – as early as possible – yields not only an increase in the number of interdictions, but also a reduction in the number of attempts by the terror organizations. Such a triumph, while it does not incorporate a crushing and rapid victory, still constitutes an achievement and should be defined as such.\nA military victory is measured in the classic wars of maneuver, inter alia, by the number of casualties inflicted on the enemy in manpower and equipment. In the war on terrorism, by contrast, the IDF’s achievement is measured by criteria that are not clearly military, such as the degree of security and tranquility. This tranquility finds expression in civilian measures as well, such as indices of economic growth.\nA study of the strategy that was intended to subdue Israel, authored and openly disseminated by the terror perpetrators, informs us that the bulk of their efforts, which are indeed heinous but limited in comparison to a general war, are devoted to crippling the morale of Israel’s citizens. The plan is for this type of blow to constrict immigration, arrest tourism, cut foreign investment to a trickle, and cause capital flight abroad. All this would result in negative economic growth, mass despair, and emigration until Israel disintegrates from within.\nAn examination of these indices in March 2002 demonstrates that some of these objectives were indeed realized in practice, and the terror perpetrators were on the brink of attainment with regard to the others. Did this represent a professional failure on the part of military men, who did not comprehend their mission and did not properly evaluate the situation, or was it a failure of the political echelon that refrained from using the army? It would be wise to investigate and understand this issue. However, what is important is the outcome that emerges from repeated historical lessons: an army, if it acts properly, can prevent terror and win the war against it.\nOperation Defensive Shield (April 2002)\nThe situation that prevailed in the West Bank after Operation “Defensive Shield” (April 2002) is an excellent example of how terror can be vanquished with military force – at least at the third level of victory, namely, to destroy the enemy’s capabilities through a continuous effort and without solving the conflict. Israel went to war after it counted 132 dead, all of them civilians, in the preceding month (meaning the equivalent of more than 1,500 deaths a year). In a continuous and uninterrupted effort following that campaign, Israel’s terror casualty rate declined to 11 civilians for all of 2006, which mathematically speaking was less than 1 percent of the 2002 figure. In 2007, Israeli civilian casualties from terrorism originating in the West Bank fell even further. In practical terms, Israel was clearly victorious in repressing terrorism. This is true even if the Palestinians’ effort to renew their terrorist attacks and their dream of killing Jews inside Israeli territory remained as strong as ever. It was an outstanding victory – the type of victory over terror that one can demand of the army.\nOf course, from the army’s standpoint, even 11 people murdered annually by terror constitutes an unacceptable number, and the utmost must be done to reduce it to zero. Yet there is no doubt that such a figure, and the commensurate relative tranquility and prosperity it affords Israel, represents a genuine failure for terrorism. Indeed, we see that those who pressed to allow the IDF military freedom of action at a time when its hands were tied, and who penned the slogan “Let the IDF Win,” were correct. When the government allowed the IDF to act, it actually did win.\nNonetheless, there is no doubt that a decision on the battlefield does not reflect the entire picture. The story is told of the American officer who met a North Vietnamese general and told him: “You know, we examined all our battles in Vietnam and it turned out that we subdued the South Vietnamese guerrilla movement and we liquidated all the guerrilla forces that had penetrated from the North.”The North Vietnamese responded to him: “That is correct, but why is it relevant?”\nAn important truth is concealed in this response, pertinent to relations between the political and military echelons. The outcome on the battlefield should lead the political bodies to understand that the situation permits them to withstand the demands of the terror organizations. If they still elect for one reason or another to compromise, surrender, withdraw, or concede, then all the work invested by the military echelon is in vain. In other words, it is possible that a victory over terror may not lead to an improved political situation. This is one area where classic warfare, on the model of the Second World War, differs from the type of warfare we are discussing. Therefore, the burden imposed on civilian decision-makers in this type of war is more onerous.\nPrecisely because of this, civilian directives to the military must be precise and detailed in order to serve the political objective more accurately. This political objective must also be stated as clearly as possible by the political echelon. Israel learned this again from its experience in the Second Lebanon War.\nRegardless, the political echelon’s difficulty in exploiting a victory over terror cannot serve as an excuse for the military to abandon the quest for military victory.\nDetermination\nThe late Colonel Shmuel Nir (Samu), who served as divisional intelligence officer in the Northern Command at the time I was intelligence officer for the command, wrote an article that laid the basis for the concept of “attrition” instead of “victory.”While meritorious in some ways, his argument contains a serious, fundamental flaw. Samu analyzes the components of power wielded by our antagonists in the conflict and determines, correctly, that we are dealing not only with physical power, but with the reciprocal relations between resources, capabilities, and determination. In his discussion of determination, he contends – without proving his argument – that “the principal advantage of the inferior side is in the determination component, which expresses itself in a national power of perseverance and an ability to absorb punishment in the face of foreseeable or possible losses and destruction.”\n14.The facts demonstrate otherwise. It has never been proven that terror organizations possess greater resilience than the community of democratic peoples; it has never been proven that terror organizations are prepared to sacrifice more than are their victims; and it has never been proven that the society from which terror emanates is prepared to absorb greater anticipated destruction than those fighting terror. It was bin Laden who proposed a cease-fire to the United States, rather than the United States to bin Laden. So who has greater resilience? Did not Israeli society demonstrate as much resilience as its enemies during the course of the terror war that took place between November 1947 and May 1948, in which Israel absorbed 1,200 dead, or in the war beginning in September 2000, in which Israel sustained 1,400 killed? Since a state that is fighting terror generally employs greater resources and capabilities than the terror organization it is confronting, and since the state is not inferior to the terror organization in resilience, Samu’s argument regarding the advantage of terror in the general correlation of forces stands refuted.\nSamu also presents the idea that “victory is a matter of society’s cognizance.”Thus, it is argued that Israel did not depart Lebanon because the IDF was defeated in the fighting, but because the cognizance of Israeli society had shifted due to guerrilla pressure and the cost in blood, which appeared excessive (in the last 17 months of Israel’s presence in southern Lebanon, Israel suffered 21 dead).\nSuccess on the battlefield led to the destruction of Communist terror’s capability in Greece without a change in anyone’s cognizance. The same applies to the present situation in the West Bank. The current tranquility was achieved not because someone changed his cognition about the other side, but because the IDF and the Israel Security Agency almost completely liquidated the terror organizations’ capacity for action. Quite a few surveys, as well as the Palestinian elections, point to the fact that nothing has changed in Palestinian cognizance, but the statistics demonstrate that terror has been greatly reduced there.\nThe fact that Israel did not withdraw from Gaza under the pressure of terror did not change a thing. When we are dealing with cognizance and image, reality is not the determining factor.What matters is the way Israel’s actions are perceived by the Palestinians.\nTrue, this is a “third-level victory,” namely, the type that requires constant effort to preserve the achievement, and it is also true that sometimes the terror organizations manage to act and kill. Nonetheless, given the assumption that the IDF will continue to bring down the level of terror, it is clear that from the perspective of terror and its objective to undermine the Israeli way of life, terror has been a total failure. It is possible that if Israel had not withdrawn from Gaza, thus allowing the terror organizations to claim “victory,” then the result of the war on terrorism would have been even clearer. The fact that Israel did not withdraw from Gaza under the pressure of terror did not change a thing. When we are dealing with cognizance and image, reality is not the determining factor. What matters is the way Israel’s actions are perceived by the Palestinians. When Israel kills or arrests the terror perpetrators (and from a professional standpoint, it is preferable to arrest), this is not a “victory of cognizance,” but a small step on a long road to victory in practice in a real physical sense. When the age of the terror operatives drops from the late 20s to the late teens, it appears that we are dealing with a “bottomless pit,” while the truth is that we have a real, concrete achievement. The replacement generation is younger, with less experience than its predecessor, and it does not have the same ability to direct, recruit, and lead. This is compounded by a sense of persecution stemming from the arrest and destruction of their predecessors and from the clear awareness that their lives are similarly at risk, with only a matter of time until they become a target. The new generation is also more cautious and preoccupied with escape, and hence produces less terror and definitely less qualitative and dangerous terror.\nThe adoption of these two mistaken assumptions – that terrorists are more determined and resilient than democratic states and that victory is always a matter of cognizance rather than the outcome of physical and coercive measures – has induced many to believe that there is no military approach for contending with terror in order to defeat it.\nThis confusion could have been prevented had it been understood that no one expects a military body to solve an ideological conflict and that even military “victory” signifies various levels of achievement, where the first requirement of victory is to check terror in a physical manner and not to alter the enemy’s political perceptions. In the long run, the military failure of terrorist organizations might lead them to alter their ideology, but that cannot be the mission of the military that should be focused on the capabilities of its adversary and not its intentions.\nPart II: The Conditions Necessary for Winning the War Against Terrorism\nSix Basic Conditions\nAn examination of many terrorist events throughout the world (but especially the Israeli experience in fighting Palestinian and Hizbullah terrorism) shows that six basic conditions can be defined which, if met, provide the foundation for defeating terrorism:\nSix basic conditions can be defined which, if met, provide the foundation for defeating terrorism. They do not ensure victory over terrorism, but without them victory is impossible.\nA political decision to defeat terrorism, stated explicitly and clearly to the security forces, and the willingness to bear the political cost of an offensive.\nAcquiring control of the territory in and from which the terrorists operate.\nRelevant intelligence.\nIsolating the territory within which the counterterrorist fighting takes place.\nMulti-dimensional cooperation between intelligence and operations.\nSeparating the civilian population from the terrorists.\nThese conditions are necessary but insufficient; they do not ensure victory over terrorism, but without them victory is impossible.\nClausewitz was right when he said that “war has its own grammar.” Even the most chaotic human situation, which seems to be an endless collection of individual, illogical, unconnected incidents – namely, war – has basic rules. A country can decide against going to war, but if it chooses warfare, it must act according to war’s basic principles. Ignoring them will prove futile; unless they are genuinely addressed, that war cannot be won. The war on terrorism is a particular case, thus all the “grammar rules” of ordinary war influence it in their own particular way, at varying degrees of intensity, and with emphases different from those of classic war. However, they all do have influence. Furthermore, the war on terrorism utilizes additional principles that complement those of ordinary war rather than negate them. This section will attempt to reveal these principles as necessary but insufficient preconditions for defeating terrorism.\nBy “victory” we refer to the third type mentioned above, namely, “sufficient victory,” which does not lead to many years of quiet but rather results in smothering the flames of the insurgency; it is maintained only at the cost of continual effort. Terrorist groups are not destroyed but become unable to act, and continuous counterterrorist measures have to be undertaken to prevent the renewal of attacks. A condition for coping with terrorism is understanding that the battle is long and that, even after success, continuing to suppress it demands ongoing, long-term effort, a great deal of hard work, the lives of soldiers, and patience. The basis for every political or military decision (important for every state that decides to fight terrorism and not to surrender to it) is the understanding that there are no easy solutions. No solution is absolute, and no success sufficient to say “finis” to terrorism. The steadfastness of the populace fighting terrorism is no less important than the success of the army sent to do combat.\nThe Conditions and Their Importance\n1. A Clear Political Decision by the political echelon to defeat terrorism and the willingness to bear the political cost of an offensive military policy. Since in many cases terrorism seems unbearable and extremely difficult to overcome, political leaders and even military commanders hesitate to define the objective of the war on terrorism as “defeating and ending terrorism.” Many prefer to define the objective as “reducing terrorism,””preventing terrorism,” or “forestalling terrorism,” or to use indirect expressions such as “reducing it to a level that enables the population to lead a normal life,” or “containing it so that it will not rend the fabric of life.” Such murky definitions lead to a kind of laxity that avoids the decisive use of force and makes it possible to cover up the failure of the war on terrorism. “Reduction” and even “forestalling” are terms that are both unclear and cannot be measured, to say nothing of definitions relating to indirect results given in completely undefined social terms.\nThe “defeat” demanded by the politicians can be reduced to a sufficient victory, as explained above, but from a military point of view the objective is perfectly clear: to prevent terrorist operatives from bringing their plans to fruition, despite their unrelenting desire and continued efforts to do so. Thus it is clear that every terrorist event is a failure for the army, which is not true regarding terrorism’s political and public successes, which are not the army’s business and with which it has to cope only marginally.\nEvery civilian leadership that has not resolutely defined the objective is directly responsible for the failure of the war on terrorism. It is clear, however, that a precise definition demands a focused force, and therefore precise military definitions of the force’s objectives are the responsibility of the senior military command, authorized at the political level. Implementation must be based on the understanding that military measures (and paramilitary ones, such as confiscating funds and blocking financial conduits) are meant to influence the operational aspect of terrorism, that is, the use of force. At the same time, the political level should deal with the other aspects, such as the political isolation of a terrorist organization or ensuring that proper international legislation is passed legitimizing the war on terrorism.\nThere must be a clear political decision by the political echelon to defeat terrorism and the willingness to bear the political cost of an offensive military policy.\nA more salient example of the failure caused by incorrectly defining an objective occurred in Lebanon between 1985 and 2000. During those years the government did not instruct the army to destroy Hizbullah’s ability to attack Israel and the IDF. When, in the middle of 1986, General Yossi Peled arrived at the Northern Command, he found no objective had been set that could be translated into a clear military mission, so he defined one himself as “quiet for the civilians in the north.” At the time it seemed an excellent definition to this writer as well, who served as intelligence officer for the Northern Command between 1986 and 1989. In retrospect, I think it was incorrect. It never related to the proper objective, i.e., destroying Hizbullah’s ability to attack Israel and the IDF. If there is no well-defined objective, the army cannot strike terrorism a mortal blow. Worse, every action was measured by the wrong standard: did it provide more or less “quiet for the civilians in the north?” The correct question should have been, “Did it bring us closer to the genuine objective of destroying Hizbullah’s capabilities?” If the answer was affirmative, the action should have been carried out while looking for ways to reduce attacks on the civilians in the north. We turned the secondary factor, reduction, into the objective and by so doing crippled our ability to wage war against Hizbullah correctly until we withdrew in 2000.\nIt is the military’s responsibility to make it absolutely clear to the politicians that it is impossible to defeat terrorism solely by defensive methods, and the politicians must completely understand that the war on terrorism has a political price. Experience has shown that the international community is not always prepared to legitimize an attack – and that is the nature of fighting terrorism – in the presence of civilians who are not terrorists and who run a high risk of being harmed. Whoever is unwilling to pay the price would do better not to think about achieving the aforementioned objective because, as noted, defensive measures are insufficient. The question of dividing energy between offense and defense will arise during the war on terrorism, but victory will be possible only if (and sometime primarily because) a policy of assault is pursued.\nDefining the objective and understanding that it will be necessary to attack and thus endanger the lives of innocent civilians are both essential for the success of every action soldiers take against terrorist and guerrilla forces.\n2. Controlling the Territory. The practical importance of control is first clearly functional and is manifested by the ability to operate in the relevant territory with small forces and heeding strictly military considerations without political limitations. In practical terms, this means that when it is necessary, military forces must be located in areas where terrorism is active, for example, where intelligence information indicates terrorists are organizing. If the commander in the field can make a decision based on his own considerations, without needing to pursue a (usually lengthy) process of obtaining political authorization to respond, the important advantage of controlling the territory can be seen in the context of fighting terrorism. The objective is for a small force (squad or company) commanded by a junior officer and without armored vehicles (APCs or tanks) to arrive quickly at any location to utilize the information, detain suspects, or destroy weapons or infrastructure. To achieve that end, the territory must first be subjugated and then controlled. This requires the use of a large force to locate, detain, and destroy the terrorist apparatus and its personnel, so that no terrorists or guerrillas can threaten the force operating there. Achieving control is a long process that can last days and, in difficult situations, even months.\nThe objective is for a small force commanded by a junior officer and without armored vehicles to arrive quickly at any location to utilize the information, detain suspects, or destroy weapons or infrastructure.\nThe second factor defining control of a territory is the ability to check the movement of the populace from which the terrorists emerge to attack and into which they subsequently disappear. Checking the movement of the populace denotes that the force fighting terrorism deploys roadblocks through which the populace and their possessions pass for inspection. These can be permanent or temporary, depending on the security situation and intelligence information as evaluated by the commander in charge, whose main considerations are security and the requirements of fighting terrorism.\nTwo aspects of the classic control of a territory are not relevant here. It is not necessary to deploy on relatively high ground in enemy territory, but rather, after a determined and sometimes long war, to be able to clear the territory of “serious” terrorist elements and activists until there is no threat to the force fighting terrorism. Second, once the territory is under control, there is no need for forces to be permanently deployed within urban or densely populated areas. The forces fighting terrorism can be deployed along access roads and on the outskirts of inhabited areas, so as to allow for a rapid response inside the territory or the immediate sealing of roads, in accordance with the special needs of fighting within a specific location.\nOver the past years in Israel we have experienced all the stages of fighting terrorism in an abridged but clear way: until the outbreak of the first intifada in 1987, Israel controlled the territories with minimal forces. Israeli civilians and a minimum number of soldiers could be found at any time in territories where Palestinians were concentrated, with almost no fear and certainly with no need of roadblocks and the daily use of force. The intifada tested Israel’s ability to withstand terrorism. Since control of the territory was almost complete, the IDF stopped terrorism almost completely (but found it hard to deal with mass demonstrations). However, after the violence began, it was only then that the army entered population centers and only when they were protected.\nOnly recapturing the territory in Operation Defensive Shield (April 2002) and its subsequent control (which continued for several months) could lay the foundation and provide the necessary conditions for a successful campaign against terrorism.\nAfter the Oslo Accords (1993), the IDF withdrew from populated areas (1994-1995), and large areas became off-limits for the IDF for more than five years. Therefore, it is not surprising that when the State of Israel found itself besieged by suicide bombing and other forms of terrorist attacks (2000-2002), it did not have a military solution, the use of tanks, APCs, planes, and helicopters notwithstanding. The awful truth was that there could be no military solution because the IDF lost control of the territory after Oslo. Only recapturing the territory in Operation Defensive Shield (April 2002) and its subsequent control (which continued for several months) could lay the foundation and provide the necessary conditions for a successful campaign against terrorism. Therefore, only then could the IDF and the Israel Security Agency (ISA) achieve today’s situation, before the completion of the security fence, in which the percentage of terrorist attack preventions grew and the number of attempted terrorist attacks decreased. After only a few years, terrorism dropped to about a half percent of what it was at its height.\nIt is important to share an observation about the difference in conditions between Israel and almost anywhere else in the world. Israel does not take responsibility for the civilian government of the territories, nor for their civilian policing. This is because the Palestinian Authority regards itself as sovereign in those areas – with a tremendous amount of Israeli support but without Israeli authority. In any other location, control of the territory would also mean taking responsibility for the civilian government, that is, a genuine military administration. That is the crux of the non-military control of a territory and is essential for effective military measures.\nIt is perfectly clear that there can be no control of the territory without more friction with both the civilian and terrorist populations. At first glance that would seem to contradict both natural instinct and the many who say “more friction, more losses; less friction, fewer losses.”The situation on the ground proves that such an approach is invalid and that friction, which is part of controlling the territory, is necessary in order to achieve the freedom of movement necessary to operate. Friction makes it possible to obtain more intelligence, hampers the terrorist who wants to plan an attack without interference, and allows the army to sense which way the wind is blowing. Only then is it possible to react quickly and efficiently to both intelligence and events.\nHistory has shown that an attempt to achieve quiet by reducing friction will fail in the long run, even if in the very short run it provides a pleasant, intoxicating serenity. In some instances, quiet is preserved because the other side needs it to reorganize before renewing its terrorist attacks (for example, Arafat after he returned to the Palestinian Authority in 1994). It is indeed often in the terrorists’ interest to postpone the renewal of attacks (for example, Hizbullah after the IDF withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, for reasons related to Syria and Iran). Whenever those fighting terrorism lost control of the territory, terrorism came back and struck them ten times harder, with forces that had become reorganized and stronger. The terrorists waited until they felt that they could advance their interests through the use of force. This dynamic is precisely what happened in Southern Lebanon on the eve of the 2006 Second Lebanon War and in the Gaza Strip in the aftermath of the 2005 Disengagement.\nThat is the essence of the tahdiya (period of calm) proposed by Hamas, for there is no doubt that under the aegis of a ceasefire it will gain strength and then use force against us. Terrorist organizations stock up on weapons by exploiting their control of the territory and reduced friction with the IDF (for example, after the IDF withdrew from the Gaza Strip and abandoned the Philadelphi route). For Israel to be able to provide the proper response, the IDF will have to take the following steps: conquer the territory, control it, remove most of the terrorist organizations’ operational force, and deploy an effective intelligence system. Every step is difficult, demanding, time consuming, and carries a price in human life. There is no substitute for controlling the territory for anyone whose mission is to fight terrorism successfully.\n3. Relevant Intelligence. Controlling the territory allows the possibility of obtaining relevant intelligence, without which terrorism cannot be fought. Relevance is made up of three factors: precision, quality, and timing. A close relation exists between controlling the territory and intelligence. Without control, there is usually little real chance of enlisting agents from within the populace where the terrorists are active or from within the terrorist organizations themselves. Accumulated experience shows that human intelligence is at the heart of fighting terrorism and, for that reason, control of the territory has an important influence on intelligence capabilities. Moreover, since detentions are the basis for good intelligence obtained by interrogation, and wide-scale detentions can only be carried out when there is genuine control of the territory, only such control will provide the flexibility to activate complete networks to follow up partial information from a lead that is not totally clear.\nNeedless to say, good intelligence also makes control easier by preventing terrorist attacks. It is also clear that the more precise the intelligence, the more it enables focused action to be taken against terrorists without collateral harm. In this way it is possible to remove one of the worst obstacles to effective control, namely despair and useless injury among the local population, which lead many of them to join the terrorists. Separating terrorist elements from the innocent population is an ongoing, essential effort that must be supported by intelligence. For that reason, intelligence must be precise. In addition, it must arrive in time to be efficiently utilized to enable counterterrorist activities to be carried out and terrorist operatives to be attacked. Indeed, the shelf life of intelligence information is crucial; reports must be acted upon while they are still of value (e.g., while the enemy remains at a particular location).\nFighting terrorism requires a special quality of intelligence. It must determine routines, so that every anomaly will be noticeable, and it must enable identification in a timely fashion of every stage of preparation of an attack. To do both, two efforts need to be made. First, networks must be created to provide permanent, fundamental cover of the entire territory in detailing the enemy’s normal behavior. Second, one way or another, intelligence must infiltrate the terrorist organizations’ chain of command, regardless of how loosely organized it might be, to find out what it is planning, and when and where it intends to act. Such intelligence is focused on a specific person or place. Only the combination of both factors will permit military efforts to be directed at fighting terrorism.\nBeyond the intelligence necessary to fight terrorism directly, it is important to legitimize the fight. Today it is clear that both internal and external legitimization is necessary, and this is more evident when the country fighting terrorism is a democracy. Acquiring the sympathy and favorable public opinion of the international community is vital to the long-term fight against terrorism, which tries to present its murderers as “freedom fighters.” Intelligence plays an important role in the struggle for legitimization and sympathy by exposing the lies and cruelty of terrorism in a way that enables the civilians of the country and the entire world to understand the policy of fighting terrorism. Insofar as is possible, intelligence has to support the battle for the hearts and minds of the world without losing its professional credibility. This is not easy. It is a new challenge, still in need of significant clarification, whose importance is nevertheless clear. It bears the danger, however, that it could deflect intelligence efforts from carrying out their main and vital task.\n4. Isolating the Territory Within Which the Insurgency Takes Place. Terrorists cannot operate unless they have freedom of action in the territory around them, from which they need:\nA safe-haven country, where they can find shelter when pursued, and where they can train and acquire the knowledge needed to improve their capabilities.\nWeapons, assuming they cannot buy or manufacture arms of sufficient quality and quantity.\nFinancial backing, which enables them to support sympathizers, maintain terrorist deployment, purchase weapons, and take care of the families of operatives who were killed or detained.\nTwo types of reinforcements: experts in certain types of warfare and “ordinary” fighters, who allow them to fill the ranks when the war against terrorism is successful.\nTerrorists cannot operate unless they have freedom of action in the territory around them.\nIf the military force does not seal the border, efforts to wipe out terrorist elements are useless. This is because the terrorists will replenish their storehouses and refill their ranks with operatives from beyond the border, and it will be impossible to stop them. A truely bottomless pit will exist, and pressuring terrorists will be ineffective, because they will be able to acquire what they need from outside the territory in which they operate regardless of the pressure. It is vital to close borders on two sides, both preventing support from reaching the terrorists and preventing terrorists from entering Israel.\nTo illustrate, the United States’ failure to seal the Iraqi-Syrian and Iraqi-Iranian borders is one of the main reasons for its failure to stop terrorist attacks directed against its soldiers in Iraq during the early years of the insurgency. Ninety-five percent of foreign fighters in Iraq who provide the bulk of suicide bombers came through Syria alone.\n15\nAnd the U.S. Department of Defense was reporting as late as December 2007 that the Iraqi security forces were still in the process of constructing border forts to encircle Iraq.\n16\nThus, during most of the Iraqi insurgency, terrorists have received support, reinforcements, knowledge, and weapons from two sovereign countries.\nThis failure to isolate the Iraqi insurgency from reinforcement made struggling against it a Sisyphean task from a military point of view. No matter how much damage the Americans caused to the terrorists, their links with countries beyond the region in which the war was being waged enabled them to close gaps and become stronger. A similar challenge was posed to the U.S. and its allies in Afghanistan because the Taliban established sanctuaries over its eastern border inside Pakistan. It is extremely difficult to attack sources of arms, money, and men when they are far away, and ten times harder when they are sovereign countries and members of the UN.\nOne of the reasons for the IDF’s failure during the years it was in Lebanon fighting Hizbullah in a secure territory that bordered the State of Israel (1985-2000) was its inability to seal off the security zone in Southern Lebanon from the territory to the north. Thus Hizbullah could wage a guerrilla war without endangering its operatives when they attacked within the security zone. The overwhelming majority of guerrilla attacks were carried out by forces that infiltrated from without and only the tiniest fraction were carried out by residents of the security zone. Hizbullah was conspicuously unsuccessful in its efforts to establish its power inside the region, but the IDF’s inability to seal and isolate the region allowed the organization to wage a continual war while relying on the support of the populace beyond the region controlled by the IDF. The IDF did succeed, to a great extent, in controlling the territory and deploying an effective intelligence network, especially following the support it managed to enlist from the populace of the security zone, regardless of ethnic affiliation. However, its failure to isolate the region in which the fighting took place was critical.\nIn the Second Lebanon War as well, the IDF preferred to launch its attack without first isolating the area of Southern Lebanon at the line of the Litani River. This turned out to be one of the IDF’s main mistakes and one of the principal reasons that the war ended without a clear Israeli success. Although the IDF had total air superiority, Hizbullah continued to stream fresh operatives and weapons systems into the area. No less important was the fact that the Hizbullah forces in the front lines did not feel cut off and, hence, did not perceive that they were threatened. As a result, they continued to fight against the IDF and did not collapse.\nThe same considerations apply to the Palestinian theater as well. Israel decided to forfeit control of the perimeter of the Gaza Strip when it withdrew its forces from the Philadelphi route separating Egyptian Sinai from Gaza. The scale of smuggling increased so that Katyusha rockets and SA-7 shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles entered the Palestinian arsenals. In contrast, no such weaponry entered the West Bank, precisely because Israel firmly controlled its perimeter from the Jordan Valley. By its control of the ground, Israel has also been able to thwart the production and deployment of domestically produced rockets that have been launched in massive numbers from the Gaza area. In short, Israel has paid a price for losing control of Gaza’s perimeter in its counterinsurgency campaign against the Islamist groups, like Hamas, as well as Fatah affiliates, that continued to assault Israeli civilians with rockets even after Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip.\nOther countries that fought terrorist and guerrilla forces have made the same mistake. For example, the United States did not employ ground forces in Laos to prevent fighters and weapons from entering South Vietnam from North Vietnam. The reason was political: the United States had signed an agreement not to violate Laotian neutrality, and the American State Department managed to convince the various presidents to adhere to this agreement, despite the fact that both North Vietnam and China were uninhibited in violating it. Military personnel failed to convince the decision-makers that it was absolutely vital to block the bypasses through countries that were officially neutral. That was apparently the main cause of the American military’s failure after the Tet offensive, which was a military disaster for the Vietcong, to prevent regular North Vietnamese forces from using a well-known trail to enter the south. It was those forces that in the end made the difference.\n17\nThe isolation required in fighting terrorist organizations also includes non-geographical aspects. For example, an effort should be made to create economic isolation, which means preventing the entrance of funds from outside the territory, whether through bank transfers, money changers, or in the suitcases of messengers. Isolation of information is also extremely important, especially in the more professional realms, such as preparing modern explosive devices. In addition, attempts to transfer information, such as bringing in experts who acquired knowledge elsewhere or CDs with professional information to improve fighting ability, must be prevented.\n5. Multi-Dimensional Cooperation Between Intelligence and Operations. The previous conditions analyzed here have won universal recognition and relate to defined military missions. The next condition – novel to a certain extent, at least for Israel’s defense establishment – deals with relations within the campaign against terrorism. This issue is discussed in British literature, especially in relation to the suppression of Communist terrorism in Malaya, as well as in relation to Vietnam\n18\n– the first pointing to success and the second to the lessons learned from failure. The emphasis is different for Israel, because the issues are more military than civilian.\n19\nDetermining the proper solution for Israel began with a long process of trial and error, especially after the second intifada began (September 2000), in view of the terrible price in blood that made a combination of capabilities necessary to eradicate terrorism. Let us illustrate with a situation that could possibly take place today: an action might be carried out in Judea and Samaria in which the operative force is the special forces unit of the police; intelligence is gathered by the Mossad and Military Intelligence but processed by the Israel Security Agency (ISA); the action and reserves are commanded by the territorial brigade, which is subordinate to the Judea and Samaria division; the force will have close support provided by unmanned aircraft and attack helicopters operated by the Air Force, with aid from Territorial Command Intelligence supported by the Chief of Staff’s mapping unit. The operation itself can be put into action within a few hours of receipt of the relevant information from the intelligence community, whether it came from an agent abroad or the observations of a special force in the casbah of a specific city.\nUnderstanding that the reaction time and cooperation of the various elements – intelligence community, army, and police forces – is critical to the war on terrorism led to two important changes in the methods and general organization of those fighting terrorism:\nA great deal of authority was delegated to the lowest ranks, those in contact with the enemy and in the field. Today the freedom of action of a brigade commander in the field and an ISA coordinator in his area is ten times greater than during a lull in the fighting. This is an essential element of the system, and therefore any attempt to reduce this authority, or to demand authorization beforehand from the higher levels of administration, will cause the security systems to lose an important aspect of their ability to fight terrorism.\nThe elements that make intelligence and operational missions effective – such as interrogators, translators, control of unmanned aircraft, etc. – which, for economic reasons and for supervision purposes, had been centralized in headquarters, have been decentralized to lower levels. This was done so that the forces in the field could gather intelligence quickly, understand it immediately, and respond rapidly. The response may be manifested by gathering information, activating an operational force, or having an interrogator arrive at the place of a suspect’s detention to ensure immediate action. The objective is to respond with zero delay to an event, information, or intelligence. As a result, research capabilities and the authority to produce information and evaluate a situation also have to take place at ground level. Understanding this necessity is basic for every action.\nOnly someone who has overcome the bureaucratic obstacles that exist in every organization and who has combined the various advantages that every organization or branch has to offer, while ignoring the obstructions in accordance with the various cultures of command and work, can achieve the capabilities necessary for fighting terrorism. This is without a doubt the Israeli security forces’ most important achievement. Room for improvement still remains in several areas, but we have clearly come a long way. Realizing that people make mistakes, because mistakes are unavoidable in cases of actions undertaken rapidly and under pressure, is at the foundation of every theory of fighting terrorism. Israeli cooperation between its fighting branches and intelligence community can be (and indeed is) a good example for other countries struggling with the same problems and challenges. Moreover, since this method necessitates delegating authority to the forces in the field, the principle of backup must be developed and accompanied by a level of freedom of action usually seen at much higher echelons. To a certain extent, this awareness relates to the best action in classic warfare as well, called “mission command.” In the specific case of the war on terrorism, it is the only alternative that will produce results.\n6. Separating the Civilian Population from the Terrorist Entities. There is a vital need in counterinsurgency operations against terrorist groups to drive a wedge between the civilian population that has nothing to do with terrorism and the terrorist entities against which a military campaign must be conducted. Lt. Col. David Kilcullen, the former Australian officer who now serves as an advisor on counterinsurgency to General David Petraeus in Iraq, has indeed noted: “The enemy needs the people to act in certain ways (sympathy, acquiescence, silence, reaction to provocation) in order to survive and further his strategy. Unless the population acts in these ways, both insurgents and terrorists will wither.”\n20\nIt is important to stress that this separation can only be accomplished if the second condition for success in counterinsurgency is met: namely, control of the territory in which the military struggle with the terrorist operatives is being waged.\nThere is a vital need in counterinsurgency operations against terrorist groups to drive a wedge between the civilian population that has nothing to do with terrorism and the terrorist entities against which a military campaign must be conducted.\nThree levels of separation can be distinguished: Separation can result simply by a military force taking the necessary precautions not to injure innocent civilians who have nothing whatsoever to do with the terrorist groups who are active. This includes preventing collateral damage when using force in order to arrest or eliminate terrorist operatives. It is critical for an armed force to avoid adopting procedures that harm civilians or their freedom of movement when such measures are employed against terrorist operatives through roadblocks or closures. It is extremely difficult to avoid causing any harm to every single innocent civilian, despite all the precautions a security force might put in place, when measures are adopted in a civilian environment in which terrorist operatives are active. Nonetheless, everything must be done to avoid such situations that can bring harm to the innocent or cause sweeping damage to the civilian population as a whole.\nThe IDF’s record could include an enormous accomplishment that was achieved in the Second Lebanon War when it emerged that only Shiites affiliated with Hizbullah were attacked by the Israeli Air Force in Beirut, while in other parts of Lebanon’s capital, the IDF command was careful to minimize any harm that it caused. Lebanese Shiites, Christians, and Sunnis sat in Beirut cafes just a few hundred meters from Hizbullah’s Dahiya Quarter that was almost completely destroyed. The rest of the Lebanese populace knew that Hizbullah’s headquarters were located only in Dahiya, and therefore that would be the only section of Beirut that would be harmed. The carefulness and precision of the Israeli air operation enhanced the prestige of the IDF and averted a situation in which many Lebanese would be motivated to join Hizbullah.\nLebanese Shiites, Christians, and Sunnis sat in Beirut cafes just a few hundred meters from Hizbullah’s Dahiya Quarter that was almost completely destroyed. The rest of the Lebanese populace knew that Hizbullah’s headquarters were located only in Dahiya, and therefore that would be the only section of Beirut that would be harmed.\nA second level of separation between civilians and terrorist groups can be achieved when it becomes possible to drive a clear wedge, and even a conflict of interest, between the civilian population and the terrorist insurgents. An example of this success was Israel’s control of Southern Lebanon prior to its withdrawal from the area in May 2000. During the period in which Israel maintained a south Lebanon security zone, Hizbullah did not succeed in recruiting cells of activists in the area. There were two reasons why this situation developed. First, Israeli intelligence units were able to thwart most recruitment efforts within the local population. Second, this was clearly assisted by the fact that within the south Lebanon security zone a strong economic interest emerged among its residents to preserve the continuation of quiet and to benefit from life under Israeli control, along with the maintenance of their ties as Lebanese citizens to the Lebanese state. It should be added that the standard of living in Southern Lebanon was higher than in many parts of Lebanon and, as a result, most of the southern Lebanese population did not want to give up this advantage.\nThe third and highest level of separation is one in which the local population actually enters into active combat against terrorist organizations. If this can be achieved, then the chances of defeating a terrorist insurgency increase sharply. If the previous two levels are achieved, then the terrorist insurgency cannot gain strength, but if the third level is implemented, then the conditions are put in place for an active struggle against it. That was the situation in Southern Lebanon, where most of the Christian and Druze residents feared the price they would have to pay if Hizbullah ruled in this region. In order to avert Hizbullah’s success, the civilian population in Southern Lebanon actively assisted the IDF.\nIt appeared in early 2008 that the U.S. had achieved this level of separation of the Sunni civilian population of al-Anbar Province in Western Iraq from al-Qaeda and that this is part of the explanation for the success achieved by the U.S. with the implementation of its 2007 “surge strategy” under General David Petraeus. Even the Sunni Arab population, which had previously fought U.S. efforts to facilitate the emergence of a democratic (and Shiite-dominated) regime in Baghdad, understood the damage that would be caused with a takeover of Iraq by al-Qaeda affiliates. As a result, the Sunni Arabs have been prepared to fight for the stability of their sectors and to prevent the infiltration of extremist elements from abroad.\nAny state fighting terrorists should seek to reach the third level of separation, but at least it should be sure that the first level is secured. The success of Israel against Palestinian terrorism that began in the spring of 2002 emanated from the fact that the IDF understood how to keep to an absolute minimum the losses to Palestinian civilians who had no connections with terrorist groups. Yet there were clear limits to the effort of the Israeli success. The longer a civilian population, like the Palestinians, is exposed to a sustained campaign of incitement by the insurgent forces, by the Palestinian Autuority itself, the more difficult it will be to achieve a high level of separation of the population from the insurgency.\nIsrael’s failure to entirely eliminate Palestinian terrorist capabilities requires that it be satisfied with the lowest level of decisiveness in this struggle. For example, Israel has been unable to motivate the civilian Palestinian population to reject terrorism and to wage an armed struggle against Hamas and other militant Islamist groups that lead large parts of Palestinian society.\nAn interesting question is that of priorities, specifically, what is the correct order for fulfilling the aforementioned conditions? It seems to be genuinely necessary to put political decisions first. Whether it is best to begin with the process of isolating the fighting territory or controlling it is an open question. Isolation should be pursued as the first stage, if possible. (In Iraq, for example, it was necessary to start with “conquest.” However, the Americans did not prepare for control and sanitizing its huge territory.) The intelligence effort can begin seriously after occupation, without dependence on isolation and even before control. The organizational system should be prepared in advance, but experience has shown that it changes during war, and a price is paid until it stabilizes correctly according to time, place, and challenge. What could be done against the Palestinians in 1936 by the British Army cannot be done today, even though the territory is identical.\nPart III: The Principles of War in an Asymmetric Confrontation\nWhat Is Asymmetric Warfare?\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Union and especially since the events of September 2001, much has been said and written about the nature of future wars and how those of the present day are different from those of the past. In this context, the term “asymmetric” emerges to describe an important type of warfare. “Asymmetric warfare” seems to mean a war in which the opposing sides, both of which use force to achieve their ends, are not equal in military strength.\n21\nIn Israel, the term is used to refer to the war between the IDF and organizations or armies that do their best not to look like armies. They are not armies, in that it is difficult to locate them in the field, to attack concentrations of their forces, to identify the command and control chain, and to hamper their ability to fight. The enemy is evasive, less hierarchical, can fade into the background, and has no grandiose plans that can be foiled. In essence, if one side is modern and industrially advanced with a professional army and the other side is not, then it can be said that they are fighting an asymmetric war.\nAsymmetry has another important component, namely, the way that decision-makers on both sides relate to the losses they sustain and the injury inflicted upon the opposing civilian population. Generally speaking, and certainly in our part of the world, it is easier for the side that is not a modern country to make decisions leading to the death and injury of enemy civilians. Indeed, we have seen that civilians are the main target for such organizations. The decisions of the modern country, on the other hand, are greatly influenced by the desire to have as few military casualties as possible and usually no less by its sensitivity to the legal and moral aspects of harming civilians. The asymmetry in the way terrorist and guerrilla forces relate to the enemy’s civilians, and their willingness to suffer and even exploit the deaths of their own civilians, is no less critical than the differences in military strength, and perhaps even more so.\nThe definition proposed here for “asymmetric warfare” is “a war between the regular army of a state and an organization using terrorism or guerrilla tactics from within areas under the control of the regular army or crossing the borders of those areas, while receiving support (active or passive) from the civilian population from within which it operates.”This definition does not include global jihad or terrorist cells in London that plot to attack civilians, or the struggle waged by MI5 against such cells, or the counterterrorist activities undertaken in an Arab village in Israel. It does not include ground-to-ground missiles fired by the Iranians, Syrian gas attacks, or the war against anti-aircraft missiles in Syria. From the Israeli point of view, it covers the war against the terrorism emanating from beyond its borders since 1965 (the first Fatah attack); the war against terrorism originating in Jordan, the Gaza Strip, and Judea and Samaria since the late 1960s; and Israel’s wars in Lebanon.\nWhat Are the Principles of War?\nAccording to the IDF Dictionary of Terms:\nThe principles of war are the principles expressing the rules of military thought and action that serve as the permanent basis for combat doctrine….Applying the principles of war differs at different levels and for different operations….Their relative importance can be expected to vary from event to event….The list of principles is a methodological tool that differs from army to army and from era to era.\n22\nThe dictionary emphasizes that while the principles remain the same, the list morphs according to time and place, with application always dependent on context.\nAccording to the introduction to the British doctrine of warfare, issued in 1996,\n23\nmany countries have adopted a list of war principles, concentrating on those that are most important and have proven themselves in the long run as applicable to waging wars. The principles are not a checklist ensuring success, but, used with judgment, they will serve as a guide to planning and carrying out military operations at all levels, as well as the criteria for examining possible directions for action. Ignoring the principles increases the chance of failure in battle.\nIt should be noted that the principles serve the purpose of planning and commanding military campaigns on the battlefield, and do not serve the purpose of resolving the conflicts at the root of the military struggle. Perhaps instead of “principles of war” they should be called “principles of fighting,” to clarify their limits and non-applications. For example, they do not relate to the important broader issues of war, such as social, religious, political, economic, territorial, and cultural factors, without which conflicts and wars between nations or groups cannot be understood.\nThe British list features ten principles:\n1. Selection and maintenance of aim\n 2. Maintenance of morale\n 3. Security\n 4. Surprise\n 5. Offensive action\n 6. Concentration of force\n 7. Economy of effort\n 8. Flexibility\n 9. Cooperation\n 10. Sustainability/administration.\nThe Americans list the following nine:\n1. Objective\n 2. Offensive\n 3. Mass\n 4. Economy of force\n 5. Maneuver\n 6. Unity of command\n 7. Security\n 8. Surprise\n 9. Simplicity.\nWhere the British list “flexibility,” “cooperation,” “maintenance of morale,” and “administration,” the Americans have “unity of command,” “maneuver,” and “simplicity.” The only change the British have made to their list was in the order in which their principles appear. The Americans have recently added three additional principles to the official literature under the heading “Other Principles.” They are:\n1. Restraint\n 2. Perseverance\n 3. Legitimacy.\nThe IDF’s list of principles, defined in 1998, features ten entries\n24\n(parenthetical explanations are the author’s):\n1. Mission and Aim – Adherence to the mission by being guided by the aim (understanding the force’s mission within the framework of the aim – and acting accordingly)\n 2. Optimal utilization of forces (achieving the maximum with what is available while correctly combining capabilities)\n 3. Initiative and offensive (the commander in the field determines action; he must aim for contact and engagement with the enemy)\n 4. Stratagem (achieving surprise, but more importantly, identifying, targeting, and exploiting weak points of the enemy)\n 5. Concentration of efforts (every effort, action, and effect are made to attain the principal mission and aim)\n 6. Continuity of action (unswerving pressure to prevent the enemy from reorganizing; exploiting our forces’ successes)\n 7. Depth and reserves (to distance threats in order to enable continuity of action in crises)\n 8. Security (to avoid exposure of the flanks and weakness following a concerted effort)\n 9. Maintenance of morale and fighting spirit (impels the soldier forward and preserves the unit’s vitality under pressure; essential for a small army to compensate for its materiel weakness)\n 10. Simplicity (each element of the stratagem must be simple to execute even if the broader plan and mission are complicated).\nThe principle of administration (which is not in either the American or IDF list of principles), beyond the understanding that an army marches on its stomach, is extremely important and is the basis for concentrating efforts and forces at the operative level and certainly at the strategic level; neglecting it will keep the army from victory. In a country fighting with a small army within interior lines of operation (the permanent condition in Israel), shifting the strategic effort is critical and depends on administration.\nThe IDF list of principles of war is slightly different from the British and the American. It does not include “unity of command,” perhaps because the IDF’s chain of command is structured differently, nor does it feature “maneuver.” (After the Second Lebanon War, perhaps its inclusion on the list should be considered. It was once thought so obvious that there was no need to mention it.) On the other hand, the IDF includes “continuity of action” (which the Americans have only recently added), replacing “maneuver,” as well as maintenance of morale (which the British include as well). “Depth and reserves” is a principle exclusive to the IDF, apparently because defense is extremely important in view of the inequalities between Israel and its neighbors: numerical, demographic and geographic.\nApplying the Principles of War to Asymmetric Warfare\nUnfortunately, for many years Israel has been fighting a war that fulfills all the criteria of an asymmetric war against various guerrilla forces: Hizbullah in Lebanon; Hamas in Gaza; and Palestinian terrorism from Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. We are not alone. Many other countries have a great deal of experience in fighting terrorism and various types of guerrilla aggression, from the jungles of Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaya to the deserts of Oman, the hills of Greece, Algeria, and Afghanistan, and the alleys of Beirut, Amman, Bint Jbeil, Gaza City, Nablus, and Baghdad.\nSufficient empirical evidence is available to state that armies can successfully fight terrorism and guerrilla organizations, destroying their operative capabilities, even if the conflict remains active in other areas. As was previously demonstrated, ample experience similarly enables us to examine whether or not there is genuine need to change the principles of war. What follows relates to the experience accumulated by the IDF in fighting terrorism under the special conditions prevalent in Israel and in light of the list of principles accepted by the IDF, although it might seem that they are applicable to most armies across the globe, with changes particular to each army and case.\n1. Mission and Aim: This principle is critical for every military move. It calls for both the mission and the aim to be clarified, and it ensures that achieving the mission does in fact serve the aim. Experience shows that every time a mission was not completely clear, for example, in the Second Lebanon War, Israel paid a high price. The principle requires of every commander to use the force he commands to carry out the mission he was given, with the mission serving the aim as defined. The aim always has first priority, serving as a kind of beacon illuminating the mission. At any level of the military hierarchy, the aim is the mission of the superior level. It can be concluded that in some extreme situations, not carrying out the mission can better serve the aim and, in such a situation, the aim always has priority. At the tactical level, for example, if terrorists have left a house in which they were hiding, it is preferable to attack them rather than the house, which had been defined as the mission.\nIf the last war in Lebanon had clear aims, such as “to destroy Hizbullah’s fighting capabilities as a guerrilla organization operating against Israel in south Lebanon in order to allow the Lebanese government to realize its sovereignty in south Lebanon,” and the Northern Command’s mission had been defined as “to prevent Katyusha rockets from being fired into Israel,” there is no doubt that the fighting forces would have been given a clear order that could have been followed. The operative translation of the aim and mission to the command would have meant that there was no alternative but to instruct the ground forces to occupy south Lebanon, destroy Hizbullah’s entire infrastructure, and neutralize its Katyusha-launching capabilities. That would have been a clear, legitimate military mission. At the same time it would have been clear that the mission to conquer Bint Jbeil, because it symbolized Hizbullah success, had no foundation and related neither to the mission nor the aim, meaning there was no point in carrying it out.\nWiping out terrorism in Judea and Samaria after April 2002, when we could extrapolate Israeli casualties to about 1,600 murdered civilians annually, was possible because a clear mission was defined as (if not in these exact words) “the army has to stop terrorism (the aim) to enable Israelis to live normal lives,” and the result was Operation Defensive Shield.\n2. Optimal Utilization of Forces: This principle may seem at first glance to be less necessary for fighting terrorism, but that is not the case. One of the main challenges in fighting a guerrilla or terrorist force is that a combination of many capabilities is necessary for success. If intelligence, special forces, the air force, the army deployed in the field, and the police are not effectively utilized, each in its particular area, terrorism cannot be overcome. One of the most outstanding successes of the Israeli defense system is its ability to wring the utmost out of every element. In 2002, the combination of high-class intelligence from the Israel Security Agency and Military Intelligence, the pinpoint striking capabilities of the Israeli Air Force, and the incredible professionalism of the forces brought about a unified, coordinated operation within Palestinian territory. It was efficient, effective, avoided collateral damage, and was the secret of the security forces’ success in fighting terrorism in Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. It was a classic example of the “full utilization of forces,” in which each component brings its unique capabilities to the battlefield and, combining them, leads to a synergetic result that is far more than the sum of its parts.\nThis principle is manifested in another important way. The IDF faces several challenges at once: the confrontations in Judea, Samaria, the Gaza Strip, and Lebanon as well as preparing for coming wars. If the principle of the full utilization of forces is neglected, and the greatest benefit is not derived from each of the units deployed in the various sectors to deal with the various tasks, the IDF will not be able to meet the challenge. This principle demands that the force fighting terrorism exploit the special nature of each unit to prepare for the war and demands that those responsible for preparation think about how to enable the units to operate well when called upon to fight. Observing the “full utilization” principle is of supreme importance in both operating and building a force to facilitate allocation of tasks between the regular army and the reserves. Those in charge of dispensing resources will agree that, in the long run, at the General Staff level, a most important goal is to carry out the various tasks at a reasonable economic price.\n3. Initiative and Offensive: After the success of “initiative and offensive” in Operation Defensive Shield in April 2002 (as opposed to the defensive failure of the year and a half that preceded it), and the realization that lack of initiative and offensive were the two main weak points of the fighting of some IDF units in the Second Lebanon War, it is clear today that without both it is impossible to fight terrorism and guerrilla organizations. Because the enemy is elusive, this principle is more important in asymmetric warfare than in regular warfare, in which large units operate and there is not always room for uncoordinated local initiative. Every junior officer must understand that the outcome of such a war, in which small forces are put into operation against terrorist and guerrilla organizations, depends on him and what he does, in seeking out and engaging the enemy whenever and wherever possible. This is the key to fighting in the small and sometimes isolated frameworks of asymmetric warfare.\n4. Stratagem: Israeli terminology differs from the British and American, both of whom refer to “surprise.” In Israeli terminology, surprise is an important and perhaps necessary component of stratagem, but not its essence. What is crucial is exploiting surprise to be able to strike the enemy’s weakest point and shatter his center of gravity. Surprise is never the last step but rather the first; the aim is to strike the decisive blow. The objectives of stratagem and exploiting surprise are both important and bring added benefits. During the last war the army did not internalize the principle of stratagem; it made do with surprising Nasrallah only and did not exploit the surprise to win. Adopting stratagem in every move must be at the heart of military thought. If in a regular war there is no choice, and stratagem can be replaced by greater force or firepower, in asymmetric warfare there is no replacement because in many instances too much force or firepower will do more harm than good.\nCompared to the principle of the “full utilization of forces,” the following three – “concentration of efforts,””continuity of action,” and “depth and reserves” – seem at first glance to be less critical for fighting terrorism. However, they are indeed important and necessary.\n5. Concentration of Efforts: This was lacking in the Second Lebanon War. The IDF did not fully concentrate its ground power in any location, nor did it have a central goal in south Lebanon in which to engage its forces throughout the front. For a long time there had been no main thrust in fighting terrorism in Judea, Samaria, or the Gaza Strip. This changed when the mission was defined as the detention or destruction of whoever enabled terrorist operatives to carry out their attacks, from the head of Hamas to the technician who attached the explosives to the body of the suicide bomber. All were the main thrust. Only after it became clear that most of the IDF’s existing capabilities had to be concentrated on locating and detaining or destroying the personnel in the chain of terror did the IDF manage to lower the level of terrorism.\nIn many instances in the war against terrorism, the focus of the main thrust is not a physical location but rather a specific process or individuals. Thus, proper planning in asymmetric warfare would be to examine the definition of the main thrust necessary to keep the terrorists from bringing their schemes to fruition. This is the center of gravity of every terrorist organization. When this becomes the only criterion for a military action, then all systems participating in the effort will know where to place their focus and how to prioritize their efforts.\n6. Continuity of Action: At every stage in Israel’s war against terrorist and guerrilla forces, the enemy was able to rest, redeploy, and later carry out more terrorist attacks until we brought the principle of continuity of action into play. Only when the IDF understood this concept and decided to tenaciously use what it called “the lawnmower tactic” – killing or detaining everyone who appeared on the terrorist chain – did it overcome terrorism. In an attempt to stop the continuity of IDF actions that kept it from building up its strength, Hamas suggested a tahdiya, a mutual period of no attacks. Since the Hamas objective was to gain breathing space to reorganize and build up its forces, it was indeed beneficial that the State of Israel did not agree to this.\nAt the strategic level, not implementing the principle of continuity (for example, withdrawals from Gaza and Lebanon plus subsequent desisting from the fight against terrorism there) led to and will lead to the strengthening of terrorism, which will be difficult for us to deal with in the future. Even those who claim that such steps are politically justified cannot ignore their military significance. This again shows that the principles of war are important at all levels and that it is not more important to chase an anonymous terrorist in order to detain him than it is to prevent the enemy from organizing and improving his capabilities. In the war against terrorism, continuity – while often challenging to carry out – is one of the more important principles, especially because of the almost total dependence on continuous intelligence, which is not always available.\n7. Depth and Reserves: The following three examples show the importance of depth: Israel has learned the hard way that depth is critical when the enemy possesses rockets and missiles. Kassam rockets falling in Ashkelon and Katyushas in Haifa have illustrated the importance of ten theoretically insignificant kilometers. For example, if Israel had controlled a ten-kilometer strip in south Lebanon, most of the missiles that hit Haifa would not have done so. By the same token, with five additional kilometers of Israeli control in the northern Gaza Strip, Ashkelon and Sderot would have been beyond Kassam range.\nIn the fight against terrorism in Judea and Samaria, a simple fence with room to maneuver behind it raises the level of security. When there is no depth on the other side of the fence, and it is defended only from the Israeli side, the result is abduction of soldiers to the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Thus, nothing can replace depth, even in the case of a fence.\nThe situation in south Lebanon before the IDF withdrew was different from what it became after the withdrawal. Losing the slim depth Israel had had in the north led to a concentration of Hizbullah activity penetrating into the State of Israel, without the terrorists having to waste time and energy on their way to the fence. Today the presence of UNIFIL is meant to generate a kind of depth, but, in my opinion, that effort will not bear fruit in the long run, and we will again lose our depth.\nThe part played by “reserves” should also not be neglected, both in their strategic and operative aspects: they are less salient for fighting terrorism but critical for fighting guerrilla forces. If in the Second Lebanon War, the Northern Command had had genuine reserves and had sent a large force to occupy the surrounding area after the first success in the region of Bint Jbeil, this would have bisected Hizbullah’s ground deployment and perhaps even led to its partial destruction in places where the IDF could have threatened Hizbullah’s rear. The fact that efforts were made along the entire front instead of using reserves did not enable genuine achievements to be made.\nThe four principles of “optimal utilization of forces,” “concentration of efforts,” “continuity of action,” and “depth and reserves” would seem to illustrate the advantages a regular army has over guerrilla and terrorist forces in a war – if it utilizes these advantages correctly. For example, the principle of “full utilization of forces” can genuinely express the technological superiority a country usually has over a terrorist or guerrilla organization. If the army knows how to fully exploit technological capabilities and integrate them correctly and intensively into the war effort, it will have a tremendous advantage. In fighting terrorism in the Gaza Strip and Judea and Samaria since September 2000, one of the IDF’s secret weapons has been its success in employing its technological capabilities. In the Second Lebanon War, the IDF successfully applied technology to destroy Hizbullah’s heavy long-range rocket launchers. On the other hand, in Israel’s attempts to destroy the host of small rocket launchers from which most of the rockets were fired, the limitations of technology were made evident, as was the danger of becoming a slave to it.\nThe principles of “concentration of efforts” and “continuity of action” are effective in the arsenal of a regular army because it can generally rely on them more than the smaller terrorist and guerrilla organizations can. Differences in size make the terrorist and guerrilla groups weaker, and their concerted efforts usually do not go beyond the operational level. It is therefore clear why continuous military pressure can hamper terrorists’ efforts to exert pressure on an army or on the civilians of the enemy country, with the exception of pinpoint locations, such as the concentrated Kassam attacks on Sderot. When an army does not make the most of its advantages and allows the enemy to rest, redeploy, and plan, the results are liable to be problematic. That was made conspicuously clear between September 2000 and March 2002: the IDF responded to individual cases of Palestinian terrorism, among other reasons, because the political level did not allow it to operate continuously in Judea and Samaria. The result was a drastic rise in the number of terrorist attacks and casualties, especially among civilians. The change in perception and the implementation of the two aforementioned principles, among others, brought about a drastic and immediate reduction in the number of attacks and casualties. The principle of “continuity of action” has been scrupulously preserved in Judea and Samaria because its indispensable nature has been recognized.\nGenerally speaking, “depth and reserves” are the privilege of states rather than organizations, and their utilization will afford a state’s army great advantage. In a state applying this principle, its army can push the enemy into smaller or isolated areas, enabling it to use its larger space to operate from all directions at the same time. Terrorist organizations and guerrilla forces, which are usually small, find depth relatively unattainable. Terrorists generally have no reserves, and guerrilla groups have to be extremely advanced to transform themselves into the kind of army which has significant reserves during fighting.\nThus it can be seen that the principles of “optimal utilization of forces,” “concentration of efforts,” “continuity of action,” and “depth and reserves,” which are sometimes regarded as proof of the irrelevance of the principles of war in asymmetric warfare, are actually at the core of the advantage that regular state armies have over irregular forces.\n8. Security is essential for fighting terrorism; it complements “initiative and offensive.” Because of its importance, one of the most problematic uncertainties for decision-makers in the realm of fighting terrorism concerns the amount of resources to devote to “security.” Assuming that resources are limited, how much should be taken from the main thrust of attacking terrorist and guerrilla forces to secure fighting forces on the base and during the fighting itself? How many of the total forces should be allocated to securing the rear and the civilian population? Another aspect of “security” is the plan to conceal the activities of forces so that the enemy does not discover them. This was another factor that we apparently did not completely understand in Lebanon, and Hizbullah showed that it knew how to use this weakness of ours to its own benefit.\n9. Maintenance of Moral and Fighting Spirit: This principle is at the core of every commander’s concern, especially in the case of warfare using small groups or even individuals against the terrorist. On most occasions, such operations cannot be supported by artillery, air support, or by the momentum of broader military units that surround them. In a war against terrorist or guerrilla organizations, the fighting spirit of the individual soldier and small group is supremely important, especially when they are far away from superior command and have to decide for themselves how to act. Morale and fighting spirit are particularly tested in asymmetric warfare because it is a long-term battle with no end in sight, rather than a one-time effort, no matter how difficult, such as the wars that the IDF was accustomed to fight in the past. By the nature of asymmetric warfare, not only do soldiers have a great many dull, exhausting, frustrating missions to carry out – and they have to be carried out extremely well – but regular units sometimes carry out missions that seem more appropriate for special units. Both demands test morale and fighting spirit as well as the discipline and professionalism of the soldiers and their commanders. The need to confront civilians in securing roadblocks, for instance, or aggressive operations in densely populated areas, make the issue of morale and discipline even more complex. Thus, the principle of maintaining morale and fighting spirit is even more important in all forms of the war against terrorist and guerrilla forces.\n10. Simplicity: While this principle is generally important on the battlefield, it is ten times more important in fighting terrorism. This is mainly because counterterrorism is by nature complicated by its need to operate among the civilian population. Complex actions usually increase danger to forces due to involvement with the surroundings. Therefore simplicity is important in the field, at the operative level as well as the tactical. Indeed, it seems to be more important operationally than tactically: the army is clearly interested in every unit being able to operate against terrorism and thus reduce dependence on special units, which always operate intensively. Beyond the desire to obviate a dependence that would limit them, many actions have to be carried out on short notice (often to preserve the principle of continuity of action). Without simplicity, there would be too few operations, and some would be undertaken too late because of the time necessary to complete preparations. When opposing an elusive enemy, simplicity is almost a sine qua non in creating long-term pressure.\nThe above analysis makes it clear that when the IDF’s principles of war are examined in light of the needs of asymmetric warfare, none of them is extraneous, irrelevant, or even unimportant. However, it is clear that applying these principles demands deliberation and professional skill. No two operational events or wars are similar, and the way in which the principles are integrated into a plan or carried out needs to change each time. Moreover, at the appearance of a contradiction between principles, a commander’s merit is judged by how well he prioritizes and applies them. With the exception of the first principle, “aim and mission,” everything depends on the commander and his assessment of the situation.\nThe question now is whether a principle is lacking, without which it would be difficult to fight terrorist and guerrilla forces, and which, if added, would make for better planning and a significantly easier fight. In my view, the most important difference between classic warfare and asymmetric warfare is the involvement of civilians as active or passive partners on one of the fighting sides. This difference is part of the essence of asymmetric warfare, and its dimensions are determined by the irregular side, which uses terrorist and guerrilla tactics from within and alongside the civilian population.\nRegarding other conditions that have changed a great deal recently, it seems that media exposure has caused a change, for two reasons:\nThe public at large is partially but immediately exposed to the events and situation on the battlefield. When this is done imperfectly, there is no possibility of halting the correspondents and cameramen who are on the scene or of preventing them from transmitting their pictures to the outside world. Decision-makers are exposed to continuous, uncontrolled media reports during events, and they must respond to them immediately.\nFor that reason, external pressures can interfere with the running of a small country such as Israel, which is very sensitive to international public opinion. As a result, Israel sometimes acts according to interests opposed to its own.\nAn intensive study of asymmetric warfare shows two innovations: civilians are part of the terrorist organizations’ strength and capabilities, and therefore friction with them cannot be avoided; and the media expose counterterrorist activities in a way which is liable to influence the way decision-makers respond, with little connection between the truth and what is reported. These two innovations taken together demand that a new principle be added to the IDF’s list of war principles: “image and legitimization,” whose purpose is to make commanders of all ranks relate to both in planning the fighting and its execution. This means that at every level, whoever plans and carries out an action in war has to consider how it will be presented and appear in the media. He should, by commission or omission in planning and execution, reinforce both internal (inside the State of Israel) and external (by the world in general) legitimization for Israel’s actions in the war. Military planners have to be aware of the issue of involvement of civilians: on the one hand, some of them may have to be harmed when there is no choice, and on the other, there must be untiring effort to prevent them from being injured, insofar as this is possible. All this must be done while paying the greatest possible attention to the need to explain to the Israeli public, and to the world, every action carried out, including failures.\nAs opposed to the Americans, it is not necessary for Israel to add “restraint” in the use of force as a principle of war. For Israel that would be a grave error. Sometimes the need might arise, but generally speaking, a small country like Israel can deal with terrorism and guerrilla organizations only if its response is not proportional and is carried out in such a way as to convince the other side that it too has something to lose. A proportional response will drag Israel into a war of attrition whose rules will be determined by the terrorists, and which it will lose. A country like Israel can successfully cope with terrorism and guerrilla tactics only if it retains the ability to respond disproportionately; otherwise, it will find itself fighting according to the enemy’s rules.\nI have given a great deal of thought as to whether the principle of “intelligence” should be added, without which it is impossible to fight terrorism, and have decided that adding it would go beyond accepted principles of war. In an article in Maarachot,\nI defined the necessary conditions for fighting terrorism, one of which is intelligence. However, it is a condition and not a principle of war. In addition, I found that the British apparently also had their doubts as to whether it was a principle or a condition, and they too came to the conclusion that it was the latter.\nConclusions\nThe discussion above has shown that one can essentially vanquish terror, even if it is a victory that only prevents terror from successfully implementing its plans, while it does not influence the terrorists’ intentions. Victory of this type requires constant and determined effort from the moment that it is attained, for if not, conditions will revert to their former sorry state as soon as the terror organizations deem themselves strong enough.\nAn evaluation of the war on terrorism must address the question of the level of victory over terror that can be obtained under conditions of the battle theater – total victory, temporary victory, or sufficient victory – and how one can improve the level of victory over time. It is clear that such a discussion is relevant only if one embraces the contention that the democratic state is essentially capable of subduing the terror that menaces it.\nSix conditions have been set forth without which no military force can fight terrorism. After these conditions have been met, which is admittedly not easy, the difficult, complex, crushing, dull war, without flags and trumpets, begins: fitting together bits of intelligence information, drawing conclusions, putting into operation small forces under difficult conditions within a mixed populace of terrorists and innocent civilians in a densely-populated urban center or isolated village, and small tactical victories. The war itself must be focused on prevention, and that includes detentions and attacking the terrorist operatives who put terrorism in motion and who are the critical resource of the terrorist organizations. It is a long war with no success promised, but based on preconditions it is possible to wage it and, in the conditions of the State of Israel, absolutely necessary. The history of our success in Judea and Samaria (West Bank) since the spring of 2002 illustrates that clearly.\nAn examination of the IDF’s principles of war in light of the needs of planning and fighting terrorist and guerrilla forces (i.e., asymmetric warfare) clearly indicates that each of the principles taken individually and as a group are vital guides to fighting this type of war.\nCHINA\nChina knows plenty about Islamic insurgency and its potential to destroy the nation state. Even in the 1980s and 1990s, some 25 years ago, China had an “Islamic insurgency” threat concentrated in its eastern resource-rich and low population Xinjiang region. Before that, since the early days of the Peoples’ Republic in the 1950s, China has addressed Islamic insurgency with mostly failed policies and strategies but more recently a double strategy of domestic or local repression, but aid and support to Islamic powers thought able to work against djihadi insurgents – outside China – has produced results.\nThe Chinese strategy runs completely against the drift of Western policy and favours Iran.\nA report in ‘Asia Times’, 27 February 2007, said this: “Despite al-Qaeda’s efforts to support Muslim insurgents in China, Beijing has succeeded in limiting (its) popular support….. The latest evidence came when China raided a terrorist facility in the country’s Xinjiang region, near the borders with Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Kirgizstan. According to reports, 18 terrorists were killed and 17 were captured”.\nChinese reporting, even official white papers on defence against terror are notoriously imprecise or simply fabricated. The official line is there is no remaining Islamic insurgency and – if there are isolated incidents – China’s ability to kill or capture militants without social blowback demonstrates the State’s “hearts and minds” policy in Xinjiang, the hearth area for Chinese Muslims, is working.\nChinese official attitudes to Islamic insurgency are mired with veils of propaganda stretching back to the liberation war against anti-communist forces. These featured the Kuomintang which had a large Muslim contingent in its Kuomintang National Revolutionary Army. The Muslim contingent operated against Mao Zedong’s central government forces – and fought the USSR. Its military insurgency against the central government was focused on the provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang and continued for as long as 9 years after Mao took power in Beijing, in 1949.\nAdding complexity however, the Muslim armed forces had been especially active against the Soviet Union in the north and west – and by 1959 the Sino-Soviet split was sealed. Armed hostilities by Mao’s PLA against the Red Army of the USSR broke out in several border regions, with PLA forces aided by former Muslim insurgents in some theatres. Outside China, and especially for Arab opinion, Mao was confirmed as a revolutionary nationalist similar to non-aligned Arab leaders of the period, like Colonel Husni al-Zaim of Syria and Colonel Nasser of Egypt.\nCHINA’S THREAT TO WESTERN STRATEGY IN THE MENA\nEspecially today, some Western observers feign “surprise” at China’s total hostility towards UN Security Council approval for “surgical war” strikes against Syria. The reasons for this overlap with Russia’s adamant refusal to go along with US, Saudi Arabian, Turkish and French demands for a UNSC rubber stamp to trigger “regime change” in Syria but are not the same. For China the concept of “regime change” with no clear idea – officially – of what comes next is anathema.\nAs we know, when or if al Assad falls, only chaos can ensue as the country breaks apart, but this nightmare scenario for China is brushed aside by Western politicians as a subject for “later decision”.\nChina’s successful efforts to keep the global jihad from spreading into its territory is surely and certainly taken as a real challenge by Saudi-backed insurgents in western China. Various reports indicate the al-Qaeda organization trains about 1 000 mostly Xinjiang-origin Uighurs and other Chinese Muslims every year. Located in camps in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kirgizstan and elsewhere, this terror training has continued since at least the mid-1990s, for a total of more than 15 years.\nThe focus on Xinjiang, formerly called Turkestan is no accident. The region’s Russian influence is still strong, reinforced by Muslim migration from Russia in the 19th century, accelerated by the Russian Civil War and 1917 revolution. During China’s warlord era preceding Mao’s rule, the USSR armed and supported the Muslim separatist East Turkestan Republic which only accepted Mao’s rule when the PRC under the Chinese communists was fully established in 1949. The longstanding East Turkestan jihadi movement (ETIM) is highly active today after being relaunched in the early 2000′s, especially since the Iraq war of 2003. It however mainly acts in “external theatres” such as Pakistan’s Baluchistan province. The Baluchi of Pakistan have long-term rebellious relations with the central government in Islamabad, and are allied with Kurd nationalists in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Turkey.\nOil, Qatar, China and the Global Conflict\nThe US Council on Foreign Relations in a 29 May 2012 briefing on Xinjiang noted that since the Chinese Qing dynasty collapse of 1912, the region has experienced various types of semi-autonomy and on several occasions declared full independence from China. The Council for example notes that in 1944, factions within Xinjiang declared independence with full support from the USSR, but then cites US State Dept. documents claiming that Uighur-related terrorism has “declined considerably” since the end of the 1990s and China “overreacts to and exaggerates” Islamic insurgency in Xinjiang.\nNotably, the US has declassified the ETIM Islamic movement – despite its terror attacks – as a terrorist organization. The ETIM was defined as such during the Bush administration years, but is no longer listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in the State Dept. FTO list as from January 2012.\nChina has fully recognized the Islamic insurgency threat, with its potential for drawing in hostile foreign powers seeking to destroy national unity and break the national government. Its concern, shared by Indian strategists and policy makers is to “stop the rot” in the MENA.\nTHE CHINESE STRATEGY\nUnofficially, China regards the US and Saudi strategy in the MENA and Central Asia as “devil’s work” sowing the seeds of long-term insurgency, the collapse of the nation state and with it the economy. The US link with and support to Israel is in no way ignored, notably Israel’s Yinon plan for weakening central governments and dissolving the nation state right across the MENA.\nChina’s main concern is that Central Asian states will be affected, or infected by radical Islamic jihadi fighters and insurgents drifting in from the West, from the Middle East and North Africa. These will back the existing Islamic insurgent and separatist movement in resource-rich Xinjiang. To keep Central Asian states from fomenting trouble in Xinjiang, China has cultivated close diplomatic ties with its neighbors, notably through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization which has a secretariat concerned with counter-insurgency issues.\nUS analysts however conclude, very hastily, that China “instinctively supports the status quo” and therefore does not have an active international strategy to combat djihadi violence and anarchy outside China. US analysts say, without any logic, that China will respond to and obediently follow initiatives from Washington and other Western powers – as it has starkly not done in the UN Security Council when it concerns the Western powers’ long drawn out attempt to repeat, for Syria, their success in 2011 for getting UNSC approval to the NATO war in Libya!\nChina was enraged, and regarded it as betrayal when its support for limited action by NATO in Libya – a rare instance of China compromising on nonintervention – turned into an all-out “turkey shoot” to destroy the Gaddafi clan. Libya was handed over to djihadi militants, who subsequently declared war against central government, an accelerating process resulting in Libya, today, having no central government with any real authority. That experience certainly hardened Beijing’s responses on Syria.\nPost-Mao China has restored the concept of Chinese cultural continuity, with a blend of Confucian, Taoist and Buddhist strands which had been been weakened but not completely destroyed in the years of ideologically-driven Communism. For the Communists of Mao’s era “history was bunk”, not even a mixed bag but an unqualified evil that must be smashed. The Chinese attitude to radical Islam as embodied in the ideologies of Wahabism and Salafism is the same – they are treated as a denial of world history and its varied cultures, with immediate and real dangers for China. Its counter-insurgency strategy against Islamic radicals is the logical result.\nThis strategy ensures closer Tehran-Beijing relations, usually described by Western analysts as a “balancing act” between ties to Washington and growing relations with Iran. China and Iran have developed a broad and deep partnership centered on China’s oil needs, to be sure, but also including significant non-energy economic ties, arms sales, defense cooperation, and Asian and MENA geostrategic balancing as a counterweight to the policies and strategies of the United States and its local allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Chinese attention now focuses the Washington-Riyadh axis and its confused and dangerous MENA region geostrategy, resulting in a de facto proliferation of Islamic djihadi insurgents and the attack on the basic concept of the nation state across the region. The Chinese view is that Iran’s version of “Peoples’ Islam” is less violent and anarchic, than the Saudi version.\nOPPOSING THE WASHINGTON-RIYADH AXIS\nBoth Chinese and Indian strategists’ perceptions of the US-Saudi strategy in the MENA, and other Muslim-majority regions and countries is that it is dangerous and irresponsible. Why the Western democracies led by the US would support or even tolerate the Saudi geostrategy and ignore Israel’s Yinon Plan – as presently shown in Syria – is treated by them as almost incomprehensible.\nChina is Tehran’s largest trading partner and customer for oil exports, taking about 20% of Iran’s total oil exports, but China’s co-operation is seen as critical to the Western, Israeli and Arab Gulf State plan to force Iran to stop uranium enrichment and disable the capacity of its nuclear program to produce nuclear weapons. Repeated high-level attempts to “persuade Beijing” to go along with this plan, such as then-US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner’s 2012 visit to Beijing, however result each time in Chinese hosts politely but firmly saying no. This is not only motivated by oil supply issues.\nFlashpoints revealing the Chinese-US divide on Iran crop up in world news, for example the US unilateral decision in January 2012 to impose sanction on Chinese refiner Zhuhai Zenrong for refining Iranian oil and supplying refined products back to Iran. This US action was described by China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman as “totally unreasonable”. He went on to say that “China (has) expressed its strong dissatisfaction and adamant opposition”.\nAt the same time, China’s Xinhua Agency gave prominence to the statement made by Iran’s OPEC delegate Mohamed Ali Khatibi: “If the oil producing nations of the (Arab) Gulf decide to substitute Iran’s oil, then they will be held responsible for what happens”. Chinese analysts explained that China like India was irritated that Iranian oil sanctions opened the way for further de facto dominance of Saudi Arabia in world export supplies of oil, as well as higher prices.\nIran is however only the third-largest supplier of oil to China, after Angola and Saudi Arabia, with Russia its fourth-largest supplier, using EIA data. This makes it necessary for China to run sustainable relations with the Wahabite Kingdom, which are made sustainable by actions like China’s Sinopec in 2012 part-funding the $8.5 billion 400 000 barrels-per-day refinery under construction in the Saudi Red Sea port city of Yanbu.\nThe Saudi news and propaganda outlet Al Arabiya repeatedly criticises China and India for their purchase of Iranian oil and refusal to fully apply US-inspired sanctions. A typical broadside of February 2013 was titled “Why is China still dealing with Iran?”, and notably cited US analysts operating in Saudi-funded or aided policy institutes, such as Washington’s Institute for Near East Policy as saying: “It’s time we wised up to this dangerous game. From Beijing’s perspective, Iran serves as an important strategic partner and point of leverage against the United States”. US analysts favourable to the Saudi strategy in the MENA – described with approval by President Eisenhower in the 1950s as able to establish a Hollywood style Saudi royal “Islamic Pope” for Muslim lands from Spain to Indonesia – say that Iran is also seen by China as a geopolitical partner able to help China countering US-Saudi and Israeli strategic action in the Middle East.\nA 2012 study by US think tank RAND put it bluntly: “Isolated Iran locked in conflict with the United States provides China with a unique opportunity to expand its influence in the Middle East and could pull down the US military in the Gulf.” The RAND study noted that in the past two decades, Chinese engineers have built housing, bridges, dams, tunnels, railroads, pipelines, steelworks and power plants throughout Iran. The Tehran metro system completed between 2000 and 2006 was a major Chinese engineering project.\nTHE BIG PICTURE\nChina’s Iran policy and strategy can be called “big picture”. Iranian aid and support to mostly but not exclusively Shia political movements, and insurgents stretches from SE Asia and South Asia, to West and Central Asia, Afghanistan, the Caspian region, and SE Europe to the MENA. It is however focused on the Arabian peninsula and is inevitably opposed to Saudi geostrategy. This is a known flashpoint and is able to literally trigger a third world war. Avoiding this is the big picture – for China.\nLi Weijian, the director of the Research Center of Asian and African Studies at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies puts it so: “China’s stance on the Iranian nuclear issue is not subject to Beijing’s demand for Iranian oil imports, but based on judgment of the whole picture.” China is guided in foreign relations by two basic principles, both of them reflecting domestic priorities. First, China wants a stable international environment so it can pursue domestic economic development without external shocks. Second, China is very sensitive to international policies that ‘interfere in or hamper sovereign decisions”, ultimately tracing to its experience in the 19th and 20th centuries at the hands of Western powers, and the USSR, before and after the emergence of the PRC. It adamantly opposes foreign interference in Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang.\nThis includes radical Islamist or djihadi interference, backed by any foreign power. While China has on occasions suspected Tehran of stirring Islamic insurgency inside its borders it sees the US-Saudi geostrategy of employing djihadists to do their dirty work as a critical danger, and as wanton interference. Indian attitudes although not yet so firm, are evolving in the same general direction. Both are nuclear weapons powers with massive land armies and more than able to defend themselves.\nClaims by Western, mostly US analysts that China views Iran as exhibiting “unpredictable behaviour” in response to US-led sanctions and that Iran is “challenging China’s relations with its regional partners” can be dismissed. In particular and concerning oil, China is well aware that Iran will need many years of oil-sector development to return to anything like pre-Islamic revolution output of more than 5 million barrels a day. Unless oil sanctions are lifted, Iran’s oil output will go on declining, further increasing the power of the Gulf States led by Saudi Arabia, and Shia-governed but insurgency threatened Iraq to dictate export prices.\nChina dismisses the claim that its policies have hampered US and other Western political effort to dissuade Iran from developing nuclear weapons capability.\nChina’s distaste for toppling almost any central government, even those run by dictatorial strongmen springs from a deep sense of history – marked by insecurity about the uncertain political legitimacy of governments arising from civil war and revolution – like the PRC. At its extreme, this Chinese nightmare extends to fears that if the US-Saudi geostrategy can topple governments in the Middle East almost overnight, what will stop them from working to bring down China’s government one day? Unlike almost all MENA countries minus the oil exporters, China has scored impressive victories in the fight against poverty. Its economy although slowing creates abundant jobs and opportunity.\nFor China, this is the only way to progress.\nHARDENING POLICIES AND POSITIONS\nThe emerging Chinese anti-Islamist strategy also underlines a menacing reality for the US and other Western powers. China rejects the belief there is still only one superpower in today’s world—the USA. The USA’s weakened economy and uncontrollable national debt, its confused and cowardly drone war, its slavish support to Israeli and Saudi whims do not impress China – or India.\nTo be sure China’s classic-conventional weapons development programs lag far behind the US. The Chinese military strategy for pushing back US dominance focuses global reach ballistic missiles, tactical nuclear weapons, drones, submarines, and military space and cyberwarfare capabilities.\nWith the PLA it possesses the biggest land army in the world. No US warmonger, at least saner versions would “take on China”.\nChina has invested heavily in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, as well as Iran. It does not want to see its investment effort destroyed by deliberately promoted Islamic anarchy. Also, its Middle Eastern presence will continue due to the fact that while US dependence on oil imports is declining, China overtook the US as the world’s largest oil importer on a daily basis, this year, several years ahead of analysts’ consensus forecasts.\nThe likely result is that China is now poised and almost certain to strengthen relations with Iran. The intensifying Syrian crisis as well as the dangerously out of control US-Saudi-Israeli djihadi strategy, of fomenting sectarian conflict and destroying the nation state in the MENA, will likely prompt China to soon take major initiatives\nLinks\nRussian Counterinsurgency: The Two Paradigms of Russian COIN\nTerrorism in Russia - Wikipedia\nWinning Counterinsurgency War: The Israeli Experience\nAl Qaeda in China, Islamic Insurgency in Uighur-Xinjiang, China and the US-Saudi-Israeli Plan for the Middle East - Global Research', 'upvote': 1, 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020'}}, 'question_title': "Which are the countries from which Muslims don't try to mess with?

All my life I’d been used to being able to tell by going to the bathroom in the morning what kind of temperature we had, how warmly or lightly I had to dress to be comfortable outside. Suddenly, I had no real way of knowing. It took me about five winters to adjust to that.\nBesides, there’s no cold room to go into to “cool off” when one is hot from cooking. And opening the window in the middle of winter—that seems preposterous when fuel is so expensive. Thus, while central heating might seem like a most desirable luxury with no downside, in reality there is a lot to adjust to.', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 15, 2020'}}, 'question_title': 'Why don’t Amish people use central heating?', 'question_author': 'Thomas Benjamin Woolum'}, 244: {'no_of_view': '793', 'no_of_follower': 6, 'create_time': 'Apr 12, 2020', 'topic_list': [], 'answer_count': 4, 'respond': {0: {'view': 25, 'user_name': 'Regino Estabillo', 'answer': 'Romans 8:26 says: “In like manner, the spirit also joins in with help for our weakness; for the problem is that we do not know what we should pray for as we need to, but the spirit itself pleads for us with unuttered groanings”.\nSometimes, we do have feelings or thoughts that we cannot clearly express with words.

The comment by Thomas at John 20:28 was directed to Jesus.\nJehovah God is given the title of “Almighty God” in the scriptures, which indicates that there are other gods that are mighty (Dagon is named in the Bible, for example) but not almighty. Note, also, that three verses later Jesus is called “the Son of God” (John 20:29–31). There is no objection to John’s writing that Thomas referred to Jesus as a deity.\nThe New World Translation study note on John 20:28 states:\nLit., “The Lord of me and the God [ho the·osʹ] of me!” Some scholars view this expression as an exclamation of astonishment spoken to Jesus but actually directed to God, his Father. Others claim that the original Greek requires that the words be viewed as being directed to Jesus. Even if this is so, the intent of the expression “my Lord and my God” is best understood in the context of the rest of the inspired Scriptures. Since the record shows that Jesus had previously sent his disciples the message, “I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God,” there is no reason to believe that Thomas thought that Jesus was the almighty God. (See study note on Joh 20:17.) Thomas had heard Jesus pray to his “Father,” calling him “the only true God.” (Joh 17:1-3) So Thomas may have addressed Jesus as “my God” for the following reasons: He viewed Jesus as being “a god” though not the almighty God. (See study note on Joh 1:1.) Or he may have addressed Jesus in a manner similar to the way that servants of God addressed angelic messengers of Jehovah, as recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures. Thomas would have been familiar with accounts in which individuals, or at times the Bible writer of the account, responded to or spoke of an angelic messenger as though he were Jehovah God. (Compare Ge 16:7-11, 13; 18:1-5, 22-33; 32:24-30; Jg 6:11-15;13:20-22.) Therefore, Thomas may have called Jesus “my God” in this sense, acknowledging Jesus as the representative and spokesman of the true God.\nSome argue that the use of the Greek definite article before the words for “lord” and “god” indicates that these words refer to the almighty God. However, in this context the use of the article may simply reflect Greek grammar. Cases where a nominative noun with the definite article is used as vocative in Greek can be illustrated by a literal translation of such scriptures as Lu 12:32 (lit., “the little flock”) and Col 3:18–4:1(lit., “the wives”; “the husbands”; “the children”; “the fathers”; “the slaves”; “the masters”). In a similar way, a literal translation of 1Pe 3:7 would read: “The husbands.” So the use of the article here may not be of significance in determining what Thomas had in mind when he made his statement.\nFurther reading: Questions From Readers - Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY', 'upvote': 3, 'date': 'Apr 13, 2020'}, 2: {'view': 38, 'user_name': 'Terry Stroot', 'answer': 'Doesn’t say at all that Thomas looked up.\n“Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.

And that is a hard thing to get your mind around, but if God knows everything, that includes the future, which includes everything I will do, everything you will do, and everything God will do… um hang on. If God knows everything, then that means God knows everything that he will do in the future too, if he can’t do something other than what he already foresaw, then God is a slave to his own knowledge. So now we have to do a little special pleading, and say God has free will, and his only limit is knowing everything based on the choices he will make.\nBut that brings us back to whether we have free will or not, and the answer, if god is omnipotent and omniscient, himself excluded, is no, no we do not. If God can predict the every consequence of his actions and make them happen exactly as he wants, all part of God’s plan so to speak, then everything you or I ever do or say, was predetermined right from the moment God created Adam and Eve. Move a few skin cells around on Adam’s left pinky toe, and I could be an entirely different person. If I do something that is not part of God’s plan, then God is neither all knowing, nor all powerful. You can claim he gave us free will, but if he knows what I’m going to do, before I do, then no he didn’t. And that includes whether or not I will be admitted to the Kingdom of Heaven or not, left to rot in Purgatory, or sent into the fiery pit of Hell. All predetermined. The same goes for you too.\nWhich is why perhaps, it is more comforting to believe that God is fallible, that he can make mistakes, and there are limits to what he can know or do, that way he truly could roll the dice marked “Free Will” and we would be individuals, rather just part of an elaborate program he wrote thousands of years ago.

Jesus Christ, in his Sermon on the Mount, stated: “Moreover it was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’ However, I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of fornication, makes her a subject for adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.” (Mt 5:31, 32) Also, after telling the Pharisees that the Mosaic concession of divorcing their wives was not the arrangement that had prevailed “from the beginning,” Jesus said: “I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the ground of fornication, and marries another commits adultery.” (Mt 19:8, 9)\nOther things from the Scriptures about DIVORCE\nLegal dissolution of the marital union. Hence the severance of the marriage bond between a husband and a wife. Various original-language terms for “divorce” literally mean “send away” (De 22:19, ftn), “release” or “loose off” (Mt 1:19, Int; 19:3, ftn), “drive out; cast out” (Le 22:13, ftn), and “cut off.”—Compare De 24:1, 3, where the expression “a certificate of divorce” literally means “a book of cutting off.”\nWhen Jehovah united Adam and Eve in wedlock, he made no provision for divorce. Jesus Christ made this clear when answering the Pharisees’ question: “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife on every sort of ground?” Christ showed that God purposed for man to leave his father and his mother and stick to his wife, the two becoming one flesh. Then Jesus added: “So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has yoked together let no man put apart.” (Mt 19:3-6; compare Ge 2:22-24.) The Pharisees next asked: “Why, then, did Moses prescribe giving a certificate of dismissal and divorcing her?” In reply, Christ said: “Moses, out of regard for your hardheartedness, made the concession to you of divorcing your wives, but such has not been the case from the beginning.”—Mt 19:7, 8.\nThough divorce was allowed among the Israelites on various grounds as a concession, Jehovah God regulated it in his Law given to Israel through Moses. Deuteronomy 24:1 reads: “In case a man takes a woman and does make her his possession as a wife, it must also occur that if she should find no favor in his eyes because he has found something indecent on her part, he must also write out a certificate of divorce for her and put it in her hand and dismiss her from his house.” Just what “something indecent” (literally, “the nakedness of a thing”) was is not specifically stated. That it was not adultery is indicated by the fact that God’s law given to Israel decreed that those guilty of adultery be put to death, not merely be divorced. (De 22:22-24) Doubtless, originally the ‘indecency’ that would have given a Hebrew husband some basis for divorcing his wife involved serious matters, perhaps the wife’s showing gross disrespect for the husband or bringing shame on the household. Since the Law specified that “you must love your fellow as yourself,” it is not reasonable to assume that petty faults could be used with impunity as excuses for divorcing a wife.—Le 19:18.\nIn the days of Malachi many Jewish husbands were dealing treacherously with their wives, divorcing them on all kinds of grounds, ridding themselves of the wives of their youth, possibly in order to marry younger, pagan women. Instead of upholding God’s law, the priests allowed this, and Jehovah was greatly displeased. (Mal 2:10-16) That Jewish men were using many grounds for divorce when Jesus Christ was on earth is indicated by the question the Pharisees put to Jesus: “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife on every sort of ground?”—Mt 19:3.\nAmong the Israelites a man customarily paid a dowry for the woman who became his wife, and she was considered his possession. While enjoying many blessings and privileges, hers was the subordinate role in the marital union. Her position is further shown by Deuteronomy 24:1-4, which pointed out that the husband might divorce his wife but said nothing about the wife’s divorcing her husband. Being considered his property, she could not divorce him. In secular history, the first recorded instance of a woman in Israel trying to divorce her husband was when King Herod’s sister Salome sent her husband, the governor of Idumea, a bill of divorce dissolving their marriage. (Jewish Antiquities, XV, 259 [vii, 10]) That such divorce action by women had begun to crop up when Jesus was on earth or that he foresaw its development may be indicated by Christ’s words: “If ever a woman, after divorcing her husband, marries another, she commits adultery.”—Mr 10:12.\nCertificate of Divorce. It should not be concluded from the later abuses that the original Mosaic divorce concession made it easy for an Israelite husband to divorce his wife. In order to do so, he had to take formal steps. It was necessary to write a document, to “write out a certificate of divorce for her.” The divorcing husband had to “put it in her hand and dismiss her from his house.” (De 24:1) While the Scriptures do not provide additional details on this procedure, this legal step apparently involved consultation with duly authorized men, who might first endeavor to effect a reconciliation. The time involved in preparing the certificate and legally implementing the divorce would afford the divorcing husband opportunity to reconsider his decision. There would have to be a basis for the divorce, and when the regulation was properly applied, this would logically serve as a deterrent to rash action in obtaining divorces. Then, too, the wife’s rights and interests were thus protected. The Scriptures do not disclose the contents of the “certificate of divorce.”\nRemarriage of Divorced Mates. Deuteronomy 24:1-4 also stipulated that the divorced woman “must go out of his house and go and become another man’s,” meaning that she was eligible for remarriage. It was also stated: “If the latter man has come to hate her and has written out a certificate of divorce for her and put it in her hand and dismissed her from his house, or in case the latter man who took her as his wife should die, the first owner of her who dismissed her will not be allowed to take her back again to become his wife after she has been defiled; for that is something detestable before Jehovah, and you must not lead the land that Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance into sin.” The former husband was barred from taking the divorced wife back, perhaps in order to prevent the possibility of any scheming between him and this remarried wife to force her divorce from her second husband or to cause his death, thereby allowing for remarriage with her previous husband. If her former marriage mate took her back, it would be an unclean thing in God’s eyes; the first husband would make himself look foolish because he had dismissed her as a woman in whom he had found “something indecent” and then, after she had been lawfully joined to another man and used as his wife, he took her back once again.\nDoubtless the very fact that the original husband could not remarry his divorced wife after she became another man’s, even if that man divorced her or died, made the husband contemplating divorce action think seriously before acting to end the marriage. (Jer 3:1) However, nothing was said that would prohibit him from remarrying his divorced wife if she had not remarried after the legal severance of their marriage tie.\nSending Away Pagan Wives. Before the Israelites entered the Promised Land, they were told to form no marriage alliances with its pagan inhabitants. (De 7:3, 4) Nonetheless, in the days of Ezra, the Jews had taken foreign wives, and in prayer to God, Ezra acknowledged their guiltiness in this matter. In response to his urging and in acknowledgment of their error, the men of Israel who had taken foreign wives sent them away “along with sons.”—Ezr 9:10–10:44.\nHowever, Christians, coming from all different nations (Mt 28:19), were not to divorce mates who were not worshipers of Jehovah, nor was it even desirable for them to separate from such marriage partners, as Paul’s inspired counsel shows. (1Co 7:10-28) Yet, when it came to contracting a new marriage, Christians were counseled to marry “only in the Lord.”—1Co 7:39.\nJoseph’s Contemplated Divorce. While Mary was promised in marriage to Joseph, but before they were united, she was found to be pregnant by holy spirit, and the account states: “However, Joseph her husband, because he was righteous and did not want to make her a public spectacle, intended to divorce her secretly.” (Mt 1:18, 19) Since engagement was such a binding arrangement among the Jews at that time, the word “divorce” is properly used here.\nIf an engaged girl submitted to having relations with another man, she was stoned to death the same as an adulteress. (De 22:22-29) In cases that might result in stoning an individual to death, two witnesses were required in order to establish the person’s guilt. (De 17:6, 7) Obviously, Joseph had no witnesses against Mary. Mary was pregnant, but Joseph did not understand the matter thoroughly until Jehovah’s angel gave him the explanation. (Mt 1:20, 21) Whether the ‘secret divorce’ he contemplated would have included the giving of a certificate of divorce or not is not stated; but it is likely that Joseph was going to act in accord with the principles set out at Deuteronomy 24:1-4, possibly giving her the divorce in front of just two witnesses so the matter would be settled legally without bringing undue shame on her. While Matthew does not give every detail regarding the procedure Joseph intended to follow, he does indicate that Joseph wanted to deal mercifully with Mary. Joseph is not considered an unrighteous man for this, but rather, it was “because he was righteous and did not want to make her a public spectacle” that he “intended to divorce her secretly.”—Mt 1:19.\nCircumstances Barring Divorce in Israel. According to God’s law given to Israel, there were conditions in which divorce was impossible. It might occur that a man took a wife, had relations with her, and then came to hate her. He might falsely state that she was not a virgin when he married her, thus improperly charging her with notorious deeds and bringing a bad name upon her. When the girl’s parents produced evidence that their daughter had been a virgin at the time of her marriage, the men of the city would have to discipline the false accuser. They would fine him a hundred silver shekels ($220), giving these to the girl’s father, and she would continue to be the man’s wife, it being stated: “He will not be allowed to divorce her all his days.” (De 22:13-19) Also, if it was discovered that a man seized a virgin who was not engaged and had relations with her, it was stipulated: “The man who lay down with her must also give the girl’s father fifty silver shekels [$110], and she will become his wife due to the fact that he humiliated her. He will not be allowed to divorce her all his days.”—De 22:28, 29.\nWhat is the only Scriptural basis for divorce among Christians?\nJesus Christ, in his Sermon on the Mount, stated: “Moreover it was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’ However, I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of fornication, makes her a subject for adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.” (Mt 5:31, 32) Also, after telling the Pharisees that the Mosaic concession of divorcing their wives was not the arrangement that had prevailed “from the beginning,” Jesus said: “I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the ground of fornication, and marries another commits adultery.” (Mt 19:8, 9) Today, generally, distinction is made between “fornicators” and “adulterers.” According to modern usage, those guilty of fornication are unmarried persons who willingly have sexual relations with someone of the opposite sex. Adulterers are married persons who willingly have sexual relations with a member of the opposite sex who is not their legal marriage mate. As shown in the article FORNICATION, however, the term “fornication” is a rendering of the Greek word por·neiʹa and includes all forms of illicit sexual relations outside of Scriptural marriage. Hence, Jesus’ words at Matthew 5:32 and 19:9 mean that the only divorce ground that actually severs the marriage bond is por·neiʹa on the part of one’s marriage mate. The follower of Christ may avail himself of that divorce provision if that is his desire, and such a divorce would free him to marry an eligible Christian.—1Co 7:39.\nSexually immoral acts committed by a married person with someone of the same sex (homosexuality) are filthy and disgusting. Unrepentant persons of this type will not inherit God’s Kingdom. And, of course, bestiality is Scripturally condemned. (Le 18:22, 23; Ro 1:24-27; 1Co 6:9, 10) These grossly filthy acts come under the broad designation por·neiʹa. It is also noteworthy that, under the Mosaic Law, homosexuality and bestiality carried the death penalty, freeing the innocent mate for remarriage.—Le 20:13, 15, 16.\nJesus Christ pointed out that “everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” (Mt 5:28) But Jesus did not say that what was in the heart, but not carried into action, furnished a basis for divorce. Christ’s words show that the heart should be kept clean and one should not entertain improper thoughts and desires.—Php 4:8; Jas 1:14, 15.\nThe Jews’ rabbinic law laid emphasis on the married person’s duty to perform the marital act and allowed a husband to divorce his wife if she was unable to produce children. However, the Scriptures do not give Christians the right to divorce their mates for such a reason. Barrenness for many years did not cause Abraham to divorce Sarah, Isaac to divorce Rebekah, Jacob to divorce Rachel, or the priest Zechariah to divorce Elizabeth.—Ge 11:30; 17:17; 25:19-26; 29:31; 30:1, 2, 22-25; Lu 1:5-7, 18, 24, 57.\nNothing is said in the Scriptures that would permit a Christian to divorce a marriage partner because that one was physically unable to perform the marital act, or had gone insane or contracted an incurable or loathsome disease. The love that Christians are to show would call, not for divorce, but for merciful treatment of such a mate. (Eph 5:28-31) Nor does the Bible grant Christians the right to divorce their marriage mates because of difference in religion; it shows instead that by remaining with an unbelieving mate the Christian may win that individual over to the true faith.—1Co 7:12-16; 1Pe 3:1-7.\nIn his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said that “everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of fornication, makes her a subject for adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.” (Mt 5:32) By this, Christ showed that if a husband divorces his wife for reasons other than her “fornication” (por·neiʹa), he exposes her to adultery in the future. That is so because the unadulterous wife is not properly disunited from her husband by such a divorce and is not free to marry another man and have sexual relations with another husband. When Christ said that whoever “marries a divorced woman commits adultery,” he was referring to a woman divorced on grounds other than “on account of fornication” (por·neiʹa). Such a woman, though divorced legally, would not be divorced Scripturally.\nMark, like Matthew (Mt 19:3-9), recorded Jesus’ statements to the Pharisees regarding divorce and quoted Christ as saying: “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her, and if ever a woman, after divorcing her husband, marries another, she commits adultery.” (Mr 10:11, 12) A similar statement is made at Luke 16:18, which reads: “Everyone that divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he that marries a woman divorced from a husband commits adultery.” Taken alone, these verses seem to forbid all divorce by Christ’s followers, or at least to indicate that a divorced individual would not be entitled to remarry except after the death of the divorced marriage partner. However, Jesus’ words as recorded by Mark and Luke must be understood in the light of the more complete statement recorded by Matthew. He includes the phrase “except on the ground of fornication” (Mt 19:9; see also Mt 5:32), showing that what Mark and Luke wrote in quoting Jesus on divorce applies if the ground for procuring the divorce is anything other than “fornication” (por·neiʹa) committed by the unfaithful marriage partner.\nA person is not Scripturally obligated to divorce an adulterous though repentant marriage partner, however. The Christian husband or wife may extend mercy in such a case, even as Hosea seems to have taken back his adulterous wife Gomer and as Jehovah extended mercy to repentant Israel that had been guilty of spiritual adultery.—Ho 3.\nGod’s original standard restored. It is clear that Jesus Christ’s statement pointed to a return to the high standard for marriage originally set by Jehovah God, and it showed that those who would become Jesus’ disciples would have to adhere to that high standard. Though the concessions provided by the Mosaic Law were still in effect, those who would be true disciples of Jesus, doing the will of his Father and ‘doing’ or putting into effect the sayings of Jesus (Mt 7:21-29), would no longer avail themselves of such concessions to exercise “hardheartedness” toward their marriage mates. (Mt 19:8) As genuine disciples, they would not violate the original divine principles governing marriage by divorcing their mates on any grounds other than the one Jesus specified, namely “fornication” (por·neiʹa).\nA single person who commits fornication with a prostitute makes himself “one body” with that person. Similarly, the adulterer makes himself “one body,” not with his legal wife, but with the immoral person with whom he has sexual relations. The adulterer thus sins not only against his own personal flesh but also against his legal wife who until then has been “one flesh” with him. (1Co 6:16-18) For that reason adultery provides a true basis for breaking the marital bond in accord with divine principles, and where such ground exists, a divorce obtained brings about the formal and final dissolution of the legal marriage union, freeing the innocent partner to remarry with honor.—Heb 13:4.\nFor further research click here', 'upvote': 1, 'date': 'Apr 13, 2020'}, 1: {'view': 'error', 'user_name': 'Barbara LeMaster', 'answer': '', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 13, 2020'}, 2: {'view': 58, 'user_name': 'Ross Yerkes', 'answer': 'From what they have told me, there are a number of reasons why they can divorce, like violence, extreme mental cruelty and a husband not supporting the family materially.

Abrahamic faiths are very wary of such experiences and any supernatural aspects of spirituality or Spirit-ism.\nWhereas most East Asian religions tend to see it as normal and natural part of spirituality, Abrahamic religions tend to view them as “devilish” and have specific passages in their holy books outright condemning such experiences and practices.\nEastern religions retained a lot of it’s animistic and sometimes Shamanistic roots and beliefs, which means they see the divine inhibiting and present in every part of the physical world we live in. Humans aren’t the only one who have souls. Rocks, trees, animals have spirits and sometimes are inhibited by Gods and Goddesses. Even objects created by humans can take on a spirit or consciousness with time. The world isn’t created for humans, and humans aren’t the priorities of Gods and Goddesses and we can’t just use the world and it’s resources however we want to.\nAbrahamic religions on the other hand mostly views the divine as separate from this physical world, and while God is omnipresent, he is not present in every physical object. Abrahamic faiths also believes that only human beings have souls or spirit, every other creation in the world are just that: objects created by God for humans to use as they see fit because we are God’s most perfect creation.\nBecause of this different attitude in worldview, Abrahamic religions believes that any supernatural experiences either come from God himself (very rare and usually only happens to the most pious of humans) or some devil or infernal spirit from Hell (more common as forces of Hell are constantly trying to lead humans away from God). And this leads to the scrutiny and sometimes disbelief in any kind of supernatural experience.

What is the purpose of this life? Furthermore, we should question ourselves: What do we want to really get out of this world by the time we die? Is it our aim that we want to accumulate wealth, have a big family, a successful career in life? How about preparing ourselves for the real, eternal life? The Quran gives us the answers:\n[Quran 30:8] Why do they not reflect on themselves? God did not create the heavens and the earth, and everything between them, except for a specific purpose, and for a specific life span. However, most people, with regard to meeting their Lord, are disbelievers.\n٨:٣٠أَوَلَم يَتَفَكَّروا فى أَنفُسِهِم ما خَلَقَ اللَّهُ السَّمٰوٰتِ وَالأَرضَ وَما بَينَهُما إِلّا بِالحَقِّ وَأَجَلٍ مُسَمًّى وَإِنَّ كَثيرًا مِنَ النّاسِ بِلِقائِ رَبِّهِم لَكٰفِرونَ\nOur Purpose, Goals and Priority\nWe have many things in our lives we would like to achieve at any given time. Some are short term goals, some are long term goals. Our goals and desires in life never end. Many are attainable and within our reach, some are wishes which may or may not come true. Yet, one day we find ourselves having achieved many of the things that we thought of being difficult or almost impossible to achieve.\nOne Life to Live?\nAfter we have our own money to spend, we set up new goals. We usually want a new car, get a house, have a successful career, move to a bigger house, and so on. If we have children, we worry about our children’s well-being, education, and their future. We want them to be the best, and to have the best. We sometimes work ourselves to death trying to achieve all that. Nevertheless, our desire to have better social and material things is endless. As the Quran states in Q41:49: “The human being never tires of imploring for good things ...”\nThe next generation will want to achieve similar, if not better things in their lives. The cycle will continue until the end of the world.\n[Quran 21:16-17] We did not create the heavens and the earth, and everything between them for amusement. If we needed amusement, we could have initiated it without any of this, if that is what we wanted to do.\n[Quran 29:64]This worldly life is no more than vanity and play, while the abode of the Hereafter is the real-life if they only knew.\nThere is nothing wrong in wanting to be the best we can be, and to have the best we can have, as long as we do realize the purpose of our lives, are appreciative of God’s blessings and use our resources to strive more in the cause of God:\nUse the provisions bestowed upon you by God to seek the abode of the Hereafter, without neglecting your share in this world. Be charitable, as God has been charitable towards you ... [Q28:77]\nWhat Is Our Priority?\nOur ultimate goal in this life should be to be a righteous person so that God will be pleased with us. In all our actions and decisions, our priority should be the eternal life of the Hereafter, not the temporary one on this earth. If we can maintain this throughout our lives, then we can be a winner both in this life and in the Hereafter. It will be the biggest triumph of our lives if we make it to Heaven, even barely, by God’s leave.\n[Quran 17:18] Anyone who chooses this fleeting life as his priority, we will rush to him what we decide to give him, then we commit him to Gehenna, where he suffers forever, despised and defeated. [Q17:19] As for those who choose the Hereafter as their priority, and work righteousness, while believing, their efforts will be appreciated.\n[Quran 3:185] Every person tastes death, then you receive your recompense on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever misses Hell, barely, and makes it to Paradise, has attained a great triumph. The life of this world is no more than an illusion.\nPath to Happiness\nOur happiness in this life and in the Hereafter depends on whether or not we become submitters to God alone. As submitters, we should make pleasing God our highest priority. We should make it our ultimate goal to fulfil God’s expectation of us. We must not set up any idols besides God, whether the idol is a saint, prophet, our ego, business, children, spouse, money or what have you.\nWe should aim to live a righteous life and treat each other amicably. We should not lie, cheat, or back-bite people. We should do our best to live a life in accordance with God’s commandments in the Quran. Simply put, we should do the things that God wants us to do, and avoid the things that God does not want us to do. Our ultimate aim in doing all this is to get ourselves worthy of God’s blessings and mercy.\nWhen pleasing God becomes the most important aspect of our lives, God makes everything wonderful for us:\nGod promises those among you who believe and lead a righteous life, that He will make them sovereigns on earth, as He did for those before them, and will establish for them the religion He has chosen for them and will substitute peace and security for them in place of fear. All this because they worship Me alone; they never set up any idols beside Me ... [Q24:55]\nWe have to strive to be righteous and to be in the right path in order to attain God’s promise. Therefore, we should examine ourselves sincerely at every opportunity. Any time we have a problem in any aspect of our lives; we should search for the lesson, and learn from our lessons. We should submit to God’s will, and remember that God will test us through different means to see if we are steadfast.\nNo person and nothing else should take priority over God. Once we make this the most important aspect of our lives, we will possess the most valuable thing one can ask for—God’s support. But, if we make anything more important than pleasing God, we will be tested over and over. If we do not realize that fact after all the tests and we keep confusing our priorities, then we may lose both in this life as well as in the Hereafter.\n[Quran 10:5] He is the One who rendered the sun radiant, and the moon a light, and He designed its phases that you may learn to count the years and to calculate. God did not create all this, except for a specific purpose. He explains the revelations for people who know.\n٥:١٠هُوَ الَّذى جَعَلَ الشَّمسَ ضِياءً وَالقَمَرَ نورًا وَقَدَّرَهُ مَنازِلَ لِتَعلَموا عَدَدَ السِّنينَ وَالحِسابَ ما خَلَقَ اللَّهُ ذٰلِكَ إِلّا بِالحَقِّ يُفَصِّلُ الـٔايٰتِ لِقَومٍ يَعلَمونَ\n[Quran 15:85] We did not create the heavens and the earth, and everything between them, except for a specific purpose.

He is and was the Son of God. (God in the flesh) He came to earth to fulfill the plan of God to bring mankind back into a relationship with the Father (God).

God is a Holy God and those who come to God must be Holy. Man sins and is unholy..so the first prayer in having a relationship with God is one of repentance from “not believing” that Jesus was real and died for your sins to “believing” and acknowledging to God that you seek forgiveness and accept Jesus as your personal sacrifice and Savior. Once a person accepts Jesus Christ as Savior God forgives them of their sin, adopts them into the family of God, makes them a new creature, makes them “born again” (creates a spirit within the physical body…now you are body, soul, and spirit).

At Lavinium there was an ancient sanctuary dedicated to her by the Latins; on the other hand, in Rome, she had in olden times no State worship, at least under this name. Her earliest Roman name appears to have been Murcia,which was interpreted later on as Myrtea, goddess of myrtles. How she came to be identified with the Greek love-goddess Aphrodite is not clear. The oldest historical mention of her worship in this character is in 217 B.C., when, by the order of the Sibylline books, after the disaster at Lake Trasimene, a temple dedicated to the Venus of Mount Eryx in Sicily, an ancient and well known place for the worship of Aphrodite Urania, was built on the Capitol. Besides the various forms of worship which she enjoyed, corresponding to the Greek cult of Aphrodite, Venus had a special significance as Genetrix, or mother of the Roman people through her son Aeneas. She was especially worshipped as mother of the race of the Julii, which claimed descent from her grandson Iulus, the son of Aeneas. It was on this aecount that Caesar, in the Forum built by him in 46 B.C., erected a magnificent temple in her honour as Genetrix, in which games were annually held for eleven days. To her, as mother of the whole Roman race, as well as to Roma, the personification of Rome, Hadrian dedicated a splendid double temple, completed 135 A.D., the ruins of which can still be seen in the neighbourhood of the Coliseum. In later times it was called templum urbis. (See ARCHITECTURE, fig. 13.) The 1st of April was sacred to Venus as the day on which she was worshipped by the Roman matrons, together with Fortuna Virilis, the goddess of prosperity in the intercourse of men and women, and also with Concordia, as Verticordia, the goddess who turns the hearts of women to chastity and modesty. Other holidays were kept to her in the same month as goddess of prostitution. (See also VENUS LIBITINA. On the types of Venus in works of art, cp. APHRODITE.)\nLIBITINA\nAn ancient Italian goddess of voluptuous delight and of gardens, vineyards, and vintages, originally connected with Venus, and therefore often called Venus Libitina. She was also regarded as the goddess of death and of the departed, and was therefore afterwards identified with Proserpina. By an ancient ordinance, ascribed originally to Servius Tullus, for every person who died in Rome a piece of money was deposited in her temple. Everything requisite for burials was kept there, and had to be bought or borrowed from it.\nhttp://classicsupenn.org', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020'}}, 'question_title': 'When was the worship of Aphrodite introduced into Rome?', 'question_author': 'Drew Christopher'}, 360: {'no_of_view': '4,774', 'no_of_follower': 2, 'create_time': 'Apr 14, 2020', 'topic_list': [], 'answer_count': 11, 'respond': {0: {'view': 10, 'user_name': 'Ralph Thomas', 'answer': 'Without the resurrection there is no Christianity.

My wife and I separated. She immediately began attending my church (she had refused up until then). I felt uncomfortable with her suddenly there and looking all faithful and such so I left.\nOver the next couple of years I had a paradigm shift in my world outlook. I re-examined subjects like alcohol, cannabis, LGBTQ+ and other Christian touchy points and realized that I didn't agree with the church's view on these things. I then realized that I no longer could justify belief in some of the old testament stories. In addition, I couldn't close my eyes and plug my ears when they write about God telling them to take no prisoners except virgins for sex slaves.\nIF that's how He really is, then I don't want to worship that God. Maybe we should worship one who believes in rights for all people?\nThen I began wondering what it would be like to BE a god. I pretended my cat was my creation and I had complete control over his life… when he eats, where he sleeps, which body part to remove (neutered him). I asked myself questions like, how would I treat him? Do I expect him to act like me or do I expect him to act like a cat? Should he use toilets like me or is it ok for him to act natural and poop outside as I designed and programmed him.\nAnd so I slowly came to realize that if God exists, he's not expecting much of me, just to act like a human. Enjoy the things he built for us… sex, food, movies, theme parks, cannabis,beer etc\nHe's WAY smarter than me. He knows that I can't be held responsible for having not accepted Jesus if noone ever told me about him. Not exactly fair.\nThen I realized that if God loves everyone, regardless if they act a certain way, then I've been doing “religion” wrong all these years. I had restricted my actions and thoughts to that narrow view called Christianity.\nThat's when I realized the church wasn't for me. I don't believe what they believe in many ways and I believe many denominations interpret the bible in favourable ways.\nI therefore had no idea which, if any denomination would be the “correct” one to get me saved. Or even if Christianity was the key since I could have easily been Jewish or Muslim. Again, if Jesus was never preached to me then not my fault! Even if I was Jewish or Muslim or Hindu etc.\nMy view of God has grown from the limited vengeful hateful God of Christianity to something bigger, more loving and much less judgemental…. IF He exists then He loves all of us and really couldn't care less if we try to act more like him because it's unfair to ask a being with infinitely less intelligence to act just like him. He knows that's not fair and He's not stupid.\nSometimes I feel Christians really think He's gullible, or that he follows a recipe. If you pray enough, he'll always answer your prayer. Nothing about that is true. If God has his own path for your life, no amount of praying can change that. Jesus knew that when he was facing execution and asked if it was possible to have this execution put off, yet his will be done.\nSo even praying doesn't seem to do anything apart from soothing the person. The bible says pray expectantly… let me say I've done that for 30 years and I've found a lot of comfort in prayer…but I could never ever find a tie between prayer and granted prayer. It's not consistent, not repeatable. It is therefore unreliable.\nIf you had a car that would only start sometimes, I think you'd find a new car.\nThat's where I'm at.

But in his vision of the risen Jesus on the road to Damascus, Paul recognized in him a fuller, eschatalogical revelation of God. In other words, Christ, the bearer of the image of the invisible God, has superseded the Torah as the revelation of God and of his will for mankind. This becomes clear when we make the following comparison:\nThe Ten Commandments are “the covenant” (Deuteronomy 4:13 ; Exodus 34:27,28). “I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people (Isaiah 42:6 ; 49:8). Christ’s body and blood are our covenant (Matthew 26:26–28).\nThe Ten Commandments are the witness (testimony) that God is the Creator (hence “the two tablets of the testimony” Exodus 32:15 ; 34:29). Christ is “the faithful and true witness” (Revelation 3:14). In the New Testament we have “the testimony of Jesus Christ” (Revelation 1:2).\nThe Ten Commandments are the Ten Words (Exodus 34:27,28). Jesus is the Word (John 1:1).\nThe Sabbath is the sign given to Israel (Exodus 32:17 ; Ezekiel 20:12). Jesus is the sign given to the New Testament community (Isaiah 7:14 ; Luke 2:34 ; 11:30). His Spirit is also said to be the sign (Ephesians 1:13 ; 4:30).\nThe Sabbath is the rest (Exodus 20:8–11). Christ is the Rest (Matthew 11:28), and the Gospel invites us to enter into rest by faith in Jesus (Hebrews 4:3, 9–11).\nRemember the Sabbath Day (Exodus 20:8). “Do this in remembrance of Me” (Luke 22:19). “Remember Jesus Christ” (2 Timothy 2:8). “I want to remind you of the gospel” (1 Corinthians 15:1).\nAlso, Jesus is the New Moses in that he recapitulates (supersedes) him:\nThe prophecy of Deuteronomy 18:15 “a prophet like me” is often used in the New Testament to apply to Jesus (Acts 3:22,23 ; 7:37).\nJesus too, is hidden from the wrath of the King who kills all the male children. Jesus also returns to the homeland after the one who sought his life is dead (Exodus 4:19 ; Matthew 2:20,21).\nBoth Moses and Jesus are unrecognized by their own people as God’s elect (Acts 7:27). The people try to stone them both (Exodus 17:4 ; Numbers 14:10 ; John 10:31–33 ; 11:8).\nThe close communion Moses enjoyed with God is surpassed by Christ (Exodus 33:20 ; John 1:17,18).\nJesus’ Sermon on the Mount reminds us of another law-giver on another mountain (Exodus 19 ; Matthew 5).\nJesus appoints seventy elders just as Moses did (Numbers 11:16 ; Luke 10:1).\nBoth Jesus and Moses fasted forty days before giving the law to the people.\nBoth were glorified on a mountain.\nJesus fed the multitude in a desert place. This reminded the people of Moses and the bread from heaven (John 6).\nJesus said he was the water of life. This declaration was made at the Feast of Tabernacles when the people were celebrating the water from the smitten rock (John 7:37–39).\nJesus declared he was the light of the world while the people were celebrating the pillar of fire which led Israel through the wilderness (John 8:12).\nJesus said to Nicodemus “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up” (John 3:14).\nJesus’ final discourse to his disciples presents a remarkable parallel to Moses’ farewell speech recorded in Deuteronomy. Some of Jesus’ parting words are quoted directly from Deuteronomy.\nJesus of course, not only recapitulates Moses. He supersedes Moses. This is a truth taught in biblical types and anti-types. Thus John the evangelist not only makes parallels between Christ and Moses, he contrasts them and shows the superiority of Jesus (John 1:17). This reveals an important argument presented by John. The Jews had absolutized Moses as he was represented in the law — the Torah. The rabbis taught that the Torah was the Logos — the divine wisdom or word (Proverbs 8). They also said the Torah was the bread, water and light which lead to the life of the age to come. John denies these popular assumptions. He declares that this Logos, the bread and water and light of eternal life, are embodied in the second person of the Godhead, incarnate in Jesus of Nazareth.\nSources:\nT, Francis Glasson, Moses in the Fourth Gospel, for an excellent, detailed treatment of Moses and Jesus.\nBrian Wintle “Paul’s Conception of the Law of Christ and Its Relation to the Law of Moses” Reformed Theological Review 38, no 2 (May-Aug. 1979): 45.\nVerdict Journal of Theology Vol.2.

They have become a nation of Israel by faith, with Abraham as their spiritual progenitor; and the original twelve apostles (with Matthias replacing Judas Iscariot) have started the current, figurative twelve tribes.\nPreceding this covenant this one was the older one with the twelve tribes of Israel, whom they have had as a literal and direct ancestor.\nNow, both of these covenants have a general respect for the life that God imbued into His other animate creations. This is why specifically consuming the blood of animals was forbidden by Mosaic law; and advised against for early Gentile believers in Christ, for their Israelite siblings’ sake. (It is assumed that the latter judgment only applies to Gentiles eating amidst a community of Jews or Samaritans who observe the old dietary restrictions.)\nAdditionally, both covenants identify humans as the race who has been given dominion over all the rest of the earth. They are marked; they are special, according to both Judaism and Christianity.\nHowever, a lot of commandments and underlying morals have in this new covenant taken a new shape, which they had not had in the old covenant. They usually have become less ceremonially restrictive, but more ethically so. A fair number of them have transformed thus with the reasoning, implied or stated outright, that God’s people’s “hearts were [no longer as collectively] hard” (Matthew 19:8; Mark 10:5).\nThis is not a new concept to Judaism: having been evidenced by the greater responsibility given to Abraham for his covenant, than to Noah for his, for example. However, it comes to the forefront in the transition from old Abrahamic covenant to new.\nAccording to Numbers 5:11-31, were a man of / living among the twelve tribes to accuse his wife of adultery upon her pregnancy, he was to take her to the priest, along with a guilt offering for his jealousy. She was to have her drink consecrated water with dust from the floor of the tabernacle—and then of the temple—and let God judge whether there was any adultery to be punished. If so, she would miscarry and be forever barren…which would equate to dooming her to financial destitution for the rest of her life.\nNow, of course, this was meant to be an impartial ruling from God himself, as He had commanded; and not the taking of God-given life by any human hands. Even so, this would have put an innocent, unborn fetus’s life at risk, for the sake of something greater.\nSo right here is at least a justification for inducing or risking a miscarriage for something greater: namely, to ensure the life of the expectant mother.\nThis is extremely important, because of anti-abortion legislation, and how it affects mothers in life-or-death situations because of a problematic pregnancy.\nPregnancies do not usually prevent themselves as high-risk until late in the term. Medical procedures that induce miscarriage—especially those in the late term—is precisely what many anti-abortion bills seek to criminalize. Yet these very bills cause doctors to refuse treatment to expectant mothers who are bleeding out, simply because they do not want to put their livelihood on the line. (By the way, this happens disproportionately more often to mothers who are not white, since they are assumed to be too poor to even afford the medical bill.)\nNow, it is argued that these bills serve not only as a way to preserve certain politicians’ pro-life voter base; but also as a way to preserve their capitalists’ donors’ power. After all, those with wealth and connections would always find a way to skirt any abortion laws.\nThey can also afford one of the longest-running disinformation wars of the last century of American politics: predating even the “War on Drugs” that vilified marijuana for its own unsavory purposes. The pro-life movement as we commonly know it has for decades been fueled by lie after lie after lie, supposedly to fight for something upheld to be true (i.e. a gospel-abiding argument against ending the life of God’s human creation).\nNaturally, these lies have resulted in distrust of the healthcare industry, to the point of many mothers’ reluctance to seek medical attention when they and/or their child truly need it. I even remember one congressman outrageously claiming that “[t]he body has ways to shut [pregnancies by rape] down”—and people who wanted to believe it did, at least enough that they can feel justified in their support of damaging “pro-life” policies.\n(I pity the poor girls and women who then had to deal with the assumptions of their families and neighbors that they ‘must’ve liked it’ too much, on top of already having been and being heavily traumatized.)\nThe donors paying for this propaganda could instead be paying for support and healthcare for low-income mothers and their children; counseling for mothers with no support system. If they cared about the sanctity of human life, they would be. However, they care more about twisting an also sacred religion to serve their power plays…and it shows.\nFurthermore, history has shown that as long as laws or agendas negatively affect women more than it does men; people of color than white people; etc., enough men / white people / ________ will still support those laws and agendas that hurt them, so that they can feel ‘better than.’\nGiven the overwhelming evidence for this as it comes into play with abortion legislation; and everything I have detailed above, I would warn people of the sinister motives behind this agenda.\nIn fact, I would warn against buying wholesale into the “pro-life” movement overall: it being far too tainted with bloodthirst of its own.\nIndeed, many are out to even put mothers to death for aborting a pregnancy where the fetus had a heartbeat, even if they did not have a brain or if carrying their pregnancy was literally killing their mother. Surely condemning to death someone who has turned to sin, is more weighty than doing that to a sinless soul.\nYet one does not even have to wish them or the operating physician the death penalty, to violate the teaching of John 8:1-11. Anyone who seeks to punish someone merely for different sins than their own brings guilt upon themselves.\nWhere the worldly sciences do not suffice to convince worldly people of a godly precept, we must be as patient with them as God is being with us all. Evangelism, then, must become our primary effort to preserve unborn human life. Not slander; not scare tactics. Not prejudice. Saving souls, thereby laying the foundation that Christ Himself has lain, so that they and we may continue to build.\nStill, that does not mean morally supporting the intentional killing of an unborn child for just any reason.\nIn fact, while many modern Jewish communities consider aborting a pregnancy by rape justifiable as an act of vengeance—which is actually the inverse of the message of that Numbers passage—Christians are expected to remain in touch with the impartiality and the grace that He commands of His people.\nThe grace of Christ means that we must not want to make any unfaithful wives of ours suffer miscarriage; bodily trauma; barrenness; and financial ruin. We must be willing to accept that they may have sinned against us, and to dole justice through forgiveness.\nThe impartiality of Christ has ruled that a sinner must not cast a single stone at another, lest they come under the same judgment. His impartiality also rules that the lives of newborns and the unborn are completely innocent. It rules that the infanticide of even somewhat sinful souls is so grave an offense; that it is even worth mentioning in the same breath as (further) corrupting them oneself, even in a metaphor (Mt. 18:6; Mk. 9:42).\nThe faithfulness of Christ rules that we must trust the Lord with our financial situation, and with our child’s life and upbringing. (The stories of Hagar, and of the widow and the olive oil, also teach us this.) He teaches us that He will provide…especially if we have the conviction and the audacity to ask for what we need.\nThe fact that the Son of God was explicitly made a man, and not an angelic being (Hebrews 2:5-18), shows that He has considered humanity special in our own right; and worth sparing.\nThe willingness of Mary when Gabriel told her of God’s plans for her and the child, teaches us that childrearing is both a blessing; and a responsibility that married women should bear if they can. (Paul also touches on this in 1 Timothy 2:15).\nI do not think I need to go on.\nBeing morally against inducing miscarriage without medical necessity, looks vastly different from being “pro-life” as our worldly politics would define it.\nWe should certainly not let the sword of the Spirit dull in our hands. The war against sin must still be waged…but never let us forget what we are waging it for. Righteousness; salvation; mercy; grace; compassion; the meeting of needs.\nThese and more are to what God is calling our attention.', 'upvote': 1, 'date': 'Apr 12, 2020'}, 1: {'view': 'error', 'user_name': 'Kristofer Walters', 'answer': '', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020'}, 2: {'view': 25, 'user_name': 'David Black', 'answer': '', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 15, 2020'}, 3: {'view': 23, 'user_name': 'Balakrishna Khandadhi', 'answer': 'Why do you believe in aboration, when you can prevent the conception itself to live real life situation certainly it is not your belief but forced to be believed situation created, may be possible rejection of God as the life is terminated by believing in abortion your life is also at risk take care to be happy in life.

In Exodus 21:22 it specifically states “If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.” But goes on to say in 23 that if she were to die, then they should be considered murderers.\nThird, the people I have known who have had to actually have abortions faced terrible situations.

In the Qur’an, Allah ta’ala uses three words to describe our hearts: qalb, fu’aad and sadr and as usual, the intricate meanings of these words are not captured in the translation.\nSo, what is their difference?\nQalb is the general word for heart. It comes from the root which means something that turns around and about and upside down. It is the nature of hearts that they are constantly changing, this is the normal state of our hearts. When Allah ta’ala refers to emaan and diseases of the heart, qalb is used.\nFu’aad is from the verb fa’ada meaning burning or a flame and lahmun fa’eed means a roasted meat on a fire. Fu’aad is used when the heart is inflamed with emotion, as they say, “in the heat of the moment.” Fu’aad is used in the Qur’an to describe the heart when it is engrossed in emotion: happiness, sadness, lust, frustration, anger or regret.\nMy favorite example of this is in suratul Qasas (28), Allah ta’ala says,\nوَأَصْبَحَ فُؤَادُ أُمِّ مُوسَىٰ فَارِغًا\nBut there came to be a void in the heart (Fu’aado) of the mother of Musa. (28:10)\nAllah ta’ala uses fu’aad to describe the heart of Umm Musa after putting her newborn into the Nile, as if it was about to leave her chest in her worry and sadness. Allah ta’ala says her fu’aad became faarigha, empty. She was in such an emotional state that she could not think of anything except Musa alayhi salaam. Then He says,\nإِن كَادَتْ لَتُبْدِي بِهِ لَوْلَا أَن رَّبَطْنَا عَلَىٰ قَلْبِهَا\nShe was almost going to disclose his (case), had We not strengthened her heart(Qalbiha). (28:10)\nAfter Allah ta’ala strengthened her heart out of His Mercy, when she regained her emaan, patience and trust in Him, her fu’aad became qalb.\nSadr takes the meaning of chest, and when Allah ta’ala eludes to motives or secrets, he uses sadr because it gives the illusion literally of a treasure chest: something hidden and boxed up.\nFor sad’r we can refer to Suratun Naas:\nالَّذِي يُوَسْوِسُ فِي صُدُورِ النَّاسِ\nThe one who whispers in the hearts of Mankind. (114: 5)\nShaytan does not make waswas (whispers) into our quloob, but rather he whispers in the chests of the people. There is a distinction because Allah ta’ala created the qalb as pure. The example of the heart is like a fort and the eyes/tongues/ears/hands are gates to the opening. Shaytan waits outside of this fort, attacking the openings trying to get in. Out of Allah’s Rahmah, He did not give Shaytan access to our quloob, but rather to our sudoor. It is us who let the gates open, not Shaytan.\nHope I was able to answer your question', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020'}, 1: {'view': 10, 'user_name': 'Javed Kaleem', 'answer': 'Arabic is rich language and it has many wordso of same meanings!

Then after this, hence why Jesus said that only the Father knows the day and the hour of His return is partly because - no singular unified calendar was used for a long time. Due to the New Covenant, the prophetic calendar switched with the transference of prophetic and spiritual maintenance and power from the Hebrews who rejected Christ, over to the Gentiles who received Him. Until such time of the remaining 7 years of history when Israel has an, “oh no!!!” moment and accepts Christ as the Messiah. So thus, 1993 years since his death on the cross which are incalculable to an exact day and hour to when this period of time ends due to there being no unified and agreed upon calendar - then time will return for the remaining 7 years, back to the Hebrew, lunar.\nI sure hope this helps? lol.

The test for canonical Scripture was to be that the writing was in accord with key writings already deemed canonical (such as Mark, Luke, and the Acts) and thus inspired by the Holy Spirit. This list was officially accepted by several Popes through the ages, including the final time of questioning (the Council of Trent in 1545–1563 — called the Council of the Counter-Reformation in some circles); this questioning was caused due to Martin Luther’s rejection of seven books of the Bible as non-canonical.\nPrior to 393, depending upon region, there were other writings accepted as Scriptural, but the western (Catholic) tradition discarded these as non-canonical. Other regions (such as those under sway of the Armenian Apostolic Church or the Ethiopian Orthodox Church) have differing canons which include additional books. In particular, the Armenian church includes writings known as the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, and the Ethiopian Church includes the writings known as Ethiopian Maccabees as well as portions of Josephus (a Jewish historian who lived during the Roman occupation of Judea).\nNow, if you consider Martin Luther a Pope, he did indeed de-canonify seven of the books of Scripture delineated by the Catholic Church, and relegate them to the Apocrypha or “deuter-canonical” (second Canon) position — books to be viewed as less canonical (if such can be imagined). His reason for doing so was that these seven books had not been originally written in Hebrew. This same methodology was used by the Jewish authorities in creating their canon of the Bible at the Council of Jamna (100AD or so). Luther also rejected — for doctrinal reasons — portions of 2 Maccabees, because the offending texts affirmed the existence of Purgatory. Martin’s rejection of the New Testament texts were eventually rejected in turn by the Lutheran Church itself.\nSo, it wasn’t a Pope who cleaned the Bible, so to speak; it was the founder of the Lutheran Church, Martin Luther, who did so.\nFragments of the “deutercanonical” Scriptures — written in Hebrew — were discovered at the Dead Sea in 1947, thus proving that Luther and the Jews had erred in rejecting the seven books on the basis of language alone.', 'upvote': 8, 'date': 'Apr 13, 2020'}, 1: {'view': 'error', 'user_name': 'Andrew Boyd', 'answer': '', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 13, 2020'}}, 'question_title': 'At dinner tonight a "cleaning of the Bible" of unpalatable passages was mentioned to have been done by a Pope.

Some translations, such as KJV, call him Simon the Canaanite, others say Simon the Zealot and Simon the Cananaean (presumably: from the village of Cana) also occurs. Matthew’s Gospel follows Mark in using the word Καναναῖον, while Luke says Ζηλωτὴν – the Zealot, or the zealous.\nBy referring to James and John as “The sons of thunder”, Mark is setting up a comparison in Mark 10:35–45 between these brothers and Castor and Polydeuces, sons of Zeus the thunderer. The authors of Matthew and Luke were unaware of this and thus saw no reason for the reference.\nMark's Gospel refers to Levi, son of Alphaeus, as a tax collector. However, for some reason, Mark never again refers to Levi, but introduces Matthew and James, son of Alphaeus, as disciples in the list of the twelve disciples (verses 3:14-19). There is no reason here to believe that the author of Mark was portraying Matthew as the tax collector or as the brother of James, son of Alphaeus. Because disciples are not supposed to just disappear when called by Jesus, the author of Matthew resolved this by not referring to Levi, but instead saying in the corresponding place in the text that the tax collector Jesus called was Matthew—creating a list that logically ought to refer to Matthew as son of Alphaeus and brother of James. Thus we have two essentially similar references to Jesus calling a tax collector to follow him, with names Levi and Matthew. Naturally the two were later thought to be exactly the same person.\nIt is curious that the authors of both Matthew and Luke seem to have been embarrassed by Mark’s use of the name Thaddaeus, the etymology of which is uncertain but may derive from the Aramaic` for ‘breasts’. Matthew resolves this by saying that his real name was Lebbaeus, which is probably derived from the Aramaic for ‘heart’. Luke resolves it by omitting the name altogether, making up the twelve by adding Judas the brother of James, whom John later refers to as “Judas not Iscariot”.", 'upvote': 5, 'date': 'Apr 15, 2020'}, 1: {'view': 8, 'user_name': 'Ken Jacobsen', 'answer': 'It was not, and remains to this day, not uncommon for people in occupied countries to adopt new names for protection….

When a scribe passed, ordinary people rose as a sign of respect. They were given the place of honor at important feasts and in synagogues.” They were generally "students of the Law” who teach the people and interprete the Law (Mark 1:22). Although they knew the Law and taught it to others, they themselves did not walk and live by the law.\nScribes, also called "lawyers" (Matthew 22:35; Mark 12:28; Luke 20:39), were highly respected class of religious leaders who often exhibited in public an arrogant righteousness. Majority of them belonged to the sect of the Pharisees, hence several passages of the New Testament speak of the "scribes of the Pharisees" (Mark 2:16; Luke 5:30; Acts 23:9).\nGotQuestions adds:\nThe scribes went beyond interpretation of Scripture, however, and added many man-made traditions to what God had said. They became professionals at spelling out the letter of the Law while ignoring the spirit behind it. Things became so bad that the regulations and traditions the scribes added to the Law were considered more important than the Law itself. This led to many confrontations between Jesus and the Pharisees and scribes. At the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus shocked His audience by declaring that the righteousness of the scribes was not enough to get anyone to heaven (Matthew 5:20). A large portion of Jesus’ sermon then dealt with what the people had been taught (by the scribes) and what God actually wanted (Matthew 5:21–48). Toward the end of Jesus’ ministry, He thoroughly condemned the scribes for their hypocrisy (Matthew 23).\n…Eventually, it was these same scribes who played a part in having Jesus arrested and crucified (Matthew 26:57; Mark 15:1; Luke 22:1–2).\nAccording to God\'s Word First, “Scribes still exist today.

Theoretically, governance is necessary to ensure proper coordination within the community, as well as speak on behalf of the community — essentially serve as their voice and help keep things moving while the rest of the community does their own thing. It doesn’t matter if we’re talking “representative of the tribe’s elders” or “president of the nation” or “prince of the region”, it still ends up being people deciding to give their collective power to their representatives, supposedly to be utilized for the benefit of the group… thus, a “representative of the government” would awkwardly mean, “representative of the people’s representatives.”\nNo religion would exist if there isn’t a community to guide and/or pray. Theoretically, faith is necessary to provide moral (social) and spiritual (emotional, mental) guidance to the rest of the community… good luck doing that without a community that believes in that religion at all. So a “representative of religion” would turn out to be “representative of a collection of ideas”, which compared to the representatives of a community — a representative of the people — doesn’t really seem all that important.\nObviously, there’s much more nuance and complications behind real life — this is merely an oversimplification, as representatives of religion are actually more like representatives of people whose community is built around religious beliefs, and representatives of government are actually more like representatives of the compromises between multiple communities (which technically makes them more important, but is dampened by the implied distancing between a single community in favor of multiple communities [including a completely separate circle of representatives, sometimes called “political parties”]), and this doesn’t cover the fact that humans tend to be within multiple communities at once.

Centuries ago, the Qur’an referred to this scientific theory.\n \nIt says when describing the creation of the heavens:\n“Then God turned to the creation of the heavens (the planets), when they were but a smoky substance.” (41:11)\n\n“Do the unbelievers not see that the heavens and the earth were joined together before we separated them, and that We brought all living things into existence from water? Why do they still not believe in God?” (21:30)\n \nThus the Qur’an unveils one of the great mysteries of nature: the planets were originally composed of smoky substance (mass of Sodium gas), and the separation of the planets from a huge object and then their separation from each other. Since at the time of revelation of the Qur’an, the general level of knowledge and science was extremely low, does this not constitute a proof of the heavenly nature of the Qur’an?\nb) Expansion of Universe\nOne of the most subtle discoveries in science concerns the expansion of universe, its tendency constantly to extend its boundaries. This was something completely unknown to the human being until the last century. This mystery is, however, mentioned by the Qur’an in the following terms, which again bear witness to its remarkable profundity when discussing such matters:\n \n“We created the heavens with Our strength and power, and constantly expand them”. (51:47)\nc) Force of Gravity\nWe know that before the time of Newton, that great scientific personality, no one was aware of the force of gravity. Newton proved that the falling of objects to earth, the rotation of the moon and the Venus, the motion of the planets, and other instances of attraction are all subject to the single law, the law of universal gravity.\n \nThe Qur’an describes the above mentioned gravitational force as ‘invisible pillars’:\n“God it is Who raised up the heavenly bodies to invisible pillars .....” (13:2).\n\nIn conveying this scientific truth, the Qur’an has used an expression that is comprehensible for the men of all ages. Are these ‘unseen pillars’, which prevent the planets from colliding with each other or falling, anything other than the mysterious and invisible force of universal gravity, a law to which the Creator of the universe has subjected all of the heavenly bodies?\nd) Production of Milk in Animals\nThe Qur’an describes the factors which give rise to milk in animals in a way that is entirely compatible with the data of modern science. This is what God’s book has to say:\n“There is in truth for you a lesson in your animals and flocks. We give you to drink a pure milk derived from that which is contained in their bodies, from the merging of what is held in their intestines with blood. The drinking of that is then made easy for those who drink it.” (16:66).\n\nDr. Bucaille writes in his book:\n“From a scientific point of view, physiological notions must be called upon to grasp the meaning of this verse. The substances that ensure the general nutrition of the body come from chemical transformations which occur along the length of the digestive tract. These substances come from the contents of the intestine. On arrival in the intestine at the appropriate stage of chemical transformation, they pass through its wall and towards the systemic circulation (of blood)...... This very precise concept is the result of the discoveries made in the chemistry and physiology of the digestive system. It was totally unknown at the time of the Prophet Muhammad and has been understood only in recent times.”\ne) In Pairs\nIt is only recently that researchers have come aware of insemination in plants and learned that every living being including plants comes into existence as the result of the merging of a male and female parts.\n \nIn verses that are totally free of ambiguity, the noble Qur’an, sets forth clearly the principle of gender in the gender world, together with the existence of male and female parts even in plants.\n“Do they not look at the earth, where we created the plants in pairs”. (26:7).\nf) Role of Wind\nThe Qur’an also mentions the role and operation of an important factor in the bringing of things to fruition: the wind.\n“We have sent the winds as a means of insemination and impregnation, and then sent down rain from the heavens.” (15:22).\n\nIn this verse, the Qur’an unveils another a great mystery of creation, the fundamental role played by the wind in the fertilization of plants.\ng) Light in the Moon is merely a Reflection\nIt is known that the sun is a star that generates intense heat and light by its internal combustion, and that the moon which does not give off light itself, merely reflects the light received from the sun.\n \nThe Qur’an testifies the above fact:\n“Blessed is the One Who placed the constellations in heaven and placed in it a lamp (SIRAJ) and a moon, giving light (MUNIIRA)”. (25:61)\n \nHere the moon is defined as a body that gives reflection of light (Muniira), while the sun is compared to a blazing lamp or torch (Siraj).\nh) High Altitude\nIt is infact a highly common place reflection on the discomfort experienced at high altitude, which increases the higher one climbs, that is expressed in the Qur’an:\n \n“Those whom God wills to guide, He opens their breast to Islam. While those whom He wills to let straying, He makes their breath closed and constricted, as if they had to climb up the skies”. (6:125)\n\nWho informed the Prophet that by climbing up in the skies, the pressure increases and breathing becomes difficult?\ni) Honey Bees\nConcerning bees, the Qur’an says:\n“Your Lord inspired the (female) bee, choose your dwelling in the hills, in the trees and in what (man) build. Eat of all fruit and follow the ways of your Lord in humility. From within their bodies comes a liquid of different colours where is cure for men”. (16:68-69)\n \nThe Qur’an refers that the worker-bees who are searching for food are females. The verbs used in Arabic refer to female bees. This is very amazing. For all along, until only recently, people imagined that the “soldier-bees” were males.\nj) Development of the Embryo\nThe Qur’anic description of certain stages in the development of the embryo corresponds exactly to what we today know about it. After ‘the thing which clings’, the Qur’an informs us that the embryo passes through the stage of ‘chewed flesh’, then tissue appears and is clad in flesh:\n \n“We fashioned the thing which clings into a chewed lump of flesh and We fashioned the chewed flesh into bones, and We clothed the bones with intact flesh”. (23:14).\n \nIt was only during the nineteenth century that people had a slightly clearer view of this question.\n \nAll the afore mentioned and many other modern scientific concepts found abundantly in the Glorious Qur’an, that was revealed 14 centuries ago, with utmost accuracy and free from any error, prove beyond any iota of doubt the divine source of its revelation.\nUrl\nSome Brief Examples of Scientific Data in the Qur’an', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 15, 2020'}, 2: {'view': 16, 'user_name': 'Muhammad Jamil', 'answer': 'Dear you may read article by Dr Zakir Nail with complete reference and short interpretation of science and Quran.\nQuran and Modern science By Dr. Zakir Naik', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020'}}, 'question_title': 'Which verses of the Holy Quran indicate the discovery of science?

The only thing I would add is letting go and let God while I remember that “We know that all things work for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.”(Rom 8:28)\n* - - - - - - - - - - - - *\n{1} “Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; then he went up to the temple of the Lord, and spreading it out before him, he prayed in the Lord’s presence: ‘O Lord, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim! You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. Incline your ear, O Lord, and listen! Open your eyes, O Lord, and see! Hear the words of Sennacherab which he sent to taunt the living God. Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands, and cast their gods into the fire; they destroyed them because they were not gods, but the work of human hands, wood and stone. Therefore, O Lord, our God, save us from the power of this man, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone, O Lord, are God.”(2 Kings 19:14 – 19)\n* - - - - - - - - - - - - *\n{2} First, Hezekiah came to this prayer having already done all that he could: he had followed God’s way in the way he lived his life; he had governed the people with justice so they were likely to remain loyal to him; he had already stripped both palace and temple of gold and silver, sacrificing what was of less importance to save his people; he had listened to the messengers and read the letter. To use St. Augustine’s words, he had worked as if it all depended on him. He did not just presume God was going to get him out of this predicament. He did what he could.\nIt is important in times of desperation to get ourselves right with God if our own sin has been a part of our desperate situation and/or to recall that we are God’s children and can count on Him. It is good for us to use our human, practical capacity to problem solve as much as we can.\nSecond, Hezekiah faced the situation. There was no denial in him. He did not hide in the palace or attempt to escape. If we want God’s help, we must face the situation. No denial. No hiding behind blaming or using something that numbs pain. No escaping.\nThird, Hezekiah went to where God was. He went to the temple. We can go to church. We can kneel before the Tabernacle where Jesus waits for us. While God hears us wherever we pray, there is something good about going before the Lord’s physical Presence.\nThen Hezekiah addressed God with both deference and confidence. He honored God and trusted Him. He talked to God and poured out his heart. He gave God the cold, hard facts. He also presented his case as a way to give God glory and victory. Using this way of addressing God we begin by recalling and naming that which is good in the other person and in our shared relationship, we put the conversation on a foundation of mutuality and love. We open the door for Truth, Compassion, and Fidelity to enter the conversation. Then it is important to express all that is in mind and heart. Pour out your soul as Hezekiah did. But do it in a way that is as much from the other’s point of view as your own. That isn’t a “sell job.” It is an act of emotional and mental respect which touches the heart of the other—whether that other is family member or God.\nHezekiah then left the solution to God. He did not tell God what to do. He did not try to limit God by his human reasoning or make God his servant. He put forth his case and let God be God. He let God come up with a solution.\nWhile God tells us to ask Him for what we need (“Give us our daily bread,” “Lead us not into temptation”), it seems to me that in prayers of desperation something different is required. We must let go and leave the solution totally up to God. This feels like jumping off a cliff, but such a jump is required. There is a danger that, being desperate, we can try to command God—which would make God our servant instead of our God. God is not a servant. He serves—but as God, from His infinite wisdom and love. There is also a danger we may not see a solution God may give because we are so focused on the solution we can imagine.\nBy Mary Ortwein, 6/21/2016: Tuesday, 6/21/16 – How to Pray in Desperation', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020'}, 2: {'view': 91, 'user_name': 'Maureen Harlacher', 'answer': 'When a person has a personal relationship with Jesus, he give peace unspeakable.', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 13, 2020'}, 3: {'view': 128, 'user_name': 'Bruce Can', 'answer': 'If God is for you.

Such words and phrases as ‘continuance of being’, ‘perpetual existence’, ‘incapable of dissolution’ and ‘incorruptible’ began to appear in so-called Christian writings. These had come straight from Plato, the Greek philosopher, all those years before Jesus. Other phrases used were ‘the soul to remain by itself immortal’, and ‘an immortal nature’. It was taught that this is how God made us. But this idea derives from philosophy, not divine inspiration. There are no such words in the Bible.\nIt was Athenagorus, a Christian, but whose teachings, according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, were strongly tinged with Platonism, who had introduced the teaching of an immortal soul into Christianity.

He meets very few. He has set a ‘Quota’ for it.\n2-Read below which is written based on my experience. The gist is that God does meet with quite a few persons. God is our creator and is nearest to us and therefore, each one of us has a direct and special connection with Him. It is due to this reason that He meets with those whose time for it has arrived and the beauty is that no intermediary is required for it.\n3-The following conditions are a must to meet with God.\n3A-Do not assume any shape for God. Wait and accept the face which God shows. He is shapeless, is present everywhere and is all powerful and all physical happenings are His doing though there is a method for it. He will show a face which may be unique to the seeker and not repeated to others. Worship and pray to this shape for God in future. Don’t be surprised on this. To get an answer, ask this question to self “When God makes billions and billions of human and other species, why would he show only one face to everyone when He does not have a permanent face?”\n3B-SO, BELIEVE IN A SHAPELESS GOD. Generally people meet with God’s officers, angels and spirits, who have known faces, and consider it to be the end of their journey to God. Difference in these meetings is that God meets only consciously and not in dream (ref. Revelation 12 in the link below). Meeting these personalities is also a good achievement but should not be the end for those who wish to meet with God. God’s majesty is understood well only after meeting with Him and, it only, leads to a blissful life thereafter and that God listens much more to such exalted human beings.\n3C-Taking & practicing God’s Mantra “I Will Become A Proper Human Being” is most desirable to go up in the Scale of Humanity, the only scale used by God to evaluate us. More may be read in Revelation 14 in the link being given below. When one reaches upward of 75% in this scale, God’s grace becomes apparent. This measurement is explained in the link.\n3D-Meeting with God becomes possible only after the usual weaknesses of human beings are won over to the extent of 90% and mind is also filled up with more positive thoughts. These weaknesses are; anger, revenge, jealousy, bad manners, arrogance, usurping someone else’s share out of greed, etc.\n3E-Though self realization of God is possible while pursuing some work for earnings, full or part time, meeting with God is not possible with this. One needs to be free from such activities while pursuing meeting with God.\n4-The Quota system, written at para 1 above, could be understood by reading para R22.1 & .2 of the Revelation 22 of the New Path. The New Path is God given through 25 Revelations and is not connected with any existing faith or religion or scripture or saint or guru. I have its personal experience. Its link is—RK Sharma's answer to What are few good Revelations in different religions or told by those who met God?—These paras are quoted below:\n5—-QUOTE—\nRevelation 22—“Those whom God gives Darshan (meeting God) are spiritual persons but not the special souls.”\nR22.1-With consistent efforts, certain persons rise so high as proper human beings that God rewards them with His Darshan. They are simple people. If rich, they do not show off. If poor, then not so poor that they do not have the basic comforts of life. God, at the present time, is keeping one among ten million people whom He has met. Out of these 760 people, at present, very few are told to work among the masses. Most of them have to work subtly with those who come into contact with them, based on the instructions received from God from time to time. However, sometimes, God uses them for some great work also. These matters are between them and God, and others may not come to know of it or understand it, if told. Since they are not allowed to work among the masses, God keeps other persons of high spiritual stature for this job who are five times of the number of those who have met with God. They have not met with God but have self realized Him. Their number is one among two million people (3,800 at present). Their spiritual state is just below those who have met with God.\nR22.3-With the present small number of only 760 persons who have met with God, one need not feel depressed that his turn may never come. Though, about 10% of these live more than twenty years after meeting with God, 10% of those, i.e., 76 people, live less than one year; meaning that 76 new people are added every year. Much more are added every 2-5 years, and so on. So, many people may get the chance to meet God while still keeping the overall number at 760 at any given time.\n—-UNQUOTE—\n6-Above explains, esp. para 3, that only very few happen to meet with God. They are the persons who, besides meeting other conditions, are very determined to meet with God. So, it can be seen that meeting with God, consciously is ruled out for those who, in the present incarnation, do not believe in God or have got the blessings of an Officer of God/angel/spirit or believe that they can themselves become God or believe that the meeting is possible only after death. As anyone can see, such beliefs would not allow them to think of meeting with God or ‘try’ to meet with God. This clearly means that they are destined not to meet with God in this incarnation.\n7-If, by chance, a person or few from among such groups as mentioned at para 6 above had pursued God separately and met with Him then they would not have been believed and would also have been ostracized from the group. If history is seen, many such examples would be found, proving that meeting with God is ‘one to one affair’ between the seeker and God. Now take another view. Had such groups accepted the achievement of such individuals and included the ‘path to God traversed by them‘ in their books, how enlightening and helpful it would have been for the genuine seekers? But, here also, it was God’s design to be what actually happened.\n8-Nevertheless, all human beings have been blessed by God to have a theory of their own or some beliefs. They follow and depend upon these and live through their present life, to some extent, with pleasure.

For two millennia, people around the world have been observing it with traditions and practices that are both religious and secular in nature. Christians celebrate Christmas Day as the anniversary of the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, a spiritual leader whose teachings form the basis of their religion. Popular customs include exchanging gifts, decorating Christmas trees, attending church, sharing meals with family and friends and, of course, waiting for Santa Claus to arrive. December 25–Christmas Day–has been a federal holiday in the United States since 1870.\nThe middle of winter has long been a time of celebration around the world. Centuries before the arrival of the man called Jesus, early Europeans celebrated light and birth in the darkest days of winter. Many peoples rejoiced during the winter solstice, when the worst of the winter was behind them and they could look forward to longer days and extended hours of sunlight.\nIn Scandinavia, the Norse celebrated Yule from December 21, the winter solstice, through January. In recognition of the return of the sun, fathers and sons would bring home large logs, which they would set on fire. The people would feast until the log burned out, which could take as many as 12 days. The Norse believed that each spark from the fire represented a new pig or calf that would be born during the coming year.\nThe end of December was a perfect time for celebration in most areas of Europe. At that time of year, most cattle were slaughtered so they would not have to be fed during the winter. For many, it was the only time of year when they had a supply of fresh meat. In addition, most wine and beer made during the year was finally fermented and ready for drinking.\nIn Germany, people honored the pagan god Oden during the mid-winter holiday. Germans were terrified of Oden, as they believed he made nocturnal flights through the sky to observe his people, and then decide who would prosper or perish. Because of his presence, many people chose to stay inside.\nIn Rome, where winters were not as harsh as those in the far north, Saturnalia—a holiday in honor of Saturn, the god of agriculture—was celebrated. Beginning in the week leading up to the winter solstice and continuing for a full month, Saturnalia was a hedonistic time, when food and drink were plentiful and the normal Roman social order was turned upside down. For a month, slaves would become masters. Peasants were in command of the city. Business and schools were closed so that everyone could join in the fun. Also around the time of the winter solstice, Romans observed Juvenalia, a feast honoring the children of Rome. In addition, members of the upper classes often celebrated the birthday of Mithra, the god of the unconquerable sun, on December 25. It was believed that Mithra, an infant god, was born of a rock. For some Romans, Mithra’s birthday was the most sacred day of the year.\nIn the early years of Christianity, Easter was the main holiday; the birth of Jesus was not celebrated. In the fourth century, church officials decided to institute the birth of Jesus as a holiday. Unfortunately, the Bible does not mention date for his birth (a fact Puritans later pointed out in order to deny the legitimacy of the celebration). Although some evidence suggests that his birth may have occurred in the spring (why would shepherds be herding in the middle of winter?), Pope Julius I chose December 25. It is commonly believed that the church chose this date in an effort to adopt and absorb the traditions of the pagan Saturnalia festival. First called the Feast of the Nativity, the custom spread to Egypt by 432 and to England by the end of the sixth century.\nBy the end of the eighth century, the celebration of Christmas had spread all the way to Scandinavia. Today, in the Greek and Russian orthodox churches, Christmas is celebrated 13 to 14 days after the 25th. This is because Western churches use the Gregorian Calendar, while Eastern Churches use the Julian Calendar, which is 13 to 14 days behind the Gregorian Calendar. Both Western and Eastern churches celebrate Epiphany or Three Kings Day 12 days after their own respective Christmases. This is the day it is believed that the three wise men finally found Jesus in the manger.\nBy holding Christmas at the same time as traditional winter solstice festivals, church leaders increased the chances that Christmas would be popularly embraced, but gave up the ability to dictate how it was celebrated. By the Middle Ages, Christianity had, for the most part, replaced pagan religion. On Christmas, believers attended church, then celebrated raucously in a drunken, carnival-like atmosphere similar to today’s Mardi Gras. Each year, a beggar or student would be crowned the “lord of misrule” and eager celebrants played the part of his subjects. The poor would go to the houses of the rich and demand their best food and drink. If owners failed to comply, their visitors would most likely terrorize them with mischief. Christmas became the time of year when the upper classes could repay their real or imagined “debt” to society by entertaining less fortunate citizens.\nIn the early 17th century, a wave of religious reform changed the way Christmas was celebrated in Europe. When Oliver Cromwell and his Puritan forces took over England in 1645, they vowed to rid England of decadence and, as part of their effort, cancelled Christmas. By popular demand, Charles II was restored to the throne and, with him, came the return of the popular holiday. The pilgrims, English separatists that came to America in 1620, were even more orthodox in their Puritan beliefs than Cromwell. As a result, Christmas was not a holiday in early America. From 1659 to 1681, the celebration of Christmas was actually outlawed in Boston. Anyone exhibiting the Christmas spirit was fined five shillings. By contrast, in the Jamestown settlement, Captain John Smith reported that Christmas was enjoyed by all and passed without incident. After the American Revolution, English customs fell out of favor, including Christmas. In fact, Christmas wasn’t declared a federal holiday until June 26, 1870.\nIt wasn’t until the 19th century that Americans began to embrace Christmas. Americans re-invented Christmas, and changed it from a raucous carnival holiday into a family-centered day of peace and nostalgia. But what about the 1800s piqued American interest in the holiday? The early 19th century was a period of class conflict and turmoil. During this time, unemployment was high and gang rioting by the disenchanted classes often occurred during the Christmas season. In 1828, the New York city council instituted the city’s first police force in response to a Christmas riot. This catalyzed certain members of the upper classes to begin to change the way Christmas was celebrated in America.\nIn 1819, best-selling author Washington Irving wrote The Sketchbook of Geoffrey Crayon, gent., a series of stories about the celebration of Christmas in an English manor house. The sketches feature a squire who invited the peasants into his home for the holiday. In contrast to the problems faced in American society, the two groups mingled effortlessly. In Irving’s mind, Christmas should be a peaceful, warm-hearted holiday bringing groups together across lines of wealth or social status. Irving’s fictitious celebrants enjoyed “ancient customs,” including the crowning of a Lord of Misrule. Irving’s book, however, was not based on any holiday celebration he had attended – in fact, many historians say that Irving’s account actually “invented” tradition by implying that it described the true customs of the season.\nAlso around this time, English author Charles Dickens created the classic holiday tale, A Christmas Carol. The story’s message-the importance of charity and good will towards all humankind-struck a powerful chord in the United States and England and showed members of Victorian society the benefits of celebrating the holiday. The family was also becoming less disciplined and more sensitive to the emotional needs of children during the early 1800s. Christmas provided families with a day when they could lavish attention-and gifts-on their children without appearing to “spoil” them.\nAs Americans began to embrace Christmas as a perfect family holiday, old customs were unearthed. People looked toward recent immigrants and Catholic and Episcopalian churches to see how the day should be celebrated. In the next 100 years, Americans built a Christmas tradition all their own that included pieces of many other customs, including decorating trees, sending holiday cards and gift-giving. Although most families quickly bought into the idea that they were celebrating Christmas how it had been done for centuries, Americans had really re-invented a holiday to fill the cultural needs of a growing nation.\nThe legend of Santa Claus can be traced back to a monk named St. Nicholas who was born in Turkey around 280 A.D.. St. Nicholas gave away all of his inherited wealth and traveled the countryside helping the poor and sick, becoming known as the protector of children and sailors. St. Nicholas first entered American popular culture in the late 18th century in New York, when Dutch families gathered to honor the anniversary of the death of “Sint Nikolaas” (Dutch for Saint Nicholas), or “Sinter Klaas” for short. “Santa Claus” draws his name from this abbreviation.\nIn 1822, Episcopal minister Clement Clarke Moore wrote a Christmas poem called “An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas,” more popularly known today by it’s first line: “‘Twas The Night Before Christmas.” The poem depicted Santa Claus as a jolly man who flies from home to home on a sled driven by reindeer to deliver toys. The iconic version of Santa Claus as a jolly man in red with a white beard and a sack of toys was immortalized in 1881, when political cartoonist Thomas Nast drew on Moore's poem to create the image of Old Saint Nick we know today.\n12/17/2019: History of Christmas", 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 13, 2020'}}, 'question_title': 'Did the apostles celebrate Christmas?', 'question_author': 'Pat Foley'}, 623: {'no_of_view': '505', 'no_of_follower': 2, 'create_time': 'Apr 15, 2020', 'topic_list': [], 'answer_count': 1, 'respond': {0: {'view': 11, 'user_name': 'Vern Wall', 'answer': "What are some tips on evangelizing to the youth?\nI suggest you don’t try.

And I have Jewish friends there.\nI studied in Montreal and lived 10 years in Montreal, in Cote des Neiges, which is near the Cote St Luc neighborhood, where there is a big Moroccan Jewish community.\nSo I can safely say that I know a lot this community. And the vast majority of them are not Islamophobic at all, but they are actually very fond of Muslims, especially Moroccans. There are some who are Islamophobic, or who are having a lot of Anti-Muslims rhetorics on social media, but they are merely replying to a much bigger anti-Jewish rhetoric on social media from Muslims themselves. I can safely say that there are probably more Moroccan Muslims being deeply antisemitic than Moroccan Jews being islamophobic.\nNow, to speak about Zionism: we can say that most Jews from the Arab world tend to be more Zionists because they were stuck with nationalism that excluded them from the nation (Arab nationalism) and the fact that most Arab countries who became independent embraced Islam as a state religion. So Jews were de-facto excluded from both politics and the nation. Zionism, on the other hand, was a nationalist ideology that was designed for them as Jews, even if, at the beginning of it, it didn’t respect their culture and religious identity. So when Morocco became independent, the leading political party, the Istiqlal, decided to rout for Morocco to be an Arab-Muslim state. Islam was institutionalized as the religion of the state. This led to the creation of a modern society where people were Muslims before being Moroccan. If Morocco had decided to embrace secularism, it would have been different.\nAlso, the fact that political Arabization happened, which means replacing all French by only Arabic made the Jews foreign in their own country. Because Jews were educated in Jewish schools since the late 19th century under the Universal Israelite Alliance, a French institution, a lot of them who were working in administration got jobless. And the hostility towards them during the Arab-Israeli wars, and the fact that they were perceived as ‘’enemies from the inside’’ made most of them renounce participation in the building of modern Morocco, and to move to Israel. Because, if they stayed in Morocco, they would always be viewed as a tolerated minority. So it was quite logical for them to connect with Zionism, and with the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, now Israel.\nBut are all Moroccan Jews Zionists? No. Most of them are, but some of the biggest Jewish advocates of Palestinian rights are also Moroccans.\nAndré Azoulay, the senior advisor of the king of Morocco, Mohammed VI, is a big defender of Palestinian rights. Here you see him with Mahmoud Abbas.\nMichele Sibony is a Moroccan peace activist who is deeply involved in Palestinian rights. She is the vice-president of the Union juive française pour la paix (French Jewish Union for Peace).\nSimone Bitton, is Moroccan-Israeli filmmaker, and peace activist who is also involved in Palestinian rights.\nThe late Edmond Amran El Maleh was a Moroccan writer who was very critical towards Zionism, and was a fierce defender of the Palestinian rights.\nSion Assidon is a Moroccan activist (I personally find him extremist) who is one of the voices of BDS in Morocco. He is fighting against the normalization of the relation between Morocco and Israel.\nAbraham Serfaty was a Moroccan political dissident (he was against the precedent King Hassan II), who was also a fierce anti-Zionist.\nLate Israeli filmmaker Ronit Elkabetz (born from Moroccan Jewish immigrants), was known for her fights for the rights of Palestinians, and peace between them and Israel.\nIsraeli actress Yael Abecassis (also the daughter of Moroccan Jewish parents, her mother Raymonde is a famous folk-singer of Moroccan music) is also known for her peace activism for peace with Palestinians.\nJacob Cohen is a Moroccan writer who is also known for his anti-Zionism and for being very critical towards normalization between Israel and Morocco.\nKathy Wazana is a Moroccan Canadian filmmaker and activist, who is also very critical of Israel and who is anti-Zionist.\nand there are so many more.\nSo your question needs more nuances.', 'upvote': 8, 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020'}, 1: {'view': 41, 'user_name': 'Ronald Weinger', 'answer': 'While leading a locked-down life I read about the Jews of Morocco.

I mean no other work of fiction comes close to the Holy Bible. No other written works have the longevity and sheer quantity of printed copies like that of the Holy Bible. Take any secular works, and they haven’t been around as long as the Bible.\nThe authors of the four gospels had nothing to gain monetarily from writing them. The apostles some whom wrote the books in the New Testament, were persecuted, arrested and executed. So they didn’t gain much from teaching and continuing Jesus’ earthly ministry. In fact quite the opposite. They even recorded how they were fearful and fled after Jesus was arrested. Peter denied Jesus three times in order to save his own life.\nThe Holy Bible itself is proof. Sure there will be some individuals who will scorn this answer. But the truth is that if you don’t believe in the accuracy of the Bible, then its time to move onwards. Find something else of interest. But the Bible is proof of that Jesus is who He claimed to be. Written over hundreds of years, by several different authors, the Bible has a consistent message. Salvation by grace through faith. The Bible is not filled with accounts of perfect people. It is filled with flawed people. They made mistakes. Not once, but many times. They were imperfect.\nIf you don’t believe in the truth in scripture, then nothing will convince you that Jesus is real. We have no artifacts that can be verified. No DNA samples to verify if Jesus existed.

Being saved is the primer needed to unlock the truths in the Bible. Without this primer, scripture will not be easily understood. Just like math, we need to accept the fundamentals. We need to understand how to add, subtract, multiply and divide. Then we can pursue the understanding of more advanced mathematical concepts.\nIn order to understand the Bible, one must be saved.

We can then use them as a ‘measuring stick’ compared to Jimmy Swaggart whom your brother claims is a true man of God.\nLet’s start with Noah. Genesis 6:9 says: “Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God”. Noah was also very obedient and verse 22 said: “Noah did everything just as God commanded him”. Noah as a man of God was righteous, blameless and obedient.\nNext let’s take a look at Abraham. Hebrews 11:8–9 said that “By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place he was to receive as an inheritance, he went out although not knowing where he was going. By faith, he lived as a foreigner in the land of the promise…,living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him with the very same promise”. Abraham, as a man of God, left the prosperous city of Ur in obedience to God’s command to get out from his relatives. He went out ‘even not knowing where he was going’. From the city, he lived in tents and became a nomad. His faith was so strong that he was willing to sacrifice everything in obedience to God’s command.\nNow, let’s take a leapt to the apostle Paul. 1 Corinthians 16:1 tells us that ‘he has authority to give instructions and directions to other Christians’. However, he did not use his authority to benefit himself but to minister to others. He said in 1 Corinthians 9:18: “What then is my pay? It is the opportunity to preach the good news without charging anyone. That’s why I never demand my rights when I preach the good news”. He also wrote in Acts 20:33–35 saying: “I have desired no man’s silver or gold or clothing. You yourselves know that these hands provided for my own needs and the needs of those with me”. Paul as a man of God, ministered to others for free without charge and provided for his own needs.\nNow, how righteous, blameless and obedient Jimmy Swaggart is compared to Noah? Is he willing to sacrifice everything in obedience to God’s command just like Abraham? Though having authority over others, does he minister to them for free and endeavored to provide for his own needs just like Paul was?', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 12, 2020'}, 1: {'view': 'error', 'user_name': 'Eugene Mormon', 'answer': '', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 12, 2020'}}, 'question_title': 'Is TV Pentecostal evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, as my brother declares, a true man of God?', 'question_author': None}, 673: {'no_of_view': '1,399', 'no_of_follower': 2, 'create_time': 'Apr 14, 2020', 'topic_list': ['Ancient Hindu Epics and Literature', 'Mahabharata (Hindu epic)', 'Mythology', 'Epics of India', 'Hinduism', 'Religion', 'Personal Question'], 'answer_count': 'error', 'respond': {}, 'question_title': 'Why am I so attached to the Mahabharata?

He was the son of Ravana, the King of Lanka. Indrajit means the conqueror of Indra (Hindu God). He is also known by the name of Meghanad or Meghnad.\nRavana, Indrajit played a major role. Before every battle Indrajit used to perform a Yagna, which made him invincible in battle. He succeeded in defeating Lakshmana twice and Lord Rama once in battle. But finally Lakshmana with the help of Vibhishana disrupted his Yagna and engaged in a battle with him for three days and three nights in which Indrajit was killed.\nIndrajit was born to Mandodari and Ravana. When he was born his birth cry sounded like a thunder due to which he was named Meghanada. In one of the incidents he managed to defeat the King of Devas, Indra. After this incident he came to be known as Indrajit, which means the conqueror of Indra.\nShukra, the guru of the demons guided Indrajit towards possessing several divine celestial weapons such as Pashupatastra, Brahmastra and Vaishnavastra at a very young age. Indrajit had a wife named Sulochana, who was the daughter of Shesha Naga, the king of serpents.\nIn a battle known as Devasura Sangram, Indrajit defeated Indra, tied him up and mounted him on his celestial chariot. But soon Lord Brahma intervened and asked Indrajit to release him. Indrajit obliged to this and was asked by Brahma to wish for any boon.\nIndrajit asked for immortality, but Lord Brahma told him that this was against the law of nature, therefore Indrajit was granted with another boon. According to this boon Indrajit would never be defeated in a battle until his Yagna before the battle is disturbed or destroyed. Lakshmana took help of Vibhishana and disturbed Indrajit’s Yagna. Lakshmana finally killed Indrajit and emerged victorious.\nIndrajit joined the battle when all his brothers had been killed by Rama and his army. His father, Ravana, had been humiliated in the battle by Rama, and his paternal uncle Kumbhakarna had been killed by Rama. Indrajit fought with Rama's army for three days.\nAs the Valmiki Ramayana quotes, upon his Yagna being destroyed by the armies of Lakshmana, Indrajit became enraged and stormed out of the Temple Cave. Seeing his uncle Vibhishana (who had abandoned Ravana and joined Rama) at Lakshmana's side multiplied Indrajit's fury manifold. He vowed to kill his uncle Vibhisana along with Lakshmana once and for all, letting loose the Yama-astra which he had been conserving for punishing Vibhishana's perceived treason\n. At this juncture, Lakshmana protected Vibhsana, countering the Yama-astra owing to an earlier warning by Kubera. Fierce battle ensued, and unable to injure Lakshmana by normal means, Indrajit resorted to the use of the three Supreme Weapons (Brahmastra, Pashupatastra, and Vaishnavastra) on Lakshmana.\nTo Indrajit's great shock and dismay, each of the three weapons refused to even touch Lakshmana, with the Vaishnavastra circumambulating Lakshmana before disappearing.\nRealization dawned on Indrajit that Lakshmana was no ordinary human as he and his father had perceived. Indrajit vanished briefly from the battlefield, returning to Ravana at the royal palace, and reported the developments, proposing that his father make peace with Rama and protect the demon race from further decimation.\nRavana, blinded with pride, was unrelenting and annoyed, and even suggested that Indrajit was a coward having fled the battlefield. This accusation provoked Indrajit who briefly lost his temper, striking fear even at the mighty Ravana's heart before apologising and clarifying to his father that his primary duty as a son was to serve his father's best interests, and that even in the face of death, he'd never abandon Ravana. Preparing to go back on the battle and knowing that he indeed faced death at the hands of a heavenly incarnation, Indrajit bade his last goodbyes to his parents and his wife.\nHe returned to the battlefield and fiercely fought Lakshmana with all his skill at both warfare, and sorcery. Lakshmana was unstoppable, and slew Indrajit by beheading him with the Aindrastra\nThe verse invoked by Lakshmana to slay Indrajit is considered by the devout as one of the moola mantras of the Ramayana:\ndharmaatmaa satyasandhashcha raamo daasharathiryadi |pauruShe chaapratidvandvastadenaM jahi raavaNim\n“[O! my dear arrow!] If Rama, the son of Dasaratha, is ever firm on the staying the path of Dharma and Satya, and is second to none in his prowess, go forth and destroy this Indrajit.”\nIndrajit is said to have one of the few warriors who possessed all the three celestial weapons\nHe was the strongest warrior in the war and some epics and purana depicts him the greatest warrior of all time\nHe was the only atimaharathi warrior in both Ramayan and Mahabharat who is capable of fighting 12 Maharathi except shri ram and Krishna", 'upvote': 495, 'date': 'Apr 15, 2020'}, 1: {'view': 'error', 'user_name': 'Vijay Thapak', 'answer': '', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 15, 2020'}}, 'question_title': 'Who was Indrajeet according to Valmiki Ramyan?', 'question_author': 'Ankitsingh Bisht'}, 703: {'no_of_view': '637', 'no_of_follower': 2, 'create_time': 'Apr 13, 2020', 'topic_list': [], 'answer_count': 3, 'respond': {0: {'view': 26, 'user_name': 'Jack Silitoe', 'answer': 'Come on.

Though the KJV has been around for some 400 years, much has changed in the understanding of the documents that make up the Bible. There is also the English used in 1611 that has evolved since then, especially idioms that were very prevalent back then are no longer in use today and vice versa.\nPreferences are fine, but when the books of Tobit, Judith, Wisdom etc. are being reviewed, one will have to look to the Catholic Bibles to find them.\n* - - - - - - - - - - - - *\nThe Church doesn’t forbid Catholics from having any version of the Bible on their bookshelf. In fact, the Church as a whole doesn’t pronounce that the King James Version of the Bible isn’t recognized. But Catholics may find it helpful to use the version of the Bible that is used at Mass: the New American Bible.\nYou might notice that in bookstores, there are sections for Catholic Bibles and Protestant Bibles. Why are there so many translations? First and foremost, the obvious reason that we have translations is that the Bible wasn’t written in English! It was written in Hebrew (Old Testament) or Greek (New Testament), and no original manuscripts exist. What we have are manuscripts that are copies of the originals, and, unfortunately, these copies often contain variations. That makes translating the Bible accurately into any language (an already difficult task) even more complex. Some translations aim for a literal translation while others aim to either find a contemporary equivalence or paraphrase. As a result, no one translation is perfect. It all depends on what you’re looking for.\nThe King James Version of the Bible, completed in 1611, sought to be a precise translation coupled with a majestic literary style. It should be noted, however, that the editors of the King James Version were instructed by King James I of England to make sure that the translation was in harmony with the theology of the Church of England. The King James Version was looked to as the standard English translation of the Bible for almost 400 years.\nAlthough the King James Version may sound very lofty and dignified in its language (thou, thee, ye, thine), it can be very difficult to read since the English language has changed substantially in the last 400 years. Likewise, since the King James Version was written, scholars have discovered numerous other manuscripts from which more accurate and current translations have been made.\nSince the late 19th century, progress made in Scripture scholarship has produced versions of the Bible that challenge the previously undisputed prominence of the King James Version. Specifically for Catholics, the King James Version follows the Protestant pattern of not including the Deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament that are recognized by Catholics: Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Sirach, Baruch, 1 & 2 Maccabees (as well as portions of the Books of Esther and Daniel). Readings from these books appear in the Catholic Lectionary at various times of the liturgical year. Likewise, these books contain references to concepts that are familiar to Catholics but rejected by Protestants such as prayer for the dead and intercessions of saints and angels. The bottom line is, it is beneficial for Catholics to use a Catholic Bible, such as the Catholic Study Bible of the New American Bible.\nBy Joe Paprocki, 7/28/2017: Why Doesn't the Catholic Church Recognize the King James Version of the Bible? | Busted Halo\n* - - - - - - - - - - - - *\nWe have to remember that the English language was used more precisely in the 1600’s when the KJV addressed the word of religion for the people. By our more relaxed English standards, the NKJV often appears to be saying something different. This gives many individuals the belief that one or the other is more accurate.\nIt should also be stated that the KJV was written entirely based upon the exclusion of the Alexandrian Manuscripts. The NKJV includes the Alexandrian Manuscripts in an effort to find more potent and direct information. Translation of the Alexandrian Manuscripts is rejected by most KJV followers.\nThe New King James Version was partially written as a new translation for the entire framework of the Bible. It was also partially written to reflect a time when translating text into personal experiences can mean different things to different people. This does not make it more liberal, it just makes it more amenable to more modern thoughts and interpretations. This is not to insinuate that the KJV is wrong.\nTo make generalizations, many of those who follow the KJV are more literal in their interpretations of text. Literal translation of the NKJV can create different meanings. Word origins and original definitions need to be considered when contemplating either version, as well as the potential for human error.\nWhen it comes to completely defining the difference between the KJV and NKJV, using linguist specialists would be applicable:\n• The KJV followers are likely to reject the NKJV.\n• The NKJV is written with word meanings that are more similar to today’s modern interpretations.\n• The NKJV includes Alexandrian texts.\n• The KJV neglected to include Alexandrian texts altogether.\n• The NKJV is written as a new translation to reflect better readability and interpretation.\n• The KJV is usually taken literally, despite the differences in language.\nDifference Between the KJV and the NKJV", 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020'}}, 'question_title': 'How accurate is the King James Bible in comparison to the Catholic Bible, and what are common, noticeable differences?', 'question_author': 'Greg Kozicki'}, 713: {'no_of_view': '1,243', 'no_of_follower': 4, 'create_time': 'Apr 12, 2020', 'topic_list': [], 'answer_count': 'error', 'respond': {}, 'question_title': 'error', 'question_author': 'Jonathan Millien'}, 714: {'no_of_view': '997', 'no_of_follower': 1, 'create_time': 'Apr 12, 2020', 'topic_list': [], 'answer_count': 2, 'respond': {0: {'view': 31, 'user_name': 'Tanvi Shetty', 'answer': 'Stay away from her ,simple !!!!

(34) Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from town to town, (35) that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zechari\'ah the son of Barachi\'ah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. (36) Truly, I say to you, all this will come upon this generation. (37) "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not! (38) Behold, your house is forsaken and desolate. (39) For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, \'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\'"\nJesus told them that Jerusalem would be surrounded by an army and accomplish God’s vengeance for Jerusalem’s rejection of the Messiah:\n[Luk 21:20-24 NLT] (20) "And when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then you will know that the time of its destruction has arrived. (21) Then those in Judea must flee to the hills. Those in Jerusalem must get out, and those out in the country should not return to the city. (22) For those will be days of God\'s vengeance, and the prophetic words of the Scriptures will be fulfilled. (23) How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days. For there will be disaster in the land and great anger against this people. (24) They will be killed by the sword or sent away as captives to all the nations of the world. And Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the period of the Gentiles comes to an end.\nThe abomination that makes [Jerusalem and the temple] desolate was the Roman army. There may be a more specific reference to Titus or the disrespectful acts of the Roman leadership toward the temple but at the end of the day the important thing to know is that Matthew 24, Luke 21 and the Revelation are all about the Roman destruction, massacre and ruination of Jerusalem and the temple and the Jewish people was the long promised judgment upon Israel for their unfaithfulness to their LORD.\nIt has nothing to do with modern times:\n[1Pe 4:17 NKJV] (17) For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?\n[1Jo 2:18 NKJV] (18) Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come, by which we know that it is the last hour.\n[Mat 3:10 NKJV] (10) "And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\n[Mat 23:36 NKJV] (36) "Assuredly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.\n[1Pe 4:7 NKJV] (7) But the end of all things is at hand; therefore be serious and watchful in your prayers.\n[Rev 22:10 NKJV] (10) And he said to me, "Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand.\nJosephus wrote of Jerusalem after the war:\n…This was the end which Jerusalem came to by the madness of those that were for innovations; a city otherwise of great magnificence, and of mighty fame among all mankind. [18]\nAnd truly, the very view itself was a melancholy thing; for those places which were adorned with trees and pleasant gardens, were now become desolate country every way, and its trees were all cut down. Nor could any foreigner that had formerly seen Judaea and the most beautiful suburbs of the city, and now saw it as a desert, but lament and mourn sadly at so great a change. For the war had laid all signs of beauty quite waste. Nor had anyone who had known the place before, had come on a sudden to it now, would he have known it again. But though he [a foreigner] were at the city itself, yet would he have inquired for it.

In some places and religions, a hat or a headscarf is still required for church. And groups like the Amish still wear the same sorts of caps they did two centuries ago.\nCovering the hair, and sometimes veiling the face, started out largely as a status thing in the Mediterranean region in ancient times. Women of higher status veiled themselves to protect themselves from the sun, from the gaze of lowly men, from evil spirits, and so on. It also signaled that her husband had enough money for lots of fine fabric and to hire or buy help to do most of the housework, since a voluminous veil or scarf would get in the way. Lower class women didn’t wear veils — they could even be punished for covering their hair.\nThe tradition stuck through the Roman era and seemed to stay with Christian women in the former empire. Married women of rank and nuns wore some kind of head covering, although for early Saxon queens in England the crown itself seems to have been enough.\nEleanor of Aquitaine made wimples, which covered the head and neck with a barbette wrapped around under the chin, fashionable in the 12th century, and in the centuries thereafter, most married women seemed to wear some sort of head covering, and often unmarried women did too. It could be a cloth coif, plain for common women, something fashionable for gentry and nobility. There was the French hood in Tudor times. Sometimes it was only a token hairband or lace/net snood, more jewellery than hair covering.\nThen came the Protestant Reformation, and women were expected to wear a very prim white linen cap that hid all the hair among the more puritan sects in the 17th century. Some even do so today.\nPlain bonnets and caps were required for honest working women through the 18th and 19th centuries, while ladies never went anywhere without a fashionable hat — which often stayed on while visiting a friend for tea. At home, they had wispy lacy things, as seen in pictures of Queen Victoria.\nAnd then, in the first half of the 20th century, respectable women wore hats for church and events and visiting. My mom had a brown satin pillbox thing with a wisp of netting, that matched her best brown dress she wore to weddings and funerals in the 1950s and early 60s, tucked away in her closet.

They think it’s the devil.”\nI don’t think that’s a fair characterisation..\nNearly all religions, with few exceptions, see some kind of mystical experience as significant. All the biggest religions, Eastern and Western, have an aspect of this: Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Daoism, Shintoism, Animism, Judaism, and so on. However, they all have limits on who should seek these kinds of experience, and when… and those rules and limits are surprisingly similar around the world. Here are some examples.\nRoman Catholic and Orthodox Christianity both include people who spend their lives trying to have a direct experience of God (although the theological details are different in each). These people mostly live as monastics, and get regular guidance from a spiritual director. They are asked to purify their conduct before getting deeply into the practices that seek divine presence or theosis. The majority who can’t commit to such a stringent life are asked just to live morally and attend services and sacraments.\nAll the Branches of Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana) have adherents who devote themselves to seeing the true nature of reality. These are mostly monastics who have a teacher. Purifying conduct is part of their practice, along with meditation seeking enlightenment. Most other followers just follow moral precepts and perform religious rituals.\nIslam includes Sufism, which seeks direct experience of Allah. The larger sect of Islam also have spiritual practices aiming for connection with Allah. Some followers devote their lives to spiritual attainment, while others are asked to just follow the conduct rules of the religion.\nHinduism includes many sects of ascetics and sannyasins who devote their lives to achieving samadhi and/or the direct experience of a deity. These people follow the advice of a guru, and prepare by purifying body and conduct. Most followers, however, simply follow devotional practices and try to live correctly.\nAnd the same pattern more or less applies to the other religions I mentioned, except that some don’t have a formal ‘ordination’ of those seeking the ultimate experience or state associated with the religion.\nThe basic pattern across them all is: those who have a special calling and no great worldly commitments may devote their life to religious attainment. Everyone else should live according to ethical rules and find time for ritual as much as they can. There is not really any East-West split in this regard.\nThere are some genuine reasons why the questioner may have formed the opinion of a difference between East and West, but they are more subtle than they seem at first.\nChristian or Islamic teachers may discourage their followers from studying things like yoga or vipassana. This may be partly through fear of ‘losing’ a follower to another religion (simply inter-religious competition), but also because there are some risks associated with meditation, and they will not be able to advise the follower about them. However, Hindu and Buddhist teachers are also aware of those risks, and will make sure a person is mentally and spiritually ready before undertaking the practices that lead to “liberation” or “divine experience”.\nSome “Western” religions don’t look like they have any goal of direct experience of the divine. For example, some Protestant Churches and some Sunni Islam. Their main teachings are about following the religious laws and sacred texts. These religions don’t have ‘monks’ or anyone who is specially devoted to attaining divine experience. Yet even these have some concept that following their religious path will bring the follower closer to the divinity (even in the current, mortal life).\nFinally, all of the monotheistic religions are unhappy about anything that looks like worshipping another God. They won’t accept practices that require the practitioner to mention Shiva or Krishna, or even the Buddha. That doesn’t mean to say they also believe that divine experiences outside of their religion are necessarily all from the devil.', 'upvote': 2, 'date': 'Apr 13, 2020'}}, 'question_title': 'Why do Eastern religions want you to have a divine experience but not Western?

This is not to say that he was greater than Jesus, nor any other prophet, in fact they both spoke the same words.\nThe problem that is found with contemporary followers of Jesus is that they do not understand his True Words, what he was really trying to say. He spoken parables. Why do you think that is? He wanted people to think. he wanted people to meditate. He wanted people to consider.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Buddha taught that each and every one of us could be part of that which the Christians call God, the same as what Jesus taught and also spoke of very basic rules about how to do so. The same as what Jesus did: be good, be kind, give to others, sacrifice yourself for others in the name of greater good.

Sacrifice yourself for others if need be, because this is the highest honored that one can give to the Universe.\nIt reminds me of a teacher in the Shambala tradition who many years ago said that within each and every person there is a spirit that embraces Basic Goodness within themselves, and it is only in times of trial and strife that this true Basic Goodness comes forward.\nThis is the highest teaching of the Buddha.

Mr. Jorge Bergoglio — whom the world calls “Pope Francis” — has reintroduced the repulsive ‘Bent Cross’ Crozier (sometimes referred to as the “Broken Cross”), after Benedict XVI had, for the most part, abandoned it. The indult blog Rorate Caeli has the story.\nThe “bent cross” ferula, or staff, which is a hideous rendition of a crucifix, shows our Lord’s legs immodestly spread apart and shows the cross bars bent, rather than straight. The following photos show that this “crucifix” is repulsive indeed, dishonors Christ, and does not inspire pious thoughts:\nThis sinister-looking cross was designed by Italian Lello Scorzelli (1921-1997) during — you guessed it — the 1960s and was introduced — you guessed it again — by “Pope” Paul VI (Giovanni Battista Montini), who used it for the first time at the closing of his modernist robber synod known as the “Second Vatican Council”, on December 8, 1965. In fact, in 1963 Paul VI had given Scorzelli a permanent job in Rome to design this and other “art” for the Vatican. Here is a picture of Paul VI with the impious cross that is sometimes mockingly referred to as the “twisted lizard”:\nThe blasphemous Scorzelli cross bears some striking resemblance to the the crucifix drawn by Belgian “artist” Albert Servaes (d. 1966) as part of his “stations of the cross”, which were condemned by the Church in 1921 under Pope Benedict XV (see here). Notice in particular the hanging head and the bent legs:\nStriking Resemblance to the Scorzelli Cross:\n“Crucifixion” by Servaes, condemned by the Holy Office in 1921\n(The full decree of the Holy Office condeming these drawings, dated March 30, 1921, can be found in the original Latin here.)\nOn September 11, 1670, under Pope Clement X, the Holy Office prohibited the making of crucifixes “in a form so coarse and artless, in an attitude so indecent, with features so distorted by grief that they provoke disgust rather than pious attention” (quoted by Jacques Maritain, Speech to Journées d’Art Religieux, Feb. 23, 1924). The reason for this prohibition has never been more obvious than now, now that the Vatican II Church has spent decades disregarding this decree and has commissioned, promoted, allowed, and tolerated the foulest modernistic displays of religious “art” around the world.\nIn addition, the indecent Scorzelli crucifix also has something in common with the heretical crucifixes of the Jansenists:\nJansenist Altar Crucifix (heretical and condemned)\nThe so-called “Jansenist Crucifix” is defined as a “crucifix in which the arms of our Lord are not extended at right angles with His sacred body, but are contractedly suspended from the cross-beam parallel with the upright portion of the cross. The symbolism of the outstretched arms is that Christ died for all men; that of the Jansenist crucifix, that Christ died only for the elect” (Frederick George Lee, A Glossary of Liturgical and Ecclesiastical Terms, s.v. “Crucifix, Jansenist” [London: Bernard Quaritch, 1877], p. 103). (This is not to be confused with the “for many” vs. “for all” issue in the Canon of the Mass – the Catechism of the Council of Trent clarifies: “…if we look to its value, we must confess that the Redeemer shed His blood for the salvation of all; but if we look to the fruit which mankind have received from it, we shall easily find that it pertains not unto all, but to many of the human race”.)\nWhen Paul VI died in 1978, his successor John Paul I retained the ferula, and John Paul II used it pehaps more frequently than anyone else. Benedict XVI used it as well, though not as often. More images can be found on Pinterest.\nTragically, the hideous Scorzelli cross is also attached to many Rosary beads among Novus Ordos, and probably even some traditional Catholics unwittingly use it, not realizing what an affront to Our Lord it is.\nIt is quite telling that out of all the beautiful and truly Catholic crucifixes and croziers the Vatican II “Popes” could use, they use the disgusting and repulsive Bent Cross, but this is no accident: It is definitely a fitting symbol for the sinister Vatican II Church, which has mocked Christ, humiliated Him, betrayed Him, has trampled Him under foot, loathes Him, teaches heresy, and presents to the world a distorted and twisted faith that is repulsive to true Catholics.\nMore Information on this:\nRorate Caeli on Francis and the Return of the Scorzelli Ferula\nWikipedia Entry “Papal Ferula”\nBlog Post with Information on Lello Scorzelli’s “Art” for the Vatican\nMore Crap “Art” by Lello Scorzelli (caution! includes nude and immodest sculptures)\nScorzelli’s Tomb Stone – with the same “Cross”\nVatican Web Site’s Explanation of the “Pastoral Staff”\nCNS Report on the Return of the Scorzelli Staff\nReality Check: The Case Against Paul VI\nPaul VI … Beatified?\nby Fr.

This temple is about one hundred kilometers from Hyderabad city and six kilometers from Jogipet mandal.\nHistory\nThe family of Ailavajjala of Bhaaradwaaja gotra was well known for several great men who were experts in the Shakta cult of worshipping Mother Goddess. In this family was born in 1917, Shree Venkataramanayya. He became a great expert in the tradition of worship of Shakti or Mother Goddess. He was a great scholar in Ayurveda, Astrology, Telugu, Sanskrit, Vyaakarana and others. He was also a poet and was an expert in Avadhaanam, a specific process of poetry requiring miraculous memory power and high and remarkable poetic skill. For a decade he traveled throughout the country from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. He spent one year in Srishailam, the abode of Lord Mallikarjuna and goddess Bhramaramba, every day bringing water in a pot from Paataalaganga- river Krishna about one thousand steps deep below- and perform Abhishekam to goddess Bhramaraamba. His lifestyle, food habits, dress and others were so simple that no one would believe that he was such a great person. He was called as Ayyagaaru by the disciples with great respect and affection.\nAyyagaaru started a group called Sri Chamundeshwari Seva Samithi Shaaktamandal in 1968. From its inception onwards a programme of worship of Sri Chamundeshwari is performed once in a month of Telugu calendar, with the name Samaavesham. In this program, the deity is worshipped in the form of a photo and a holy vessel.-Kalasham-and Shreechakram. Recitation of holy scriptures, Homam (fire sacrifice) of Saptashati, Kumaripooja and Mahapooja in the night are performed. Some celebrations were performed for three and five days and some were held at many holy places like Kashi, Rameshwaram, Kanyakumari, Badarinath Pushkarraj and others. Members of the Samithi attend all the celebrations with their own expense and render service. Five days program at Alampur-the abode of goddess Jogulaamba- with the lighting of one lakh lamps and another five days program at Feelkhana in Hyderabad for the installation of Shri Tripurasundari were held in an unparallel grand scale.\nAyyagaaru used to lay more stress on the clean and pure mind rather than traditionally prescribed practices and on the Annadanam –feeding-than the Tantric practices which are popularly followed by many stalwarts of the Shakta cult. Treating all women as the mother is the most important requirement for a Shakta devotee, in his view. He joined the goddess on Jan 31, 1988. After him, his son Shree Subrahmanya Shastry is managing efficiently the Samithi and the temple.\nWhile the monthly celebrations were going on for several years, Ayyagaru thought of establishing a temple for Sri Chamundeshwari Devi. He visited several places and selected the eastern bank of Manjeera near Chitkul village of Chilipiched Mandal in Medak district. The land was first purified by plowing and by performing sacred rites. The stone for the idol was selected from the rocks near Dharmapuri in Karimnagar district of Telangana. The idol of Sri Chamundeshwari Devi was carved by the sculptors of Tamilnadu. The nine feet high idol with eighteen arms and a flamy crown is very attractive and impressive. The idol was consecrated on Jan 2, 1983 corresponding to Ananda year Pushya month and seventh day black fortnight. Thousands of people thronged for the installation ceremony, though it was in the night.\nNormally the temple is fully constructed and then the idol is installed. But here the idol was installed initially and then the work of construction of the temple and other facilities is still going on. The pace of work of different buildings, the continuation of the arrangement of free food to the visiting devotees and the increasing number of devotees day by day are surprising. The statement of Ayyagaaru that it would become a second Varanasi is to become true very shortly, the developments show.\nOpposite the Chamundeshwari Devi, three other idols of Brahmi, Kaali and Vaishnavi are installed. Devotees get their desires fulfilled by worshipping the goddess in different ways. Taking bath overhead and directly circumambulating, without wiping the body and without changing the dress, the temple eleven to more number of times according to one’s capacity or tying a coconut in a cloth and offering it as mudupu are some methods to get the desires fulfilled.\nHOW TO REACH :\nChitkul village is located on Medak-Jogipet road near to Sangareddy city. TSRTC buses runs regularly from Medak to Jogipet.\nJogipet Bus Station is 6.8 kms, Medak bus stand is 32 kms and Sangareddy bus stand is 37.4 kms from Chitkul temple.\nAkkannapet railway station is 51 kms from Chitkul village. Lingampally Railway Station is 64 km and Secunderabad Railway Junction is 81kms. Medak railway station is being under construction and will be completed by this year.

He was a descendant of Adam’s son, Seth; and he was Noah’s grandfather. And so, he lived before the Flood.\nThe text says that Methuselah lived to be 969 years old. Some have thought that they just figured years differently back then—that, maybe, 969 years to them would be 96.9 years to us today.\nHowever, right after the Flood (Genesis 11), we have another chapter giving us the life-spans of Noah’s descendants. Their life-spans quickly descend from 602 (Shem’s age at death) to 205 (Terah’s, the father of Abraham). Later, Joseph (Abraham’s great-grandson) will die at the age of 110 (Genesis 50:26).\nSo, if Methuselah’s age was not really 969, but instead 96.9, then Joseph—after growing up in Egypt, raising a family and ruling over Egypt, died at the “ripe old age” of 11!\nClearly, 969 years of age means just that. What is evident is, world conditions before the Flood were very different from world conditions after the Flood. In fact, Genesis 1 speaks of there being a layer of water—a kind of “canopy”—over the earth; a canopy that would shield all life from much of the radiation now bombarding our atmosphere. This would explain the ability of humans—and animals—to have a much longer life span at that time. Then, during the Flood, the “floodgates of the sky were opened” (Genesis 7:11); that is, that layer of water emptied upon the earth—so, has no longer been present to shield life on earth. Result: shorter life spans. A 969-year life span falls to a 110-year life span.\nAt least, this is one thing we can say about Methuselah.', 'upvote': 1, 'date': 'Apr 13, 2020'}}, 'question_title': 'So what will you say about the guys in the Bible like Methuselah?', 'question_author': 'Onyebuchi Chukwurah'}, 819: {'no_of_view': '590', 'no_of_follower': 2, 'create_time': 'Apr 14, 2020', 'topic_list': ['Christians', 'Christianity', 'Religion'], 'answer_count': 1, 'respond': {0: {'view': 35, 'user_name': 'Brian Overland', 'answer': 'It’s actually “Fideism,” unless I have it wrong: the doctrine that faith is completely superior to any other kind of “knowledge” and that in metaphysical matters, at least, you need nothing other than Faith.\nThat does sound like the pre-supposition of a lot of Christians, doesn’t it? As well as proponents of some other faiths.\nHowever, for thousands of years, most churches and other religious institutions have tried to argue that what can be known with “the unaided reason” is consistent with what can be known by faith. And that therefore, they say, there is no conflict between Reason and Faith. This is definitely the position of the Catholic Church to this day.\nMany atheists would disagree, but that’s another matter.\nWe might say, somewhat cynically, that the rejection of Fideism is religion’s attempt to seem reasonable… especially important since the Scientific Enlightenment.\nA very good example is the work of St. Thomas Aquinas, who is very big in the Catholic Faith. He wrote a big philosophical tome called “Summa Theologica.” Aquinas tried to show all the things about God which — he argued — could be known through philosophical reasoning alone. There was only so far he could go by Reason, however, conceding that the divinity of Jesus Christ as Son of God required faith in revelation.\nThe sentiment that faith is all you need and that nothing important can be known through reason alone, is actually a minority opinion.

Just be warned, it’s R-rated in it’s original cut.\nAll this said, there is no indication in the bible that Satan would want to make such a deal. I don’t believe Satan cares about people individually at all. Instead he simply temps us to do evil and to reject God. The reason is that he hates God. So corrupting and fooling human beings into damnation is the only way Satan can hurt God. Of course by doing this, Satan is actually serving God’s purposes. Imagine a foe so powerful that no matter what you do to thwart him, you always end up as just his puppet. That’s the relationship I believe that Satan has with God. It’s not about people at all for Satan. Satan is just about trying to hurt God while all the time knowing he (Satan) is participating in his own destruction and the ultimate goal of his enemy.\nThere’s no room in this construct for humans making deals with Satan.

During the first ten years of Muhammad’s prophecy in Mecca, (circa 610-620), he ordered some of his companions to go to Axum kingdom in this territories to seek refugee from the hostile Meccans. The journey occurred first around 613-615. These refugees were well-treated by the the Negus (king) of Axum and according to popular belief, this is the reasons why Ethiopia and Eritrea were never invaded by Caliphates army following Muhammad's death, despite literally being just across the Red Sea from Arabia\nNorth Africa: North Africa at the time of Muhammad was part of Eastern Roman empire. The conquest of North Africa was part of Arab–Byzantine wars, which occurred during the period of Rashidun caliphate, the caliphate by Muhammad’s companion. Egypt was conquered early by Umar in 639. Carthage survived later until 664. Although Islam spread immediately after this conquest, many North Africans and Egyptians remains Christian or Jew. The change into predominantly Muslim region occurred over more than one millennium. There was a large pocket of Jews and Coptic Christians in the region up until 20th century, when Jews leaved due to tensions between Israel and Arab states. Culturally the population experienced a language shifts into Arabic speaking populations, however even to this day a large indigenous populations still speak native Berber languages, most notably in mountainous regions of Atlas, Jabal Nafusa, and the Siwa Oasis.\nSahel: this is the region between Sahara and the tropical Africa. Islam spread here not by conquest but by trade. Sahelians traded gold and slaves to North Africa for salt and clothes since Roman period, and once Islam spread in North Africa, the Sahelians also started to embrace Islam. Islamic empires arise among Sahelians, the largest are Mali empire (13th -15th century) and Songhai empire (15th - 16th century). Unlike North Africa, Sahel did not experience large scale language shifts to Arabic, although Arabic loanwords are present. To this day people there still used their languages. Social structure are also remained intact. In fact the Sahelian rulers used native titles, such as Mansa in Mali empire.\nEast Africa: similar with Sahel, Islam in this region spread by trade, starting circa 8th century up until Europeans conquest of the regions in 19th century. However unlike Sahel this region experienced more intensive contact with Arabia via Indian ocean trade. Therefore a new language evolved, called Swahili, with a large vocabulary from Arabic.\nMadagascar: unlike mainland Africa, this island was settled by Indonesians from Southeast Asia and have many similarity in culture among them. There is at least two different ways of Islam came to the island: one by East African trade with the Arabs and the other via Southeast Asia trade with the Malay and Javanese of modern-day Indonesia and Malaysia who converted to Islam in 15th century. However Islam today are limited to coastal north, as the interior remained animist until converted to Christianity by western missionaries and colonists.\nSouth Africa: here Islam came also from Indonesia. The Dutch who were the colonial rulers of both Java and Cape Town exiled many Javanese scholars and nobilities, most notably Shaikh Yusuf (1626–1699), who fought against the VOC to Cape Town.

There is no commitment. It’s not particularly binding. There is no personal identification at the end of the day of actually being married.\nHow many New Years resolutions do you keep? How many habits do you change each year and actually keep? I imagine most people give up before the end of January, if not by Valentines day. Those first 6 weeks are make or break.\nThose people that have institutional support, encouragement, and cheer leader—and those people taht make a real commitment to improving and turning over a new leaf—those are the people that actually create positive behavior change. Our ethical lives need that kind of renewal. They also need the renewal that comes with virtuous friendships built on kindness, care, and love rather than economic advantage or short term happiness.\nHumans are social creatures. We need other creatures living by a similar creed, principles, and values to live in a health community. We often defer to the least common denominator.\nRelativism isn’t enough to keep a civilization going. The passion for science alone can’t keep a marriage going, much less a university. You need shared culture and shared values—and a shared principle of dignity, kindness, compassion, and forgiveness.\nIn fact, the individualist self of liberalism ends up worshipping at the idols of me, myself, and I. The historical and psychological evidence on this question is crystal clear.\nScience tells us we are products of our environments. We are products of our cultures and communities. These are basic to understanding how humans operate. A person living in Wyoming lives differently in Dallas, NYC, or Zimbabwe. We are the sum of our friends and influences—we decide based on what is in our perceptual universe.\nThe more community breakdown happens—the more it's seen as “acceptable” across culture. In some sense they set a precedent or standard for good or bad. And you might be able to resist for 6 months to even 2 years, but often when goodness isn’t reciprocated, humans tend to dig in their feet and go the selfish route.\nThe hot mess that is dating on apps is a great case study in how dating and relationships used to mean something—but they are disposable items that we pick up and toss aside based on a swipe. Think about this—the community of Tinder was so toxic that Bumble was created. One of those was actually the dramatic increase in the spread of sexually transmitted disease (STDs) which should have been the canary in the coal mine that swipe-app dating and hookup culture was flawed. That signals a rather important and self-destructive cultural shift. There were enough imperfections in the swipe culture of the Bumble community that a half frozen other swipe apps were created. The problem is that swipe culture when it comes to serious relationships is a dead end. And five years that dozen will probably be a funeral pire of dating and relationship ashes.\nHumans can do nice things, but in the wild for prolonged periods of time can end up being kind of Hobbesian. A bit like the classic novel the Lord of the Flies or the dystopian science fiction classic movie Mad Max.\nIn fact, its raw human motivation and selfishness that is the reason that nations are discordant with each other, have arms races, border disputes, and war. It’s why the Prisoner’s dilemma is one of the key. It’s the reason the news is filled with the depravity and human brokenness that fills in the daily headlines.\nLove, kindness, compassion, truth, helpfulness, and forgiveness are the core glue along with patience, friendship, loyalty, empathy, and a sense of the common good that keep us together as a community. When the definition of ethical citizenship slips, the ground can fall out.\nWe can either norm these or their opposite. And by going the relativist route, you functionally give way toward indifference to one’s fellow human beings—because you dissolve the standard of excellence and humanity you expect of yourself.\nIn case you need more evidence, here is Vox:\nBut health experts increasingly view apps and sites such as Tinder, Grindr, and OkCupid as enablers of high-risk sex, helping people meet and hook up more efficiently than ever before.

Seventh day is a Holy day set apart for rest , contemplation and worship of God. It is called the Sabath day .\nWhen the Israelites occupied the land of Cannan , the land was parcelled among 12 tribes of Israel. God gave elaborate rules as to how the land was to be cultivated. One of the laws was that the land was to be given rest in the 7th year and no cultivation should be done.\nAnother condition given during the parcelling of the land was the land given to one tribe should not be sold to another tribe. This was done to prevent one particular tribe becoming too powerful at the cost of others.

There was thus a vicious circle of debt and poverty.\nTo break the vicious circle of debt and poverty, after every 49th year ie on the Fiftieth Year after seven cycles of seven (7×7) , the land was to be returned to the original owner without insisting on repayment of the loan. It was a sort of loan-waiver. Not only land, any other article or personal bondage (slaves)was to be returned.\nThis Fiftieth Year was known as the Year of Jubilee.

Later on people got divided in their beliefs and then religion was born.

Therefore, article 15 and 16 authorizses the state to make certain provisions for upliftment of backward and downtrodden sections. We can call it a system of \'affirmative action\' or \'positive discrimination\'. Article 15 & 16 allows the Indian government to set quotas to ensure any "socially and educationally backward classes of citizens" is properly represented in public life.\nWho gets the reservation and why?\nIn the indian context, our society for centuries was entrenched with caste system and systematic oppression of lower castes. For several centuries, the upper castes controlled the society in almost all the aspects, be it positions of power, education, buisness or employment. Now, post independence, India being a \'welfare state\' found it necessary to promote equality and abolish discrimination and hence introduced the policy of \'reservation\' to ensure just and proper representation in public life so that no caste/ community or group of people can claim sole authority over any sector.\nReservation is primarily given to three groups: Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes, abbreviated as SC, ST, and OBC respectively. These are groups that have faced social and economic discrimination in the past and/or the present and were severely underrepresented in public life.\nAnswer to your question\nThe central government hasn\'t granted reservation on the basis of religion in the Central educational institutions at the national level yet, although reservation has been extended to religious minorities in some states. Now, before granting reservation to a particular religion, the government will have to prove that the members of that religion faced discrimination solely because of their affiliation to that particular religion.The Government has already provided reservation to some Muslim communities under Other Backward Classes (OBC) category. Buddhists and Sikhs who belong to SC/STs get reservations. Also, government promotes the religious minorities to establish their own educational institutions. Hence, there\'s no need of granting special reservation as such moves can also encourage religious conversions for taking benifit of reservation. Even if the government comes with such a piece of legislation, it will be challenged in the supreme court as it would cross the limit set by the court. In my opinion, such reservation is completely unconstitutional as there is no reasonable classification and our constitution does not promote communal representation.\nIn the end, I would like to quote Honourable Supreme Court\'s landmark ruling\n“No provision of reservation or preference can be so vigorously pursued as to destroy the very concept of Equality”\nIndra Swhaney vs Union of India, 1992.\nThank you, Jay Hind.', 'upvote': 4, 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020'}, 1: {'view': 27, 'user_name': 'Sonanchal Time', 'answer': "India is too big to have any system based on number alone.

It isnt something that you practice once a week and other than that, you don't do anything else. I have seen many reconverts from all walks of life who find spiritual stability in Islam. I know what you hear in the media, but Islam is all about peace. A proper Muslim is someone who glorifies their Lord, is honest, helps his neighbors, donates to the poor, etc. Like I stated, it is a commitment to doing the right thing and to please God for as long as you live. When you come to Islam, you come all the way; you dedicate your heart to it. It is about resisting life's biggest deceptions (greed, sex, etc.) and only using them in necessary contexts. As I have said before, I have seen many people who have come to Islam and they have never regretted it. Our holy scripture which is the Quran is the word of God and has never been changed unlike other scriptures which have been changed in the flow of time. This is the perfected religion and it is the key to a better life. I don't know your family situation, but reconverting might not be easy.

It was not taught by Jesus or the Apostles.\nThe word “hell” is an archaic English rendering of the Hebrew word (sheol) and the Greek word (Hades) that appear in the earliest writings we have today. These words rendered into modern English would read, “the grave or under the ground” (sheol), “the place or location of the dead” (Hades). Nothing about a place of eternal punishment.\nThe word “Hell” itself was likely derived from the Latin “inferna” which is defined as: “of or relating to a nether world or place of the dead, hell”. This may have later been confused with the English “inferno” which has a very different meaning.\nJesus and the apostles had taught that death is a sleep*, to be followed by resurrection. The early church leaders – Clement, Ignatius, Hermas, Polycarp, and others who believed that death is a sleep, taught that the resurrected deliberate and unrepentant wicked are destroyed forever as if being totally consumed in a fire – their punishment was to be annihilation. These leaders did not teach of an immortal soul to be tortured by fire for eternity.\n*John 11:11-15 NIV\n11 After he had said this, he went on to tell them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up.”\n12 His disciples replied, “Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.” 13 Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.\n14 So then he told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead, 15 and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe.\nIt was Athenagorus (133 -190 AD), a professed Christian and a church leader but whose teachings, according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, were heavily influenced by Plato's philosophies, who introduced Plato's teaching of an immortal soul into Christianity. In doing so he opened the way for the adoption of Plato’s argument of eternal punishment for immortal sinful souls. This was a hundred years after the apostle's and came straight from Greek philosophy. There are no such words in the bible.\nEcclesiastes 9:5 NKJB\n5 For the living know that they will die; But the dead know nothing,\nAnd they have no more reward, For the memory of them is forgotten.\nEcclesiastes 9:10 New King James Bible\n10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going.\nJohn 5:28–29 NKJB\n8 Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice 29 and come forth--\nHell is the grave, nothing else.

It’s different from the rest of your ordinary year, it’s special. And it’s made of all these things:\nThe long late night prayers alone, contemplating things you don’t normally. The in depth personal study of the Quran through standing in prayer each night reading a different part of it is still interesting every year. What I love doing is picking a random different chapter each night depending on the way I’m feeling and seeing what little gems await inside. If you’ve ever read the Quran, you will know that chapter names are deceiving, so it’s common to end up reading really interesting tid bits of ancient stories chopped up across many different chapters.\nThe culture of the late night mosque visits. It’s like a big family gathering every night. Everyone is tired from the day but putting on their best face to make it work. Food and water is present more than ever in the mosque. Whole families present in the mosque. Laylat al-Qadr especially is like a festival, packed out wall to wall, special area arrangements, people mingling with their fellow Muslims happily like best friends, and the charity auctions, little kids walking with zakat donation boxes, etc. Late night mosque visits are also kind of hair tingling in my area since the whole street just outside the mosque is under police direction with flashing lights every night to direct the large traffic volumes mixing with outside traffic. The packed parking, parking up the street, people walking long distances to get to mosque, etc.\nThe family meals at home at sunset. Everyone is present, no doubt. Food has been cooking all day by starving people who have not tasted it. You always wonder how it will taste; and the taste always surprises you every day. There is an appetizer to break the fast and directly after the sunset prayer the full meal and most times a small desert later. A 2–3 course meal *at home.* Wow.\nThe way other Muslims treat you when you meet outside. You share in the joy of shared misery, and it’s strangely gratifying. People will talk about anything but food, though you all know what is on your minds. The subjects are usually purposefully cheerful. People also don’t want to talk too much for fear of bad breathe from fasting. You end up with really productive and interesting conversations.\nThe sleep. Napping like a baby in the middle of the day when you can, just to avoid feeling thirsty or hungry. It’s like a month of wonderful siestas.\nThe soldiering feeling that you put up with at work and school, with its resulting feeling of accomplishment. Keeping up your work production and good attitude, keeping down your temptation to lash out at people when you’re weak and hungry. It can be a full time job to itself, and at the end of the day you feel like you accomplished two jobs at once.\nThe body detox. Some people even lose weight. Practical food choices are inevitably made because of the limited eating time and shrinking stomach space available. By the end of the month, you almost don’t want to go back to eating anything anytime.\nThe increased focus. This goes along with the “soldiering feeling,” but it really has to do with making practical life choices during Ramadan to accommodate your slight weakness. It forces you to focus your energy on good things instead of useless things.\nIn general, Ramadan brings out the best in people. There’s an increased sense of community, an increased amount of prayer and reflection, a renewed determination to live your best life, and an awareness of peace that you never realized existed in your life already. All of these things make up an incredible experience each year that you would not have otherwise forced yourself into, being either too lazy or too scared to try.

Unfortunately, he is also peddling the same anti-Muslim Islamophobic arguments which he uses every time this topic comes up. These are misleading and defamatory.\nIn this post, I am going to show why. But first, let’s talk about what Islamophobia is.\nIslam is seen as a monolithic bloc, static and unresponsive to change.\nIt is seen as separate and "other". It does not have values in common with other cultures, is not affected by them and does not influence them.\nIt is seen as inferior to the West. It is seen as barbaric, irrational, primitive, and sexist.\nIt is seen as violent, aggressive, threatening, supportive of terrorism, and engaged in a clash of civilizations.\nIt is seen as a political ideology, used for political or military advantage.\nCriticisms made of "the West" by Muslims are rejected out of hand.\nHostility towards Islam is used to justify discriminatory practices towards Muslims and exclusion of Muslims from mainstream society.\nAnti-Muslim hostility is seen as natural and normal.\nI’m now going to quote his post, interrupting to comment on errors where he says something that is incorrect/flawed.\nAngus:\n“The above verse from Al Qur’an is the evidence that Islam is fixed and will never change. And therein, lies the problem!\nMy comment:\nContrary to what you consistently portray in your answers on this topic, Islam is not a single, fixed, position. It’s a vast spectrum of differing traditions, interpretations and opinions, encompassing many different schools of thought.\nFurthermore, Islamic thought, in all its varieties, has not remained static over the centuries. In fact the entire history of the faith is one of dramatically different, competing, evolving and changing views. From the Mutazila philosophers that reconciled Greek rationalism and Neo-Platonist thought with mainstream Islam, to obscure Shia sects like the Ismaili Nizari, there’s an enormous history of philosophy and theology to unpack. From al Ghazali to Ibn Rushd, from Rumi to Hafiz Shirazi, from Yunus Emre to countless others, Islam is nothing like the static, unchanging block which you try to depict.\nAngus:\nAll societies evolve. They always have. It is evident throughout the history of mankind. Whether it is technology or the ideas and moral norms that characterize our societies, everything changes.\nMy comment:\nYes, absolutely. You are correct. In fact, this observation undermines your own argument. The problem here is that you are ignorant of the changes that happened in Islamic societies. Instead of recognising that you don’t know, however, you’re simply peddling Islamophobic nonsense about how Islamic societies don’t change.\nA more sensible approach would be to go and learn about the topic, before posting. That way you would avoid irritating people like me with your uninformed opinions, which spread the same harmful and defamatory arguments that are causing Islamophobic massacres such as the one in New Zealand, as well as wars such as Iraq and Afghanistan, which were facilitated by this kind of rhetoric.\nAngus:\nMankind began with flint tools, but now we have the Hubble telescope. Along the way, the remains of failed Utopian societies litter the path of history’s relentless route-march toward the ever-receding horizon of the future.\nIn other words, Islam’s claim to have reached the pinnacle of religious and human development flies in the face of the most fundamental phenomenon that drives and shapes our lives, constant change. In that sense, Islam is another Utopian ideology — the final and perfect society — which presumes an end to human social evolution. So, evolution and change are inimical to Islam.\nMy comment:\nThis is beautifully written. In fact, aesthetically these paragraphs are so attractive that it almost seems a shame to offer criticism. Unfortunately however, they are complete nonsense. Largely for the same reasons as I’ve already stated: Islamic history is full of sweeping changes, on every level - social, cultural, economic, technological, linguistic, religious, philosophical, you name it. From the Abbasid Revolution, to the conflict between the Shia Fatimids and their overthrow by the Sunni Ayyubids, to the battle between the Asharites and the Mutazila, to the debates over secularism and the place of Islam in modern society, to pretend that Islam is fixed and unchanging, is effectively a denial of the many vastly different “Islamic” groups that have arisen and attempted to change society in one way or another, as well as the vast changes to the Muslim societies in places like Turkey, Iran and elsewhere over the past century.\nFrom Ibadis to Sunnis to Sufis to Khwarij to Alevis, Alawites, Twelvers, Ismailis, Quarmatians and countless others, there have been constant changes, conflicts, takeovers, revolutions, reforms and revivals across the Muslim world. These groups, a fraction of the true diversity, encompass a wide range of different positions and views. And that’s before we even get onto the subject of different scholars from each of these groups, which often disagree with each other on all sorts of things.\nSo no, Islam is not fixed, it never has been. And no, it is not unchanging, in fact its entire history has been one of competition and change.\nAngus:\nNot only does Islam shut out any further evolution (“This day have I perfected for you your religion,” Qur’an 5:3), it forecloses any possibility of such evolution in the future. That, in itself, is only part of a bigger problem. The bigger problem is that Islam demands that the rest of the world join its Utopian belief system. The means that the entire world would grind to a halt. Subjugating and dominating the world “until all religion is for Allah alone,” (Qur’an 2:193) is not just an idea, it involves action to force compliance by those unwilling to submit.\nMy comment:\nHere we go again. *sigh*. No. This is absolute nonsense!\nFirst of all, Islam does not force anyone to submit. Surah al Baqara 256:\n“There is no compulsion in religion.”\nThis categorically reveals that your claim is false.\nSecondly, Islam is not a Utopian belief system. It is a religion, like any other. A Utopia is a political project, which attempts to translate an ideal into a social reality. This is why Communism and Facism were attempts to create “Utopia”, whereas Christianity (and Islam) are not. A state based on Christianity (The Vatican? The Crusader States?), or a state based on Islam, would be a political project, which might be labelled a Utopia, however in that case it would still not constitute the actual religion itself.\nAngus:\nIn fact, Islam forbids change. The Arabic word, ‘bid`ah’ means ‘innovation’. The word ‘bid`ah’ in Arabic is derived from the root word ‘bada`ah’, literally meaning to create a new thing that has no precedent. However, if anything is created that might undermine Islam, or contradict what is in Al Qur’an, it is forbidden. Of course, if Islam’s claim to be ‘perfect’ is to make sense , then anything that might undermine that claim of perfection cannot be allowed.\nMy comment:\nYeah, that’s complete nonsense.\nThe Golden Age of Arabic Science saw plenty of discoveries in astronomy, medicine, engineering, physics, mathematics, philosophy, biology, chemistry, literature, art, architecture and just about every field of human endeavour.\nIn fact Islam encourages scholars to seek knowledge. There are at least 22 hadith about this, including this one:\n“He who leaves his home in order to seek knowledge, he is in god’s path until he returns to his home.” - at-Tarmidhi, Sunan; an-Nawawi, Riyad as-Salihin.\nOnce again you’re peddling Islamophobic nonsense without a shred of evidence to back it up. Also bidah does not mean what you say it means. Bidah is used in this context to refer to changes or arguments concerning religious matters which aren’t based on solid evidence. It does not, and never has done, mean that all innovation is banned. Attempting to argue otherwise is either dishonest, disingenuous, or frighteningly misinformed (the more charitable interpretation). But readers can form their own opinion.\nAngus:\nChristianity and Judaism have both experienced change - the Enlightenment and the Haskalah, respectively. These world religions have experienced huge changes. But they have evolved, so that they now mirror the societies that practise these beliefs. They have allowed their central texts to be examined in detail. There are branches of academia that have published criticisms of The Bible and The Torah. These criticisms have not ended the existence of these ideologies. They still exist today in a more acceptable form. Islam, uniquely, forbids any event like the Enlightenment.\nAnd so, the rigidity, or resistance to change which is seen as Islam’s greatest strength, is, in fact, its greatest weakness. History marches on!\nMy comment:\nYeah, no.\nHere we see Angus’s real biases coming out. Remember where I listed the features of Islamophobia, earlier? This is point 3, right here.\n“Islam is seen as inferior to the West.”\nThis is what this amounts to. Here, Angus is saying, in effect “We had the Enlightenment, neh-neh nah-nah-nah”. Like a naughty child taunting an opponent, sticking their tongue out and mocking. While ignoring the entirety of Islamic history, which Angus either doesn’t know about or doesn’t want to acknowledge, because it doesn’t fit the agenda he is trying to push.\nWhen you break it down, behind the faux-intellectual, smug, fallacious, self-satisfied, arrogant, sneering, “we are better than you” rhetoric, this is what it boils down to.\nIt really is that simple.\nPathetic.\nThanks for reading, and if you enjoyed this, please do give this post a like.

However, the Bible refers to the “wings of an eagle (USA?) being plucked off the back of a lion (England?)” with the aid of other animals which are also used to represent the UN Security Council today (i.e. a dragon for China, a bear for Russian, and a rooster for France). The description of “Bablyon” in the Revelation sounds remarkably like the USA as well, which has helped to solidify this theory. You can learn more about this by watching this video: The United Nations Security Council & Bible Prophecy (Part 1)\nThe Agreement to Rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem - The book of Daniel explains that this “agreement” between the antichrist and the Jews (whatever form that takes) will start the countdown of 7 years until the return of Christ. (See Daniel 8, 9, and 12)\nThe Abomination of Desolation - Mentioned by both Daniel and Jesus, this is expected to take place in the middle of those final 7 years, and it’s characterized by the antichrist seating himself in the Jewish temple to be worshipped as God. From this point on, the world will experience the Great Tribulation: A period of human suffering unlike anything the world has ever experienced before.\nThe Mark of the Beast - It’s not clear when this mark is implemented along the timeline of events, but the most important thing to note is that this “Mark” will be mandatory for anyone who wants to participate in the economic system (see Rev 13:16–17). All who accept this mark will enjoy a life of luxury, but then they will suffer the wrath of God at the end of the final 7 years. My friends and I made a documentary about this: The Mark of the Beast\nThe Return of Jesus and the Wrath - The rapture (i.e. Christians ascending into heaven to join Jesus in his kingdom) happens at the same time as the return of Jesus, which is at the end of the final 7 years (see Matt 24). After the rapture, God pours out his wrath on everyone else remaining on Earth, which are those who accepted the Mark of the Beast. The Tribulation should not be confused with the Wrath. The former is marked by 7 trumpets which all people (including Christians) will need to live through, and the latter is God’s “cleansing” of the Earth, for which Christians will not be present.', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 15, 2020'}, 2: {'view': 14, 'user_name': 'Curtis Scissons', 'answer': 'Israel hasn\'t been established yet.\nNot the Biblical Israel Israel prophecied in scripture.\nWhat we have now could more properly be called “Judah".\nG-d says the restored Israel will stretch “From Dan even to Be\'ersheva.”\nThat\'s not what we have right now.', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020'}}, 'question_title': 'What are the other four vital Bible prophecies in Evangelicalism, apart from the reestablishment of Israel?', 'question_author': 'Arora Yo'}, 1000: {'no_of_view': '911', 'no_of_follower': 2, 'create_time': 'Apr 15, 2020', 'topic_list': ['Religious Conversion', 'Philosophy of Religion', 'Belief and Beliefs', 'Islam', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Survey Question'], 'answer_count': 1, 'respond': {0: {'view': 36, 'user_name': 'Khairi Naser', 'answer': 'Mohammed pbuh said you are not fully a believer if you don’t love for your brother what you love for yourself.

Tithi, the lunar equivalent of the date is determined by the phase of the moon. 30 tithis make a month, and 12 months make a lunar year. Since there are 29.5 days in the period of one full moon to the next, this makes the lunar year 29.5 * 12 = 354 days long. Since the seasons repeat every 365.25, this scheme does not align with the seasons.\nA yuga is a period spanning multiple years such that the seasons and the months are aligned.\nThe earliest documented yuga is the one described by Lagadha in Vedanga Jyotisha. In this system, there are 5 years in a yuga. Using a system of adhimasa (intercalary months that are added) and kshaya tithi (intercalary days that are dropped), this system align the lunar months and the seasons.\nThen there are mentions of the 60 year yuga which aligns with the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn.\nIn the system that is currently used, the yuga is part of a grand cycle of time periods. On the endless time scale, we are supposed to be right past the middle. From this middle point, time is measured in Kalpas and Maha Yugas.1 Kalpa is 1000 Maha Yugas. Each Maha Yuga comprises 1 Krta Yuga, 1 Treta Yuga, 1 Dwapara Yuga and 1 Kali Yuga in the ratio of 4:3:2:1 (in terms of duration). A Kali yuga is 432000 years long. Therefore the Maha Yuga is ten times that at 4320000 years.\nThis system is documented in the astronomical treatise, Surya Siddhanta. That treatise specifies the number of revolutions of each planetary object in units of number of revolutions in a Maha Yuga. Instead of saying that the sidereal period of moon is 27.32 days, the Indian system would say there are 1603000080 days in a Maha Yuga and that there are 57753336 revolutions of the moon in the same period.

He concluded that life is short and we want to make use of every minute of it.\nI explained to him that he married up to 4 ladies, and that is not a reason not follow Islam because as he said life is short, temporary and full of problems like aging and sickness and death, and all will move to another world which will be permanent, and more sensible if one is accepted to attain the good house (the heaven).\nIt will not only to stop at that but there will be another house, which is the hell for the refusals of Islam, an atonement, inferno and a permanent punishment for this group.\nIn general, Islam is justifiable because it is a continuation of the previous religions, like the Judaic and the Christianity, and the Quran is the replacement of Torah and the Gospel - known as the old and new testament.\nThe reason for the updating and the replacement was that something happened to those scripts that affected the purity of the holy books and while the Quran script is pure and original from God Almighty to update of what was missed or wronged in those two old holy books.\nFinally, Islam doesn’t differentiate the messengers and prophets of God and regards them all as one category but being all teaches of God who were living in different eras and were all servants of God and were conveying His mission in different nations and eras.\nThe main points of the Quran for Christians to know is to teach them that Jesus was human and was born without father, and God created him in this way like God created Adam and Eve without parents, and that Jesus was a prophet of God and His messenger like Moses, David, Muhammad, PBUH; and nothing else teaching further that there is no son of god or no father and son, etc.\nMoreover, the Quran teaches the Jews that Jesus was a honorable prophet of God and Mary was an excellent lady chosen to be a mother of a great personality as above because the Jews plotted against him to hang but was not successful to do so and God saved him by lifting him up in the high heavens, another was killed in the pole who was a replacement and a traitor who wanted to sell Jesus.\nThus the Quran contains the main points of the previous scripts in original plus new rules and regulations of the present situation of the world and its future.

He was one of the jinn; he disobeyed the command of his Lord” (Quran, Surah Al-Kahf: 50).\n….And they prostrated except Iblis (Satan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allah)” (Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah: 34).\n“And verily, the curse shall be upon you (Satan) till the Day of Recompense (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)” (Quran, Surah Surah al-Hijr: 34 – 35).\nWhile do nothing is always an option, but based on the above if you disobey Allah, you become one of the Shaytaan.\nSo essentially, in the above context, if you disagree with Allah, you disagree with the following verse of the Quran:\nDid I not ordain for you, O Children of Adam, that you should not worship Shaitan (Satan). Verily, he is a sworn enemy to you. (Quran, Surah Al-Yasin: 60)\nNow worshipping Satan means worshipping your whims. So here is the thing:\nWithin Islam, obligatory duties take precedence as they establish the Muslim’s identity and foundation of belief. When Satan’s efforts to influence the staunch believer hit a dead end, he attempts to make the ‘recommended’ lawful deeds appear more inviting than ‘obligatory’ duties thus pulling the believers away from the obligatory duties of Islam. For example, helping and supporting parents and family members is more important than helping friends.\nNow look at this verse from the Quran:\nFrom the evil of the retreating whisperer Who whispers [waswas] into the breasts of mankind (Quran, Surah An-Nas: 4–5)\nSo, without your knowledge its Satan, who is creating this waswas (insinuating whispers from the Shaitan) in your chest, what he is saying is:\nDon’t obey Allah, if you wish don’t obey me as well, but follow your whims and eventually become one of him.\nWhat Satan is trying to do is, he is trying to extinguish the flame of Emaan (belief) in your heart (Qulub) by his evil whispers in your chest (Sudoor) thus deviating you from the truth.\nBut Allah further commands in the Quran:\n“Certainly, you (Satan) shall have no authority over My worshippers, except those who follow you of the Ghawun (and those who go astray, criminals, and other evil-doers)” (Quran, Surah Al-Hijr: 42).\nSo you are only safe till the time you have the flame of Emaan in your heart.\nNow coming to the second part:\nThe decision of whether you are going to Jannah or Jahannum is decided by Allah on the Day of Resurrection, maybe your one deed may have enough weightage to let you enter the Jannah. However in this context:\nOn the day of resurrection as per Quran, Satan shall say:\nAnd the Satan will say, after the judgment had been issued, "God has promised you the truthful promise, and I promised you, but I broke my promise. I had no power over you; I simply invited you, and you accepted my invitation. Therefore, do not blame me, and blame only yourselves. My complaining cannot help you, nor can your complaining help me. I have disbelieved in your idolizing me. The transgressors have incurred a painful retribution." (Quran, Surah Al-Ibrahim: 42)\nAnd Allah will say:\nShall We then treat the People of Faith like the People of Sin?

This is not meant to downplay the conflicts that do occur but to contextualize them historically. These two faiths share more in common than many might initially think. With the rise of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia around the world, it is important to understand what these two faiths have in common.\nThe Qur’ān refers to Jews and Christians as people of the bookأهل الكتاب.This means that they have a special place and treatment because of their similar beliefs with Muslims. Many might be surprised to know that Islam allows Muslim men to marry Jewish or Christian women. Further, Islam allows Muslims to eat meat that was properly slaughtered by a Jew or Christian. The two faiths are not as radically different than some might expect. The purpose of this article is to dispel the myth that Islam and Judaism are completely at odds by highlighting some of the similarities between the two religious traditions.\nThey worship the same God\nIslam and Judaism are resolutely monotheistic faiths. Allah is the Arabic name for God. The Arabic name Allah has linguistic connotations that are not shared with the English term God. For instance, the word Allah cannot be made plural like the word God. Nevertheless, Allah is the same Creator, Sustainer, and Provider that Jews and Christians worship.\nJesus\nBecause these two faiths are strictly monotheistic in nature, they both do not consider Jesus to be divine. They both consider it blasphemous to attribute a literal son to God. The idea that God has a son is inconsistent with the uncompromising monotheistic message found both in the Qur’ān and Torah. However, unlike Jews, Muslims believe that Jesus is a great Prophet of God who delivered the message of Oneness to the Children of Israel and that his mother Mary was the greatest of all women.\nProphets\nMuslims and Jews share beliefs in certain Prophets. They both believe that God sent Prophets to mankind to deliver the message of monotheism. Jews believe that Moses is the greatest of all Prophets who was sent to mankind. Muslims also believe in Moses, who is, in fact, the Prophet most mentioned in the Qur’ān. Muslims and Jews also believe in Abraham, Noah, David, Solomon, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. Because Muslims believe in all Prophets and Messengers, they also believe in the scripture they delivered. Therefore, Muslims believe that Moses was given a book called the Torah. However, they believe this book was not preserved in its original form. For Muslims the Prophet Muhammad, God’s final Messenger to mankind who delivered the final book, the Qur’ān.\nJerusalemبيت المقدس\nHistorically, many of these Prophets resided in the city of Jerusalem. Both Islam and Judaism consider Jerusalem to be a holy city. Prophet Solomon established the first Temple in Jerusalem which made it the religious centre for Judaism. Jerusalem is Islam’s third-holiest city after Mecca and Medina. Prophet Muhammad was taken on a miraculous journey from Mecca to Jerusalem and then ascended to the heavens.\nCircumcision\nIslamic law and Jewish law share many things in common. In the Bible, Abraham was commanded to undergo circumcision. This practice has been established among Abraham’s children. The Torah instructs that newborns be circumcised on the eighth day after birth. The command for circumcision is not in the Qur’ān, but the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him required it for his male followers.\nDietary Restrictions\nJews only eat kosher and Muslims only eat halal. There are many similarities between kosher and halal, and in some cases, kosher is considered halal for Muslims. Some kinds of foods, such as pork, are prohibited in both Islam and Judaism. Other kinds of foods must be prepared in a certain way for them to be permissible for consumption. The animal must be slaughtered properly, mentioning the name of God, and for Jews, the person must be Jewish. However, Muslims are allowed to consume an animal if it is slaughtered by a Muslim, Jew, or Christian.\nFemale Head Covering\nBoth religions encourage modesty and require that women cover their hair. This is not meant to detract from women’s beauty, but to channel it to her marriage where it truly belongs. Many married Jewish women wear a scarf to cover their hair. Islam instructs that women wear a headscarf (hijab) after puberty. Along with the head covering, both religions encourage women to dress modestly. This includes wearing long and loose-fitting clothing. Although they both cover in very similar ways after 9/11 Muslim women have been targeted for their hijabs more than women of other faiths.', 'upvote': 1, 'date': 'Apr 12, 2020'}}, 'question_title': 'How similar is Judaism to Islam?', 'question_author': 'Eishita Lal'}, 1149: {'no_of_view': '478', 'no_of_follower': 0, 'create_time': 'Apr 12, 2020', 'topic_list': [], 'answer_count': 3, 'respond': {0: {'view': 13, 'user_name': 'Nisar Ahmed', 'answer': 'First of all.

A lengthy oblong religious edifice, rectangular in shape with an apse at one end. This name was originally given to certain ancient churches in Rome, the Holy Land, and elsewhere that were converted from pagan edifices to Christian use. The width of a basilica building is never greater than one half of its length. It is divided by rows of columns into a central nave and a surrounding aisle, or ambulatory. The upper part of the nave is lighted by clerestory windows overlooking the roof over the aisles. Similar lower windows light the aisle sections. The later is placed within or before the apse arching from the nave and opening into the transept , or cross hall.\nAt the main entrance to the basilica is the narthex, beyond which the early neophytes were not admitted. St. John Lateran, the Mother Church, is the archbasilica of the West, the Pope; St. Peter’s for the patriarch of Constantinople; St. Paul’s Outside the Walls for the patriarch of Alexandria; St. Mary Major for the patriarch of Antioch; St. Lawrence Outside the Walls, for the patriarch of Jerusalem. Each of these major basilicas has an altar exclusively for the Pope’s use, and by others with only his permission. Adjoining their basilicas were the former residences of the various patriarchs when they were in Rome.\nSt. Francis of Assisi’s church is also a major basilica with a papal altar and a throne. Eleven churches in Rome and many others throughout the world have been designated by the Pope as minor basilicas, e.g., at Loreto and Padua in Italy, Lourdes in France, Lough Derg in Ireland. The clergy who serve in them enjoy a title of honor that gives them certain ceremonial rites.\nfrom A Catholic Dictionary, edited by Donald Attwater, Second edition, revised 1957\nCathedral, Cathedral Church. The church of a diocese in which the bishop has his permanent episcopal throne or cathedra: usually and properly the cathedral is found in the town from which the diocese takes its name and wherein the bishop lives. A cathedral is not of necessity a large church, and there are sometimes larger and more beautiful parish churches in the same tow, the cathedral being venerable for its old foundation and historical associations; but it must be consecrated, and the date of its consecration and the feast of its titular are observed liturgically throughout the diocese. The cathedral is served by the chapter of canons whose duty it is to perform the liturgy therein daily; in the U.S.A. and elsewhere there are no canons, and in those Irish dioceses that have them they are not resident; in Great Britain, too, the canons are otherwise employed, but at Westminister Cathedral the whole liturgy is celebrated daily by a special college of chaplains. The cathedral is the mother church of the whole diocese, and its clergy have precedence, but in Great Britain the significance of the cathedral is somewhat obscured from the people, through the religious life of the diocese not centering round it so much as it does elsewhere. Architecturally the outstanding Catholic cathedrals in Great Britain are Westminister and Oban (Argyli).\nfrom A Catholic Dictionary, edited by Donald Attwater, Second edition, revised 1957\nChapel (late Latin, cappella, a little cloak [from the sanctuary in which was enshrined the cloak of St. Martin of Tours]).\ni.

Remember 200 years ago phones weren’t even invented and yet we have iPhones these days.\nThe idea that you can blame a particular incident on the Puritans and tie it to a group today is a dubious one, which is “guilt by association” itself a logical fallacy.\nNot to mention, materialists don’t look well on witches either. The root cause of this goes far beyond the decisions based on the principles of Jesus Christ. There is certainly a case that a truly Christian approach to this issue would have yielded different results.\nThe real root of the matter:\nWere there alternative selfish and/or emotional causes to the actions?\nWhat would Jesus have done? What is the truly Christian answer in such a situation?\nWithout answering both those questions you are missing the boat entirely.\nPaying attention to the right questions—not necessarily all questions is what matters. These questions get at the heart of the matter.\nInitially, the model of Acts 8:9 and Acts 19:19 isn’t one of administering the death penalty. This is the best New Testament model we have for handling issues like this. Additionally:\nAnother reason the Salem witch trials were unbiblical is the manner in which they were carried out. The historical accounts of the trials make it pretty clear that most of the accused were really the victims of mass hysteria, petty jealousy, or gossip. Little evidence was produced to verify the charges leveled, and that which was produced was hearsay or circumstantial. In most cases it was one person’s word against another, and once the charge was made, the victim’s word was rejected. Those responsible for the trials were in most cases probably guiltier of sin than those who were accused. Lies, gossip, and slander were the rule of the day, and God was certainly not honored in anything that was done there. First Corinthians 13:4–7 stands as an indictment on those who carried out the Salem witch trials, showing that they did not have the love of God within them.\nSo sin is at the root of the question. And the answer would have been on both sides to be more Christ-like, not less. More lover, kindness, empathy, truth, and forgiveness. Not less.\nThe questions contained in the trial certainly arise in different froms in history. The issue of security, law, and order and the abuse of those terms in utilitarian terms are a question which is best answered not by relativism or nihilism, but the principles and values of Jesus. The Nietzschian or Hobbesian answer to these questions would have resulted in even worse injustices, so it actually puts the agnostic or atheist in problem moral quandry.\nNot to mention, you can’t necessarily even put all Puritans in the same boat, due to diversity of belief: Different Types of American and English Puritans\nBut to answer the original question, Presbyterians, but the 200+ years of evolution between when they occurred and 2020 America.\nSecond, you have to take into account how many Presbyterians there have been in history. Millions and millions and the Salem Witch Trials only happened once and in one particular time period.\nUltimately, the questions that CS Lewis raised against atheism in his time as an atheist, and then as a Christian around the lack of a solid root and foundation (ontological and otherwise) for objective ethics is highly, highly problematic. Lewis details these in the first couple pages of Mere Christianity, if you are interested.\nSource: Were the Salem Witch Trials biblical?', 'upvote': 0, 'date': 'Apr 13, 2020'}}, 'question_title': 'What modern day religion is closest to Puritanism?', 'question_author': 'Noah Szwagulak'}, 1189: {'no_of_view': '657', 'no_of_follower': 1, 'create_time': 'Apr 15, 2020', 'topic_list': ['Quran Verse', 'Quran and Sunnah', 'Quranic Studies', 'Prophets and Prophetesses', 'Muhammad (Islamic prophet)', 'The Quran', 'Muslims', 'Earth (planet)', 'Islam', 'Religion'], 'answer_count': 3, 'respond': {0: {'view': 46, 'user_name': 'Frank Rudolph', 'answer': 'He was possibly asking Mr. PBUH a question.\nThe correct answer would have been: “no” - It is not reported whether (and which) answer Mr. PBUH gave.\n“We” is Allah, God and himself: Allah - in that aspect - is like Donald Dump: Always speaking about himself in plural to make him sound more important!', 'upvote': 2, 'date': 'Apr 15, 2020'}, 1: {'view': 10, 'user_name': 'AbdulKarim Kawsara', 'answer': '“Majestic Plural” is the concept you need to research.\nRoyal we - Wikipedia\nDespite a plural being used, it does not denote multiple entities.

And he spoke to the brahmin: “What might have been the topic of conversation, brahmin, among the king’s courtiers when they sat together today in the royal palace?”\n“The topic of conversation was this, Master Gotama: ’Formerly there were fewer monks, but there were more who displayed miracles of supernormal power transcending the human level. But now there are more monks, but fewer who display miracles of supernormal power transcending the human level.’ This was the topic of conversation.”\n“There are three kinds of miracles, brahmin. What three? The miracle of supernormal power, the miracle of thought-reading, and the miracle of instruction.\n“What now is the miracle of supernormal power? There is one who enjoys the various kinds of supernormal power: having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as if through space; he dives in and out of the earth as if it were water; he walks on water without sinking as if it were earth; while seated cross-legged he travels through the sky like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the sun and the moon, so powerful and mighty; he exercises mastery with his body even as far as the Brahma-world. This, brahmin, is called the miracle of psychic power.\n“What now is the miracle of thought-reading? There is one who, by means of a sign, declares: ’Thus is your mind, such and such is your mind, thus is your thought.’ And however many such declarations he makes, they are exactly so and not otherwise.\n“Another does not make his declarations by means of a sign, but after hearing voices of humans, of spirits or devas … or by hearing the sound of a person’s thought-vibrations … or by mentally penetrating the direction of his mental dispositions when he is in a thought-free state of meditation. And however many such declarations he makes, they are exactly so and not otherwise. This is called the miracle of thought-reading.\n“And what, brahmin, is the miracle of instruction? There is one who instructs thus: ’You should think in this way and should not think in that way! You should attend to this and not to that! You should give up this and should dwell in the attainment of that!’ This is called the miracle of instruction.\n“These, O brahmin, are the three kinds of miracles. Of these three miracles, which appeals to you as the most excellent and sublime?”\n“As to the miracles of supernormal power and thought-reading, Master Gotama, only one who performs them will experience their outcome; they belong only to one who performs them. These two miracles, Master Gotama, appear to me as having the nature of a conjurer’s trick. But as to the miracle of instruction-this, Master Gotama, appeals to me as the most excellent and sublime among these three.\nFrom Anguttara Nikaya 3:60, Do Monks Benefit Others?\n-\n"Venerable Sir, I have heard this: \'The recluse Gotama claims to be omniscient and all seeing, to have complete knowledge and vision thus: "Whether I am walking or standing or sleeping or awake, knowledge and vision are continuously and uninterruptedly present to me."\'\n"Vaccha, those who say thus do not say what has been said by me but misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to fact."\n"Vaccha, if you answer thus: \'The recluse Gotama has the threefold true knowledge,\' you will be saying what has been said by me and will not misrepresent me with what is contrary to fact.

The Muslim Army conquered and completely defeated the Persian empire in about 30 years but when it reached Afghanistan this is what happened:\nThe first attempt ended in failure and defeat for the Muslim Army.\nThe second attempt was a military victory and Kabul was taken.\nFinally, It took more than 100 years after conquering the Afghans for them to finally accept Islam as their religion. Please see this link for details: https://defence.pk/pdf/threads/islamic-conquest-of-afghanistan.321838\nIt is usual for the subdued inhabitants of any country to naturally start embracing the culture/religion of the victorious and occupying force. One example is the colonization of Africa where Africans basically abandoned their own culture and embraced European mode of dress, laws, foreign religions, moral standards etc. Also, Japan largely embraced western culture after their defeat in World War 2. Some remnants of their culture still remain but the basic foundations are no longer there e.g. believing in the divine nature of the Emperor. Islam initially spread this way as well. However, no people gave the Muslim armies a bigger challenge in terms of gaining military victory and embracing Islam than the Afghans.\nNow. let us look at the present day situation, Afghans are by their very nature rigid in their beliefs. In addition, western forces are trying to introduce democracy and western systems of governments such as the separation of church (in this case mosque) and state which is probably considered sacrilegious by most Afghans.\nThink about it, it took more than a century for a military conquest and another century for cultural/religious conversion. According to me, this is the last time the Afghans were truly defeated. The Soviets may have occupied Afghanistan militarily or via proxies but they never won the war which would mean convincing (not forcing) a majority of the enemy that the invader’s beliefs and customs are superior to their own. It takes patience, and a lot of it. See the photo below of Afghan women during the Soviet occupation:\nIt is claimed President Trump was shown the above photo by his generals as proof that Western culture existed in Afghanistan and could exist once again so that he could change his decision and not withdraw US forces from Afghanistan. See this article: The Mini-Skirt Deception: How McMaster Got His Afghan 'Surge' - Antiwar.com Original\nHowever, this photo is misleading. The photo is of upper class women, probably daughters of the elite who were cooperating with the Soviet occupation forces. Most Afghan women at that time probably looked like this:\nThis means the Pashtuns, since the Muslim conquest mentioned above, have stuck rigidly to those beliefs. This is why Islamist governments have a much easier time governing the country because:\nThey are not foreigners nor locals seen as collaborating with foreign forces in the occupation of the country.\nThey apply laws which are in line with the people’s culture.\nThis is not to say that the US cannot win in Afghanistan. The US can win militarily e.g., by using nukes but they would probably have to kill a lot of people, maybe even everyone.\nThe USA may also win culturally i.e., exporting democracy, feminism, etc., but in my opinion, they would have to commit to stay in Afghanistan for more than a century considering that parts of the country are still under the control of the Taliban which means no Western cultural influence in those areas. However, this would mean a lot more troops, continuing to fight an expensive war and continuing to deal with insurgency and resistance in various forms.\nAn alternative would be to leave the country to be governed in a fashion similar to Pakistan. A democracy, sort of, but with heavy religious influence i.e. Islamic laws in the constitution.\nHistory is very important.
