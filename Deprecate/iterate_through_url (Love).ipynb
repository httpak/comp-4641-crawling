You know that I couldn’t be any less qualified to answer this question, but I’ll try my best.\\nLust is selfish, if you really think about it. When you lust after someone, you're more focused on your desires and what you want. You couldn't care less about them, but you crave the feeling of excitement that comes with possibly catching them. Your heart skips a beat when you hear a song on the radio that reminds you of them. You are always on edge, for fear of scaring them away if they see who you truly are.\\nLove is selfless. When you love someone, you go out of your way to make things easier for them. You offer them the last piece of bacon even though you really want it. You don't leave your socks on the floor because you know it irritates them. You sit through their rants about WWII even though it bores you to death. Most of all, you're comfortable and content with them.\\nI would imagine that the same goes for intimacy of any form.\", 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020', 'user_name': 'Maisie Rowley', 'view': 17, 'upvote': 2}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

There's no why to it, no grand design, just the worst possible engineer and a bunch of meat.\\nNow, how - that's going to get you a lot further.\\nI'm not exactly aromantic per se - but close enough to make little difference. For me it's more like my romance scale is on a completely different axis from other people's, enough that it's extremely rare for someone to hit on it. Nonetheless, I love so many people, and I'm surrounded by love in turn. How can that be?\\nWell, I've always been a little confused about how people talk about “love” like it's a bunch of different unrelated things. I've never seen this clear shining division between “friend” and “loved one” and - if we're compatible - “lover.” They're different facets, different expressions of the same feeling, and they blur and flow into each other at the edges. I've got partners where we're both genuinely unsure of when the relationship really started.\\nBut when people talk about The One and how the rest of the world falls away, how their friends disappear when they have a new partner, the chivalry and “sweep her off her feet” stuff? Does nothing for me. Bit of a turn-off, actually. That's just… not how it works, for me.

I am not an expert but in my experience they do this to shift the power to themselves.

They love to just “disappear” without warning and make you wonder “did i say something wrong? what did i do wrong to make them leave suddenly? it must have been something really bad!” Then you will chase them and try to apologize… even though you know of nothing you did wrong. When they proclaim their “love”, they are lying! I found this out the hard way. I refused to believe it, but now I know it is the truth.

Physical looks are nothing when compared to the character. Character lasts life long not looks. So choose wisely, someone whose character is attractive.\\nRespect should be the first quality for a desirable partner. Without respect there is no value. Without value there is no gratitude for what you have.

They hint at this in the beginning when Shadow Weaver establishes that she believes Catra's only merit was Adora. When Adora left, Catra took it personally. She faced inner turmoil, struggling with loneliness, betrayal, jealousy, and the blunt fact that Adora was her strength and her protector.\\nThis theme continues throughout the show and reveals itself time and time again. Catra is trying to be the strongest one without Adora, and some part of her must still be in love with Adora for her to be able to throw everything away to capture her.

That’s not to say it’s uncommon - it is not uncommon, but should not be thought of as “normal”. This sounds like a pretty sick relationship and why someone would stay in it is beyond me, EXCEPT for the reason that‘s most often given - “….but, I LOVE him/her!” Whatever you;re feeling it could only be called “love” by a stretch. Real love doesn’t hurt, no matter what the song says. If living with her has become a “nightmare”, then you must contend with the idea that leaving her should be healthier than staying currently is. You may WANT her, you may have become habituated to her (and all the pain), you may have committed to staying with her “no-matter-what”. Now you know what “no matter what” really means. “Love” is NOT enough to keep a relationship going in a healthy direction - it also requires respect, honesty, compassion, empathy, understanding, communication (constantly).

All positive attributes (nothing negative or “conditional”)\\nDescribe her attributes that you deem important. Her loving smile. Her eyes that glisten and radiate love.

Perhaps you just want to hold her tight and never let go. Or, you just want to protect her from the hardships of life. Assess your own feelings and express them.\\nHowever, do not mention anything of a personal sexual nature. Such as exploring her body or seeing her naked. At this stage of the relationship such frank feelings would be a turn-off to her and maybe a deal-breaker. OK to tell her how you feel when kissing. But no further with a sexual theme. (Assuming your feelings would be OK if your Mother is reading the letter.)\\nTell her how you would like the relationship to continue and grow. Perhaps you are looking into the future with her at your side and supporting each other in all matters of hardships. And your love for each other will see both of you through hard-times and make the “good times” even more enjoyable.\\nGood advice here: Do not put anything in the letter that would not be approved of by your Mother.

(I consider marriage and cohabitation as the same… am excluding the legal part of it.)\\nI am 47, I like the way women think, am attracted to a range of women, am healthy, good looking enough, work hard, and have no major social dysfunctions, fetishes, or unfair expectations in a partner that I knew of. I have never married (did believe in it), no children (not a decision not to have them), and was actively looking for love/ dating for many years before ending the search.\\nBefore figuring out the answer to this very question I had figured it was me attracting emotionally unhealthy women; I just needed to keep looking for the right type of woman. I changed focus to what I really wanted in a healthy relationship, but it didn’t seem to exist in women; I stopped actively looking about 2 years before the answer came with a discussion on InCels and the emotional equivalent in true forced loneliness (TFL).\\nWhen I gave up actively dating, I found myself habitually chasing the emotional rewards of self-sacrifice with women I like, who have no romantic interest in me, as a way of staying emotionally active in the romantic sense and to get some of my needs met. I was working through that, almost stopping the worst habits, when I learnt of TFL, but it wasn’t quite me so I looked for the answer and finally found the answer for me in the red pill philosophy.\\nAll romantic interest in women ended almost instantly when I figured out that what I was chasing wasn’t possible and that what I was chasing was normal and healthy. I tried celibacy, found out that I liked the state; my sexuality crashed for a few months, when it returned it had changed to boring. With the romantic stress gone and better health in every area of life I knew that going my own way was the best choice for me; am now committed to my freedom from the romance.\\nOne thing I discovered about myself that I never knew is that I have a very low MachIV, I suspect this was a major contributor to not marrying in my case. The other contributor was my experience around abusive men/ women, narcissists and users when I was younger, the INFJ instinct was pretty finely honed over the years. Lastly my personality and communication styles are quite unusual and flexible, as an example my DISC/ DISA profile is about evenly D (Dominant) and S (Stable). Add all of this up and it is a recipe for a happy single life.\\nThe answer I found in the red pill philosophy and the healthy emotional trait in women I was chasing but couldn’t find was in the differences in how men and women love and what they chase in romantic partnerships. For me what was on offer had minimal value, I was asking something of women they had no interest in offering. I still want it deep down but don’t even fantasise about getting it anymore.\\nThis need I will have to live with outside of the romantic relationship just as every other man does; whether he knows he has the need or not. This is the answer to your question, for some men the need for a particular type of love from women is exposed, even as just an instinct; most men only see the veil lifted after committing, causing the so called midlife crisis (it really is just awareness).', 'date': 'Apr 11, 2020', 'user_name': 'Censored Mgtow', 'view': 55, 'upvote': 1}, 1: {'answer': 'Same reason woman do.

The beauty of one-sided love is that one of you are always sure that you don't want it.

It means that I stand here before you in love who I am, knowing where I’m from and knowing that wherever I go I want you, the love of my life to be apart of it every step of the way.\\nIt becomes complicated when I don’t know the answer to the following statements I mentioned also above;\\nLove of Self. Knowing exactly who you are and what you believe and not falling victim to doubt and low self esteem.\\nOwn where you have come from, acknowledge and give thanks to the ups and downs for they have made you into the person you are today.\\nSpring clean. Get rid of all toxic energies, face the baggage you’ve been carrying around. Lighten the load for more opportunities of love and light in your life. Apart of moving on is letting go.\\nIt can be confronting finding out you actually don’t have your life together. Even more so when you find someone a friend or lover, someone you have fallen in love with. In my personal experience we grew way too co-dependent on one another. I looked at him for stability and escape. He looked at me for assurance and validation. We took comfort in one another and formed the most beautiful bond. It took the fear of losing him forever to convince me that I had to look at the skeletons in my closet first, before I lose myself in the process.\\nLove of self was the first step. I care for my well-being and need to take time to worry about me for awhile. He did too. We each needed to climb down from our cloud of bliss and figure out who we were and what we wanted. We would not survive if we grew to argue and resent each other, something had to change.\\nThe second step was actually owning it. In these uncertain times of isolation and the pandemic at large, I was forced to think about myself. I had to look in the mirror at all my mistakes and negative thoughts and just own it. Let go of judgement and how uncomfortable it might make people feel. I had a lot of unresolved issues with my mum and family that I had hid for so long. I was unravelling, there were tears, laughs and a lot of pain. I was unravelling, but I was feeling the best I’d ever felt in a long time.\\nIt was time to spring clean. Get rid of social media that was damaging my current mental health. Of course I couldn’t get rid of it so decided to change the vibe. Post more positive quotes and ideas. Talk to old friends, lessen time I spent talking to friends who were negative. I literally spring cleaned my room, got rid of clutter and rubbish. I let go of items that had no purpose in my life anymore.\\nWe accept the love we think we deserve. I deserve the best and he deserves the best, but the best of each other. If we don’t love who we are how are we supposed to love someone else.\\nEvery day that we were not talking, every day that we spent not seeing each other. I spent it thinking of him. Love is not easy and it isn’t a one size fits all either, but it is patient and kind, it is not jealous or greedy. I believe love is the union of two complete souls.

Ramayan and Mahabharat have a differnet genre. Lets not compare Shaktiman and Ramayan and Mahabharat.\\n1990’s was a different era. Indians in general did not knew much about Superman other than his flying powers. Most of us did not knew then that Superman was a generalist and so was his love interest. Also Jackal was similarly inspired from Lex Luthor. Shaktiman similarly loses his power in front of Pap Mani as superman loses by Kryptonite. Many villains like electraman, toyman etc were heavily inspired from Marvel and DC comics. MCU and DCEU and social media etc have made American comic characters favourite in India and so a copy would not be that successful.\\nI was a huge fan of Shaktiman then, but now whenever Shaktiman video appears randomly in my facebook feed, I find those graphics and story so funny. Kids today, see MCU and DCEU and even they won’t accept Shaktiman with those special effects.\\nAlso, Ramayan had somewhat 70–80 episode and Mahabharat had 94 episodes. Their stories have an end. Shaktiman’ s biggest drawback is its story never completed. 520 episodes and 8 years of run time and its end was never on the horizon.\\nSo no, Kids and even vella people who loved it back then would not give it such a response as Ramayan and Mahabharat received.', 'date': 'Apr 12, 2020', 'user_name': 'Ashwini Bhardwaj', 'view': 39, 'upvote': 1}}, 'topic_list': ['Shaktimaan (TV series)', 'Doordarshan National (DD1)', 'Doordarshan News (DD News, Indian TV news channel)', 'Doordarshan Network', 'Television Series in India', 'Television in India', 'Children', 'Television Series', 'Love', 'India']}\n",

The main question to be asked here is if there was love then why break up? In a break up the relationship ends but not the feelings and we generally tend to read in between the lines. If you have broken up it is the best thing to move on and not think about it absolutely. Attachments are not easy to get over with but then thinking whether love still exists between you two would be an unnecessary torture. Whatever happened between you two after the break up think of it as a moment where just the attachment surfaced but not the love. Just let it go. It is better this way.

If not, I’d like you to rethink why you think he is one. If your boundaries were being stepped on, and you weren’t getting any respect- which is why you think of him as a sociopath, ask yourself why you’d still like to be with him. What’s your motivation? many times in toxic relationships, there is an idea that “I can save/change/rescue him with the power of true love”. This idea is utter bullshit. If he is a sociopath, or even a garden variety narcissist, changing him is above your pay grade. Even world famous psychologists cannot change them completely even when the patient wants the change.\\nSecondly, love doesn’t always mean happily ever after. Sometimes, love means letting go of someone so that they have the time and space to heal. If you stay in a toxic relationship, the toxic person gets the idea that it is okay to be toxic, and doesn’t really have the motivation to question themselves or change their life. The drama of a toxic relationship feeds their sickness and they get worse, not better.\\nSo, if you truly love him, ask yourself this: Do you want him to be sicker because of you?', 'date': 'Apr 12, 2020', 'user_name': 'Shivani Roy', 'view': 36, 'upvote': 2}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

You have had a bad break up recently and are really heartbroken. While you loved the sensation of being loved and cherished, the enstrangement hurt you really bad and has made you scared and running for the hills. Making you want to believe that you are better off alone and running away from the fear is not the solution, trust me. I have been in the exact same place as you are. I craved for a true lover again, yet I rarely let people into my life and come close to me. Deep inside, I knew it isn’t the solution, and so do you. Start fighting and facing your fears. Give yourself time to heal and move on. Let yourself enjoy and embrace the good, as well as the bad parts of being in love.\\nYou are insecure. This could be because of how you look at yourself as a person, could be a result of a past relationship or scars. It could be an outcome of anything. You need to know that everyone has insecurities and flaws. You need to come to terms with them, and you need to realise that your “true” love will accept them for who you truly are.\\nIn my opinion, there is no way of actually running away from a desire that comes naturally to a human being. It is a part of being human with feelings and desires and expectations. We are driven by the need to be loved, supported and cherished, to being an important part of someone’s life. You can ignore it, live in denial, try to be heartless and go on pretending like you don’t need someone.\\nThat, however, is never the real truth. One would always choose love over emptiness and loneliness. Please note, I am not going as far as to say that one isn’t self sufficient. One is perfectly capable of being happy with themselves, one doesn’t necessarily need a partner in order to be happy. Yet, throwing away the opportunity to meet someone wonderful as a consequence of being in denial hardly seems fair.\\nYou just need to conquer your fears, realise what you truly, really want. What your soul really wants, and it will all start to fall back into place.\\nPs: I know the above things sound like they are easily said than done, yet I have been in this position several times. I have had a chance to be in love more than once, and have been heartbroken and helpless and in denial too (denial being my favourite coping mechanism), yet things always fall back into place. I learnt to have faith in what I really want and am still in the process of facing my fears and insecurities.

I\\'m saying whether you CAN find and love another has more to do with choice and attitude than chronology.\\nSociety does have harsher standards of appearance for women, I get that. Unfair but true. So…\\nThere are things you can do to improve and preserve your looks, beginning with health. Clean diet, losing any bad health habits, exercise in fresh air, hydration, good sleep, coconut oil in your food and slathered on your body until it soaks in, preferably daily, enough sun, avoiding unnecessary chemicals in your body and on it… and so on.\\nHealth is also, perhaps even more, about your heart and mind. It flows from the inside out. A woman who is happy and confident within herself will be more resilient physically and emotionally, and far more attractive than otherwise. Suggestion: the first thing you can do is to review what you have learned along the way, and who you have become and whether you want to change anything or not. Give yourself time - after seven years together, you probably need at least six months to a year to reset and get comfortable being you. In a relationship, we often lose too much of ourselves and need to find the true Self again. Accept and love yourself for who you are, leaving room to grow, and expect any prospective partner to do likewise. If he doesn\\'t, he\\'s not for you.\\nAnd give him the same consideration. Love him as he is, or walk away. The alternative is worse - each of you feeling desolate, alone and rejected in the same house, even in the same bed.\\nI know this well.\\nThe other side of this is, be your authentic self, welcome his authentic self, treat each other well (and yourselves), and see where it goes. Love and be lovable.\\nLife doesn\\'t offer guarantees, but does have opportunities. And as long as you\\'re still breathing, you\\'re not done.', 'date': 'Apr 10, 2020', 'user_name': 'Jacobus DeRottmann', 'view': 17, 'upvote': 0}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

This is why video games are so popular. Virtual reality (or dreams) are a world where we have more control over outcomes. We get to rig the game. Who doesn’t want that? We feel no pain, can ignore problems and postpone life decisions. But be careful, drugs do the same thing. Spend a designated amount of time dreaming or doing what you like but schedule in other things here in reality as well. You don’t want to miss out on paying bills or interacting with loved ones now, those usually bite you down the road.\\nSchedule some creative time as well, here in reality. This may help you not feel like “real life sucks” so much. I like to build in 2 hrs a week where I clear the table and just sketch as the evening sunlight pours through the dining room window. I started about a year ago, self-teaching myself on YouTube (there are thousands of videos on this). They don’t even have to be that good, but I heavily recommend it. I sketch trees, cabins, mountainous landscapes and design weird little homes made out of new materials or ideas. Doesn’t earn me a cent or really do much for the world but its a major stress reliever and very healthy for my mind. It’s also a way to bridge the gap between reality and fantasy.\\nCreate something with an idea and story behind it. Sometimes I draw something like a castle with soldiers outside preparing their camps and tents for training or little villagers in a marketplace exchanging goods. I like to imagine what they’d be talking about, the sports they’d bet over like knight duels and the bar maids debating whether men were worth the trouble! Merchants desperately forcing their goods in your face and a plump friar perusing the area for a listening ear. Put in details like the old bearded man sitting on a barrel smoking a pipe and dozing off, a scruffy dog moving from table to table seeing if any vendors will throw him a piece of meat and a large cook chasing off a couple of kids poking around at the cakes on her table.

If you are a good person, then your life is going to become the most difficult. However the facts we must consider:\\nHe is not going to leave his wife and kids for you even if he claims he loves you. This is unfair to the wife and the kids too, they do not deserve this.\\nIf you have confessed your love, you can become his source of pleasure, he can give you anything but not his name. Now, it's your choice you want to spend all your life as his secret lover or you want to move on in your life with a man who can accept you in front of society.\\nIt seems easy to say that we can spend our lives secretly. Then we should ask ourselves, what about kids? will he allow you to have kids? or if he allows, are you sure, he will accept them in front of society that they are his kids? What about your kid's future. Or Are you ready to not have any kid, because you love that person? What if, when you will fell ill or need emotional support and he is busy with his first wife and kids?\\nWhere some religions allow a man to have more than one wife, it depends more on society. you should see, Has he that much courage to accept you in front of society and make his wife understand? Is he capable of giving both of you the equal place? Is he ready to accept that he loves someone else and that person is not his wife?\\nDo you have that much courage to face the society who easily blame on the second woman but ignore the involvement of a man in it?\\nBeing in love with a married man who is living with his other family happily in front of society is equal to not at all in a relationship. He cannot be with you not in your failures and not in your success. He cannot be with you when you need him.\\nYou can surely fell in love with a man or a woman who is already taken and that’s okay. But you have to see whether they are using you like the enjoyment of some moments and then you have to sleep alone, feel alone or they ready to sacrifice their social image for you.\\nIf they are not interested in you, then you should never confess to them about your feelings. no house should be broken because of you, you will heal gradually, everything will be fine and there will be someone who will love you and give you all that you deserve.\\nI am adding a question to this post, Is it possible for a married man to genuinely fall in love with someone else?\", 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020', 'user_name': 'Naz Khaliq', 'view': 55, 'upvote': 2}, 1: {'answer': '', 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020', 'user_name': 'Natalie Marino', 'view': 'error', 'upvote': 0}, 2: {'answer': \"If he a honest man who have lost his wife or wife have betrayed him then he needs to be loved.

You can have her well up a little bit afterwards as they come down during the pillow talk as they discuss what this means going forward (if she's the really weak, overly empathetic, cliched, and agonizingly boring type of female character) because that is the climax (lol) of the emotions she's been building up. A sequence of events directly lead to that point, she’s not crying out of nowhere on step one.\\nAlso this isn't how shy people act. They generally don't offer their heart, vulnerability, and body all at once when its risky. That’s a bold move, not a shy one. It'd be more gradual, with actual tact, because they are uncertain or fearful of a negative outcome.\\nAs it stands...she doesn't seem to have any agency. Just another boring, laughably overly-vulnerable plot device just throwing herself to the whims of another character with power over her. A real human would attempt to retain some measure of control over the situation. Take what you have here and pace this farther apart, have the ILY come either in an earlier conversation that eventually leads to this (that’s her boyfriend, this is a natural conversation to have), or after they do the deed when its already blatently clear that they have something deeper and she has less to lose by revealing such a thing.\\nAs for his reaction, it depends on where you want this scene to go. He can react a number of ways even with a fixed moral alignment. You need a gameplan first, otherwise it's just bad fanfiction. Do you want them together? Then he likes her and goes for it. Do you want conflict? Then he doesn't like her but goes for it anyway to protect her feelings, and is now torn and has to deal with that. Is he unflappably good? Then he kindly rejects her and she has to accept that. It all depends on what you, as the writer, want out of this and how it relates to the greater narrative.\\nCharacters serve the story, not the other way around. The way this is setup it sounds kinda shoehorned, you may not even need a romantic subplot if you dont have plans of doing anything with it (if you did, you wouldn't be asking this). Does this even have a real, meaningful impact or is she just another generic motivational plot device for the other character? If it's the latter…just spare your reader and put her on the bench where she belongs so you can focus on actual characters.\", 'date': 'Apr 12, 2020', 'user_name': 'Shane Crisci', 'view': 20, 'upvote': 0}}, 'topic_list': ['Kissing', 'Romance (love)', 'Girlfriends', 'Love Life Advice', 'Adult Dating and Relationships', 'Love', 'Relationship Advice', 'Dating Advice', 'Dating and Relationships', 'Interpersonal Interaction']}\n",

How can you tell? When our loved one does something that triggers our fear or our hurt, we become upset with them, often getting angry or threatening to leave them. This is total self-interest and has nothing to do with love. Love is an action .. not a feeling, and certainly not a feeling of being attached to someone.\\nThe Buddhist concept of love and compassion deals with slowly developing awareness through meditation, and gradually becoming able to extend that “being in the moment” to our daily living activities. And rather than focusing on ourselves, we are striving to be aware of everything .. both inside ourselves and outside ourselves. And responding to what we see others needing .. helping with kindness and generosity. And for our own uncomfortable emotions, relaxing with them and accepting them and then refocusing our awareness off ourselves. As opposed to the selfish nature of romantic love, Buddhists strive to be unselfish in their awareness, their attitudes, and in their chosen actions.\\nI do want to comment on attachment. It is not desirable to attend to our attachment too much since life doesn’t always meet what we want, and then our attachments become the cause of our suffering. Just as being attached in “love” to a person always ends up causing us pain at times. The other thing to understand is that even for an enlightened person (we are taught .. I cannot speak from personal experience), our attachments, aversions and desire never go away. What happens is that the person changes how they react to them .. through awareness, relaxation, and acceptance, these emotions no longer get their hooks into the person and no longer control the person. In fact, apparently the enlightened person can be quite amused at the presence of attachments and aversions .. and their failure to control the person. So you don’t get rid of these things … you “reframe” how you respond to them.', 'date': 'Apr 12, 2020', 'user_name': 'Ann Patrick', 'view': 16, 'upvote': 0}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

This addresses the difficulty that a female of 15 would have in raising a child, since hunting and gathering for sustenance has been replace by a more technological work place. Having a child early-on will affect education, and education affects one’s entire life, by the quality of one’s spouse, personal income, and opportunities for offspring.\\nWhat you can do is be aware of the problems that can be associated with early sexual activity, like being victimized by a predator, sexually transmitted disease, and pregnancy.

You can be emotionally triggered by reminders of events, things said or even presents given during the relationship. Let me give you an example.\\nYou said he treated you like crap, so we're gonna use that analogy. Think of the relationship as a huge dump you just took in the toilet. Maybe you flush and it all goes down the toilet, maybe it doesn't. You may have to work harder to get that dump down the toilet so you get the plunger. All gone, right? No…you still have the invisible bacteria in the toilet and the whole bathroom still reeks of that smelly dump you tried to get rid of. You're gonna have to bleach the toilet and maybe light a candle to clear the room. There's leftover stuff from that crappy relationship too.You have to work really hard emotionally to remove that person from your life, just like cleaning a bathroom, to remove traces of them from your life.\\nI suggest you first remove any and everything that was or is a reminder of him, no matter how you feel about said item. You don't need anything to trigger you into thinking that maybe you were wrong or he was great for this or that. Not that he wasn't, he could have been. It's just difficult to make a clean break with constant reminders of the relationship while trying to recover emotionally.\\nSecond, invest all your free time and effort into you. Enjoy life. Make you happy. Be occupied with hobbies or friends. Date new people. Most importantly learn to find one really great thing you like to do alone. Never make it dismal or sad. I went to the movies by myself before quarantine and sure as heck will do it again when it's over. It's nice to go watch a movie without distractions, see what I want to see without compromising to someone's choice of film and not share my popcorn.

You can want a relationship with them, find them extremely attractive and be interested in them but it can only develop into love once you know them intimately. You have only seen the social side of them and possibly filled in the gaps yourself to create a perfect partner who, in reality, doesn't exist.\\nI don't know whether you can avoid being around this person but if you can, do. Also, stop checking their social media, talking about them with mutual friends or imagining any kind of future relationship with them. They are not interested in you and if you hold that in mind, you'll begin to realise that you deserve someone who is.\\nIt does beg the question, why in secret? Have you let them know how you feel? If not, before you give up, tell them. It might be easier to let go of someone if you know without a doubt that they don't feel the same way about you. If they're unavailable then look at it logically. Why have you wasted seven years over someone who is in love with someone else? Think about how you've been fantasising about a relationship ending for your own gains. Either way, don't waste any more time on someone who probably doesn't give you a second thought. Stay away from this person as much as possible.\\nIf you engineered a friendship hoping for more either cool off or drop them as a friend. After seven years, admit to yourself it's never going to happen and keeping them in your life is keeping that hope alive. It isn't healthy, nor is it a natural friendship, whatever rationalisation you give to it. You let go by moving on from whatever is keeping your thoughts enmeshed with them. If it's friendship, drop the friendship. If it's mutual friends, try to widen your friendship circle so that you're spending more time with people who don't know your crush. That way the opportunity to talk about them (and think about them), will lessen. Find any way you can to remove them as much as possible from your life.

Many of us are isolated from those we love and care about because of health concerns. Those of us who are polyamorous may feel even more isolated, since we are probably limited to what partners we can interact with. Us solo poly folks and those who are just dating may not have access to anyone for intimacy or sex. Self-care is important and making sure that not only our physical, but our mental and emotional health are taken care of can be daunting. Add to that, the desire to make sure our partner(s) are taken care of and we may become overwhelmed. What do we do? How can we have healthy sex and intimacy in a time of social distancing?\\nNow I realize that much of what I’m going to talk about requires funds and we don’t all have access to do what it takes to do all of it. However, if you’re reading this, you do have internet access and while physical sex and intimacy may be unattainable, social media has made it possible for us to interact in sexy and intimate ways. Self-distancing doesn’t mean zero contact, it just means zero physical contact. Get creative! Find ways to connect with those you desire by other means than in person.\\nMost of us are familiar with the five love languages, words of affirmation, time, gifts, acts of service and physical touch. I suggest we start with these. Identify what your love language is (it could be a combination of several. For me it’s time and touch) and what are your partner(s) love languages. Then find ways to fulfill those needs without physical contact (yes, touch is the hard one). For those of use who are isolated, letting our partners know what we need is imperative. What follows are a few ideas on how to get through all this. Share the ones that resonate with you with those who love and care about you. If you aren’t sure what resonates with them, ask. Request that they participate with you in creating a long-distance intimate and sexual connection.\\nWords of Affirmation: This is pretty easy. Taking the time to send texts and messages telling your loved ones how important they are to you is a given. You can also go old school and send them a letter or card detailing your desire and love for them. Use programs like Marco Polo to send videos of you speaking to each other. If they enjoy dirty and or sexy talk, make a recording talking to them that they can play during masturbation.\\nTime: This means quality time. Find things you can do via social media and other platforms. Playing games, watching movies, watching porn and spending time together, even if it’s online can be enriching and fulfilling. Have meals together, via Skype or Zoom. Set the time and dates and stick to them.\\nGifts: While it may seem difficult to give gifts while being distance, remember, Amazon (and others) still deliver. Send cards, small gifts and things you know they’ll love to them on a regular basis. They don’t have to be expensive, just things that resonate with them.\\nService: This is a little harder, since much of service is about being physically present. Many of the previously mentioned ideas can constitute service. Also, you can do something like order dinner and have it delivered to them. If you’re not in total lock down you can bringing them dinner personally. And if you are in total lockdown you can make gift certificates of the things you’ll do for them when this crisis is over.\\nTouch: This is the hardest of all. And where you can be the most creative. Mutual masturbation, with verbal descriptions of where and how you are touching them. There are some sex toys that can be operated remotely. Buy each of you one and take turns controlling the toys. Send virtual hugs and strokes on a daily basis. This is one time where it may be appropriate to send explicit photos (with permission of course).\\nAnd, don’t forget to take care of yourself. Self-pleasure is more than jacking off. It’s taking time for a long bath. It’s being intimate with yourself, by watching a sexy movie, reading a book that turns you on or even meditating on sex and sensuality.\\nThese are just a few ideas to keep the sex and intimacy alive while dealing with the pandemic. Sex and intimacy in the time of the coronavirus is possible, if you’re willing to step outside of your preconceived ideas of what constitutes sex and intimacy.', 'date': 'Apr 16, 2020', 'user_name': 'Allena Gabosch', 'view': 58, 'upvote': 0}, 1: {'answer': \"The way you sustain a relationship in the circumstance is for it to have been a real relationship with a solid foundation made of substance.

In the original it was, “if one cannot be both.” It is a bit of literary hyperbole and may have sounded different in the Italian anyway. Obviously governments don’t count on love (as Orwell said, “No one is a patriot about taxes”) though on any given occasion they may cultivate it with varying techniques. Likewise nobody can rule through fear alone for very long, and if they try to they have to put their all into it and write off any desire not to go down in history as monsters. At the same time no state can afford to go without the sanction of fear; even small towns need to put drunkards in a lockup from time to time. However to see what he meant explore how governments use “love” and “fear”. Love is not the same as “romance”; “popularity” is a better description. Other words come along like “consent” and a few others. Even dictatorships need some degree of consent. “Fear” is better described as deterrence as except in blatant tyrannies and not always there, people don’t fear the state all the time. And a well-managed state will have procedures predictable enough to ensure that people in it’s domain know what it wants. For it’s own good as well as for it’s citizens or subjects as fear of an unpredictable threat creates desperation whereas a state that respects a normal persons desire to live a normal life will only need latent fear.', 'date': 'Apr 10, 2020', 'user_name': 'Jason Taylor', 'view': 78, 'upvote': 0}, 1: {'answer': 'I don ‘t have a clue!

Their were no shouts of anger, or yelling in despair. There was certainly no violence of any type or kind.\\nI was very angry, but my anger was ice cold. I simply told her the engagement was terminated, and I was sure she knew the why of it. I also told her a very unforgivable thing. I told her I never wanted to see her, ever again.\\nThen, I quietly closed the door on any relationship we ever had, or ever would have.\\nI have seldom ever thought of her, ever since. More than forty years have passed, now. I don’t think I have ever felt so badly betrayed in my life.\\nI do not wish her ill. But, even now, I don’t want to see her. I don’t want to hear from her. I refuse to even speak to her. I have no idea where she lives, nor do I want to know.\\nThere’s an old Country Western song I very much enjoy.\\n“You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille,\\nFour hungry children, and a crop in the field.\\nI’ve known some bad times,\\nLived through some sad times,\\nBut, this time your hurtin’ won’t heal.\\nYou picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille.”\\nWhen I was alone, I wept.\\nI hope you have a healthy and pleasant Morning, my friend.', 'date': 'Apr 15, 2020', 'user_name': 'James T.

Sex? Well, if that’s all you want, then I suppose you’ll get whiplash from turning your head around to look at all the hotties that appear before you.\\nSex has become disposable. Meaningless. It’s a commodity and a social status tool.\\nPeople give their bodies away. Or they sell them for peanuts.\\nBeing used and abused physically is no longer seen as a source of shame but as a confirmation of one’s attractiveness and desirability.\\nSo if all you want is to bed as many willing ladies as you possibly can, well, go ahead, then, I suppose. Have fun with that.\\nBut for me, there can be only one.\\nNo, I’m not naive to believe that there’s only ONE “the one”. But even if there are a few out there for me, it’s a big world, so the chance of running into them during my lifetime is exceptionally slim. I would either have to get extremely lucky early on, or else I’d have to give up and perhaps settle for “less”.\\nExcept, I don’t settle for less. I don’t jump into bed with just anyone who’ll have me.\\nA woman could be looking like my wildest dream come true; sex on legs, and I wouldn’t give a shit if she didn’t have those other qualities I seek.\\nAnd what are those? Well, I can’t deny that good looks are a nice bonus.\\nBut physical beauty fades over time. Not to mention that, the more beautiful a woman is, the more interest there will be in her. So regardless of whether I’m secure enough in my own manhood or not, the reality is that she’ll be the one who has to deal with a constant stream of offers from horny men. And with lots of choice comes less responsibility…\\nI’m not saying that all beautiful women can’t be trusted to stay faithful, but it’s like buying a really expensive, flashy car. Everyone wants to ride in it, and you can’t park it anywhere, because it’ll probably be stolen while you’re away from it.\\nNot that it matters much because my taste in beauty has never been the glamorous model type. I can appreciate extraordinarily beautiful women (and men) not to mention the sheer effort and time that many of them put in to look like that, but the woman I want isn’t someone whose greatest priority is her appearance.\\nIf she’s beautiful to me, that’s all that matters. She could be considered plain or boring by everyone I know, and I couldn’t give a flying fuck.\\nAnd that’s because her beauty, to me, isn’t the makeup or the clothes she wears. Nor is it her popularity or her professional success and income.\\nAll I care about is how she makes me feel.\\nI need a woman who makes me feel wanted. Someone I can trust.\\nSomeone who’s responsible when she needs to be, but also able to relax and be silly.\\nA woman who doesn’t back away when I show affection for her, but instead feels worthy of being loved by me. A woman who can give as much as she gets.\\nI’d like her to have her feet firmly planted on the ground, but her head shouldn’t be afraid of visiting the clouds.\\nI want a real woman. A loyal, faithful, trustworthy and equal life companion.\\nSomeone I can put my life in the hands of and gladly put my own life on the line for to protect.\\nA lover, a partner and most importantly, a friend.\\nThat’s what I want.

Personally, that’s him flaunting that he doesn’t want you in that way, so I say ditch the ass hat and find someone who won’t do that to you. Never ever EVER depend on a man for your own happiness. Get away from that player, and as far away from him as you can. If he loves another woman, he’s not in love with you, and that’s basically him giving you a hint to move on. Now, if you’re homeless and need a place to stay, that could be a reason he wants you to stay with his family. The opposite of love, isn’t hate. The opposite of love… Is INDIFFERENCE. Basically, he’s a player, and wants nookie with this other chick, and only saying he loves her to gauge your reaction. He’s playing you for a fool, and he thinks that if you stay with his family, he can have the power and control to both manipulate you and use you as a body to bang when the girl he supposedly loves doesn’t have time for him. If he was your boyfriend, you’d be a PRIORITY… NOT AN OPTION. Don’t stay with his family, don’t believe his corny lies, and don’t let him play you like a fool.

We expect it to be something extremely wonderful and rare to find.

This will only highlight the mistake the wife has made by marrying her husband.\\nThe reason I make these observations is that it generally comes about as a 3 sided relationship, both the mistress & wife get very little out of it, if there are children they get even less from this unbalanced set up, unfortunately the children are always the ones that pay the price from the loss of time with their father, which is wrong & has an effect on their development..\\nThose people that think that this is an acceptable arrangement have I would suggest got to take a long hard look at themselves, as it's truly selfish & unfair to think that a three side relationship is something that they can get away with..\\nThe fact that they think they can do it without any repercussions or paying the price for their behavior towards those they're supposed to love is also very questionable, which suggests they have a serious character flaw which is a huge problem\", 'date': 'Apr 12, 2020', 'user_name': 'Lesley Graham', 'view': 42, 'upvote': 1}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

Those actions will certainly make the admirer feel drained and lose self-esteem. They may feel like they’re lying, or they may simply want reciprocation and wonder how much they have to do to get it.\\nThat’s not love.\\nOr it may be that your partner has low self esteem and everything you do or say isn’t enough, so you start feeling like you’re not being a successful partner.\\nOr maybe you’re deeply lonely or want a sex partner or need to be “with someone” for social status reasons. That’s something springing from within, but the self esteem issue itself is the issue; it will invade other aspects of your life.\\nThere are other ways that relationship patterns can need adjustment.\\nSo if you are feeling like what your partners have required is draining and erodes you’re self esteem, you may want to reevaluate entirely. If you can the easiest and quickest way to do this is with a therapist, because love patterns are established early and sometimes hard for us to see ourselves.\\nGood luck, you don’t have to suffer.', 'date': 'Apr 11, 2020', 'user_name': 'Jessica Margolin', 'view': 69, 'upvote': 0}}, 'topic_list': ['Self-Esteem', 'Self-Confidence', 'Love']}\n",

There are so many abused and neglected children. My mother never showed any warmth to me and never missed a chance to show me how little I mattered. My sister also learned to treat me the same way. I knew they were wrong and I was the only mentally healthy one in the family. We were very well off and she was a very well respected executive with a large bank, until she retired. People were always telling me how lucky I was to have such a great mother. HA! I stayed connected anyway and loved them and was always there for them. I married a man just like my mother even though he pretended to adore me until after we were married. He joined our successful family business that I had started with my my family. While I was extremely ill with heart issues and breast cancer he convinced my whole family I was mentally ill and an alcoholic. They never told me this or that he was going to walk away with everything I had worked my whole life for. They have never acknowledged that he did anything wrong and the stress of this almost killed me. I ended up in the hospital after open heard surgery from the stress of trying to get them to help me for 2 years. So no parents do not always love their children. If I had known they could do such a thing I would have put them out of my life many years ago. I am much happier since I took out the trash.

The way I see it is two folds. You either surrender to your insecurities or you work on your weakness and sometimes this means facing your biggest fear.\\nNo one likes being insecure. I went down this path once both in my relationship and on top of that I wasn’t getting much jobs to justify my ability to support a family. I had to be creative in fear of losing my kids and my wife. But how does one become creative? The good thing about life is it gives us clues on what it is that we need to work on in order to feel safe and secure. Nobody likes to lose someone they love, but there are things that are beyond our control. And that is the control of whether or not our partner will leave us for another. My advice is ground your self. Be strong and be brave. You have to remember love works both ways. If he/she doesn’t see you the same way you see him/her, then you will only suffer later on. If you suspect that your partner is cheating, maybe confront the situation and show him/her that you can’t keep feeling this way. If you are suffering from doubts and always thinking the worst, you need to commune with the self and be prepared for what can happen if things don’t work out the way you want it to go. In the end you will thank yourself that you faced your fear and you will rebuild your confidence again by addressing the situation.

She will be stunned. Expect that. She might be speechless for a moment. She might ask you why you called her mom. Tell her what you said here. Leave out the part about your biological mother. This is about your feelings toward this woman. Then keep calling her that. Even when you are angry with her or she with you. Start tonight, this minute, this second in your head. Leave the “step” out of your thoughts. And do it while she is living.\\nWait! What?! Where did that come from?\\nI have 5 older brothers (3 biological and 2 cousins who might as well have been). My sperm donor didn't want these 6 children (his own 4 and his wife's 2 nephews). He was verbally and physically abusive (Mom only said it happened once, but we all know how abuse works). Plus pretty sure there was rape involved as well (she never said this, but the timing of 2 brothers and the fact that in 4 years there would have been 5 children if one hadn't been miscarried). He was an alcoholic. It took my mother 4 years to leave him. 3 months after my birth. This was in 1971, in Texas. She was a single mother to 6 kids. 1981 we move to Oklahoma and she meets my dad in March, they got married in September. My dad was a gentle man. He was supportive and kind and loved not only his wife but his 6 children (especially his favorite the daughter). He stood beside us and behind us. He was what a Dad should be. We never called him that. We all called him Larry. That was his name. We had the feelings but we didn't know how to express them. We did and still do love our dad. He died in 1993 just before my 22nd birthday (literally 3 days before) and we buried him the day I turned 22. The day he died all 6 of us hugged each other and for the first time in unison called him Dad. I know he heard us from Heaven, but he should have heard it while he was with us in body, not just spirit. We all regret that one thing.\\nSo yeah, while your Mom can appreciate the fact that you feel this way, tell her. Use the words you want to use for her. Mom, mommy, mother, ma, mama, say it in French “ma mere”, say it in Spanish “mi madre”, say it in Japonese if you want “watashinhaha” just say it. And tell her you love her too.\", 'date': 'Apr 10, 2020', 'user_name': 'Rhonda Grensberg', 'view': 153, 'upvote': 5}}, 'topic_list': ['Stepmoms', 'Advice About Mothers', 'Mothers-in-Law', 'Mother-Child Relationships', 'Mothers', 'Dreams and Dreaming', 'Family Relationships and Dynamics', 'Family', 'Parenting', 'Love', 'Personal Question']}\n",

Lois Lane and Lana Lang.\\nNOTE: This answer is pretty long\\nLois and Lana are kinda like the DC equivalent of Betty and Veronica in the Superman mythos. At least if you ask me.\\nLois Lane is the city girl that Clark had a crush on but Lois wasn’t exactly interested in him.\\nAlthough the two eventually get married\\nand had a son\\nShe does whatever it takes to get a story, even putting herself in mortal danger, pretty much making her the definitive comic book damsel in distress.\\nI swear, it’s like a bunch a people over at DC have some kind of bondage fetish. Then again, there was Wonder Woman, but i digress…\\nLana on the other hand was the country girl who was smitten with him from the beginning. Hell, in some books i’ve read, she Clark was Superman WAY before Lois caught on. Then again, they did grow up together.\\nThese two have literally fought each other over Superman’s affections back in the Silver Age.\\nBut aside from these two, let’s move on to some others.\\nLori Lemaris\\nProbably one of the strangest of Superman’s love interests. Why? We’ll come back to that after some backstory. Clark first Lori back in college when they both attended Metropolis University and he helped her stop when she lost control of her wheelchair.\\nThey both started dating each other.\\nOne day, they both visited an aquarium where there was an accident and Lori ended up in the grasp of an octopus. Now you would think that’s bad, right? However, both Lori and the octopus remain rather calm about the whole situation. Soon enough, the octopus lets her go and swims away.\\nOf course, Clark rescues her and she just makes up an excuse about him scaring it off.\\nLater on, Clark even worked up the nerve of proposing to her (way too soon dude).\\nYeah, Clark, one small problem with all that…\\nNOTE: This is what i was talking about earlier\\nSHE’S A FREAKING MERMAID!!!\\nYes, that’s right people. THE MAN OF STEEL HOOKED UP WITH A MERMAID.\\nYeah, it turns out that Lori was sent by her people to view the progress of the surface world and her time was up, so she had to head back.\\nAlthough they do share one last kiss tho.\\nAs a side note, she even appears in the Young Justice cartoon!\\nMaxima\\nMaxima is a alien conqueror from the planet Almerac who travels to Earth to make Superman her mate, deeming him the only man worthy of her affections. She first appeared in Action Comics (1938) Issue #645\\nHowever, her time on Earth did soften her up more.\\nShe also appeared in Superman: The Animated Series which was part of the DCAU (DC Animated Universe).\\nAnd that just leaves us with one more lady: New 52 Wonder Woman.\\nHell, even in the Kingdom Come storyline, Superman and Wonder Woman end up getting hitched and have kids of their own. I’m aware that Supes and Wondy hooked up in Dark Knight Strikes Again but WE DON’T SPEAK OF THAT BOOK. At least i don’t.\\nI probably missed a couple of girls but as of now, those are the love interests that Supes has had over the years.', 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020', 'user_name': 'Oneseus Mattan Beh', 'view': 756, 'upvote': 4}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

And i thought this went for me dating anyone else…and Its been 23 years. It was something huge over two people wanting to date, fuck and figure out if she loved him as much as he loved her. So if this guy wanted to talk about love then he must have been serious. She used aliases which confused me…Zaineb Ali/Kristi Ruiz…Jessica and her name is Yesenia Kristen Vega now we are in our forties and i wrote to the FBI about these White Power neighbors trying to enforce Jim crow laws and extort my biological family to fund the Klu Klux Klan but I haven’t received any response…it was her birthday party and my high school faculty and friends were trying to make amends because since i was a child these white power neighbors and police have told the schools to change my A’s to C’…and I should have been Salutorian while the sister who was adopted with me and molested me to help this extortion and coverup of their killing my uncle Cesario Rodriguez Jr an undercover Police Officer among other crimes to extort money from the Media so the KKK being part of ‘the network’ (al Queda) could carry out terrorism to get the USA out of the middle east, bring the holocaust to the USA, and slavery back to the world…But in high school she would walk by my English Class with a smile like looking at me was pleasant… and when i think about her…but these people were serious and I wanted to publish these books to create a beautiful life for Yesenia Kristen Vega and I…but as a kid many of the neighbors and people outside my family taught me my body is worthless for sex and love because of kidney disease and the subsequent kidney transplant…I wanted to figure out what happened before I moved on and I don’t like being told i have to marry the adopted sister who molested me or i have to obey jim crow laws or marry into the family of the White Power neighbors who are extorting my biological family and covering up Caltrans murders (they sold the assault rifle and used my name to frame me) the murder of my uncle, my cousin Charlie…various other acts of terror they would just use my name and the police would help them cover it up because they wanted some of this fairytale money…but holding a gun to someone’s head and saying if they ever date or marry isn’t a joke. I was lucky to kiss Yesenia Vega and I would be lucky if the Police, FBI or Justice system investigated anything of what I say and allow me to marry my Rainbeau or know she and all our families are safe and i could try dating someone else. but talking about love on your first date is huge many people would be lucky…I hoped to lose weight and some miracle pill would help my manhood increase by 5 inches and put a ring on the lady’s finger and a smile on her face when i publish my books and they hit bookshelves…I wanted to talk about marriage like when i was 5 I told her that someday i would marry her…and as that sister walked me home she said never go back to the Vega home because they are evil…and I was shy and people are supposed to trust their family not molest them and help assclowns extort their biological family.

Although not necessarily in the same way that humans do, but research has shown that elephants do have high level emotional capacities, which is very clear through their actions.\\nFor example, elephants have been found to stop on their migrations and mourn at the sites of deaths of other elephants from their herd, even when years have passed since the death. In some instances, elephants will remain in these positions for days mourning their loss. I don’t know if that would be called ‘love’ in the way that we think of it, but I definitely believe it indicates an emotion along those lines.

He could have been waiting for the best moment to let go, or to ease out of his current commitment. There could be various reasons for this…\\nHe shortly started realizing that the relationship did not fulfill his every need\\nMost people in relationships are in it for a reason… it is commonly said that everyone has an agenda. His agenda may not have been your agenda, even though he may have made statements that would reflect that you both had the same goals. Besides, agendas can mutate or change over time.\\nHe may have been second-guessing his decision to leave for a long time, partly because he might have been trying to avoid hurting you, he continued to stay in the relationship.\\nHis sudden cheating may not have been as sudden as you think. He simply suddenly decided to take a chance and “do what is best for himself”.\\nThe fact that your partner is planning to marry soon may just be his way of expressing love to the other person. It does not mean that he is totally aware of what real love is, just what he is feeling and experiencing at the moment. Neither does it mean that there is perfection in the new relationship.\\nAs you now know, time is not necessarily a factor of relationship perfection or compatibility. He may be awakened by this new relationship, reliving the great experience that accompanies a new beginning. For this reason, he may feel that he is making the right choices by committing (moving in, marriage) in order to preserve his new experiences.\\nI hope it helps for you to know that your relationship was probably over before you knew it was, hence there is not much you could have done to stop it.

Your parents and you are different people but that will never make the people that you associate with any less in value because your parents can’t accept said, persons.\\nIf your boyfriend treats you right despite being 15 years older then you, then screw what others think even if they are your blood. Your parents may reject you for staying with this guy if they don’t like him simply because of his age ( and the fear they’ve instilled in their heads about the negative possibilities this person may bring for you) but do they really care about you genuinely if they do wind up rejecting for being with this dude?

      "{'question_author': 'Barbara Young Capalbo', 'no_of_view': '59,170', 'answer_count': 100, 'question_title': 'What is it about your pet that makes you love them as much as you do?', 'no_of_follower': 11, 'create_time': 'Sep 12, 2019', 'respond': {0: {'answer': 'I currently have two pets (a cat and a dog) and have had three more (two dogs and a cat) that have passed away. I’d say there are three things that make me love them as much as I do. In no particular order, those three things are:\\nTrust. They trust me and I trust them. It isn’t just me that thinks so. I’ve had a number of vets over the years and each one has commented that when it comes to uncomfortable exams and procedures, my pets look at me and if I say it is ok, they let the vet do what she needs to do. It isn’t just letting vets do what they need to do. There have been a few occasions where my dogs have been attacked and I have jumped in to save them. When there is a threatening situation, my dogs stand behind me. I’m the alpha male by default - I’m 6′4″.\\nLoyalty. As much as my dogs are very social and play with the neighboring dogs, when it comes to a human taking them for a walk away from me, that will never happen. I was in the hospital for a few days when I had my first dog and a friend came over to take her for a walk. They knew each other for years. Natasha was excited to go but stopped at our mailbox. She would go no farther in case I came home. I received my second dog (Calico) when her owner moved. Before that, Calico would run away from her first owner fairly often when the avalanche canons would go off in the town. She ran away to my house where she would be safe which was about a mile and a half away. The cannons were just as loud at my house but she felt safe there. My current dog refuses to let me out of her sight. She is always waiting at the window for me. One time I had to be away for about eight hours and she let my aunt she needed to go outside. When my aunt called her back in, she refused. Instead she went to the front of the house and waited at the top of the driveway for me. My aunt wasn’t mobile enough to go outside to get her. My cats show their loyalty by hiding when strangers come and sticking by my side all the other times. The loyalty isn’t a one way street. Years ago I got a new job in a different state. I had two dogs and a cat at the time and knew it would be difficult to find a house to rent with that many pets. So we would be together, I bought an RV and the four of us traveled halfway across the country to our new home. We lived in an RV park for several months until I found a permanent home.\\nAffection. Cats have a reputation for being aloof but that hasn’t been my experience. Both the cats I’ve had (Little Guy and Kitty) have been very affectionate. Sure you cater to their needs but they give love in return. It is funny thinking about it. Most of the day a cat will be off on their own. But in the evening, they come out and sit on your lap or put their head on your arm and then when it is time, follow you to the bedroom and share your bed. Sure they are gone by the morning (most of the time) but it is the thought that counts. As for dogs, well everyone know they are affectionate. If I’m not snuggling them, they are snuggling me.\\nTrust, loyalty, and affection. You can’t ask for much more.', 'date': 'Sep 30, 2019', 'user_name': 'Dave Nelson', 'view': 259, 'upvote': 6}, 1: {'answer': '', 'date': 'Feb 8, 2020', 'user_name': 'Jamie Hall', 'view': 'error', 'upvote': 0}, 2: {'answer': \"Last year my dog jumped off a chair and hurt his back, was completely paralyzed. I broke down in the emergency vets office, I hadn't cried in years.

One day after a couple of weeks he moved his head trying to stand up, then eventually stood up, then started running although a bit funny. Today it is like it didn't happen and I am thankful I didn't take the first vets recommendation of putting him down.\", 'date': 'Sep 13, 2019', 'user_name': 'Emila Irus', 'view': 10500.0, 'upvote': 0}, 3: {'answer': 'There are so many answers to this.

      "{'question_author': 'Dustin Darby', 'no_of_view': '882', 'answer_count': 1, 'question_title': 'How frequently are couples financially cheating on each other?', 'no_of_follower': 3, 'create_time': 'Apr 10, 2020', 'respond': {0: {'answer': 'Finances are considered to be the number one cause of divorce in the United States. The smartest thing my wife and I did in our marriage was maintain separate finances.\\nI have my paycheck. She has her paycheck. I have my bank account. She has her bank account. I am responsible for bills A, B, C, and D. She is responsible for bills X, Y, and Z. I could not tell you for the life of me how much she makes on a paycheck, or how much money is in her account. It is none of my business.\\nWe both respect each other’s financial contributions this way. Because I cover mortgage, electric, gas, and water, she knows that the home is always taken care of. No utilities get turned off. It’s just something she never has to worry about, despite the fact she knows that it costs real money.\\nIn contrast, she takes care of things like cell phones, internet, and groceries. There is always food on the table. I know she does her share. I don’t question how she spends her money.\\nUnless the marriage is sustained by a single income, the concept of “our money” is what causes the fights. Both people feel entitled to use it. Both people have different ideas what it should be spent on. Both people feel upset if the other party uses the money for something else instead. Running it as separate finances, we have had exactly two fights about money, both of which were the same.\\n“Can I get some extra money from you for X bill?”\\n“Sure.” *shares money*\\n*Immediately notice 200 things the other person is spending money on that is either not bills, or is clearly in excess.*\\n“Now I am angry, because I gave you what little discretionary spending money I have leftover after my bills, sacrificing my own ability to do X-thing-I-enjoy, and you said you needed it for bills, but in reality you only needed it because you overspent on Y-thing-you-enjoy. I must skip lunch for the week, but in exchange you were able to go out to the movies. This is not a fair arrangement.”\\nSeparate finances allow each person to do their fair share. Separate finances allow each person to still do things they enjoy as well, provided they can budget properly. I know that during the summer, if I turn the Air Conditioning up 1 degree, it costs me X extra dollars, so I ask myself, do I want to spare that money, or do I need to save that for this alternative expense.\\nWhat most people want to call “financial cheating” is typically just one party feeling as though they are more entitled to the money than their partner. Whether it manifests in hiding money from your partner, lying about expenses, or spending money without telling them, it ultimately comes down to the idea that one person thinks they should have greater control over the money than what their partner does.\\nThe reality of money is this. There will never be enough money to do everything you want to do. When it comes to money, whether you’re living on social security or whether you’re a millionaire, your wallet is no match for your imagination. There will have to be some decisions where you say “We can’t afford that.” Friction starts in the marriage when one party keeps on giving up what they want, and the other party starts to have greater control of the money so that they can get more of what they want. This is not about money wasted; it can be very real and challenging decisions, such as “There is not enough money for both the electric bill and the groceries. How will we cut one of these two very essential bills down?” But if both parties do not 100% agree, then there will be problems.\\nSeparate finances. When my wife came home with a brand new car, I couldn’t get angry with her for wasting money. It was her money. Her paycheck that she worked for, and that she balanced out while taking care of all her other obligations. Good for her. She scrimped and saved and budgeted and now she has something nice to show for it. In contrast, my car is a heap of junk, but I got our mortgage paid off 15 years early, because I hate being in debt. Separate finances makes each individual accountable for what they earn, what they spend, and how they budget. No more sense of being entitled to your partner’s money. No more fighting because your spouse doesn’t agree with your priorities. Two people who help each other financially by carrying their fair share of the expenses, but who also allow each other to see direct personal benefits from efforts to budget, save, and sacrifice.', 'date': 'Apr 10, 2020', 'user_name': 'Caleb Davis', 'view': 19, 'upvote': 0}}, 'topic_list': ['Married Couples', 'Couples', 'Finance', 'Marriage', 'Love', 'Relationship Advice', 'Dating and Relationships']}\n",

So after a week with no answer I told her that I will take it as a no and if she feels any different she can come talk to me.\\nI didn't really like her so I moved in a matter of hours to start flirting with another girl (I'm not like this any more, I've changed).\\nThis whole thing came and bit me in the ass when she got obsessed with me. I know it sounds far fetched but her friends told me that all she ever talked about is me and she always used to stare at me and follow me around. This led to even more rumours and teasing. Which I didn't really care about but she was really disheartened by them\\nFor 2 years this went on and I don't know if she moved on or not because I changed schools. For the 2 years that this went on every relationship I got into made her cry. Before you sympathise with her, she was very shallow and rejected me when I was fat and became obsessed with me when I became one of the hot guys in school.\\nThis was a funny experience for me.\", 'date': 'Apr 15, 2020', 'user_name': 'Captain Crazy', 'view': 13, 'upvote': 1}, 1: {'answer': 'I never had any this type of experiences in my life because I was studying in girls college since from my school days 💃💃💃\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nThanks for A2A', 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020', 'user_name': 'Priya', 'view': 59, 'upvote': 2}}, 'topic_list': ['Crushes', 'Love', 'Dating and Relationships', 'Survey Question']}\n",

I already knew some of the members from attending the last two sessions.\\nDavid walked in, surveyed the scene, and headed straight towards the seat next to me. We were sitting on adjoining sides of the corner of the conference table (L)\\nI thought the subject matter—four of Plato’s Dialogues—to be turgid, and had read only two. The discussion moved along vigorously nevertheless. I loved being at a literary “salon” on a Saturday afternoon.\\nMost in the group agreed to meet afterwards at an Italian restaurant for an early supper. As our informal procession wound its way downtown at winter dusk, church bells rang as if on cue.\\nI took a seat at one end of the long table. David found the last seat, at the far end on the same side. We weren’t in each other’s sight lines or hearing range during the entire meal.\\nBefore dessert, the person next to me had to leave, and within moments, David grabbed his place.\\nI continued with the animated conversation with the folks at my end of the table, at the same time aware, without looking at him, of the quietly patient gentleman next to me. But he didn’t break into the conversation—and after five minutes, he moved to get up and leave.\\nI put my hand on his elbow and said, “Don’t go yet.” My words—or my touch, expressing recognition—perhaps enough to make him reconsider.\\nSoon after, everyone got up, not quite in unison but close enough.\\nOne explained, “Meeting some friends at seven.”\\nAnother, “See you next time, this was great.”\\nA third, “Have to pick up groceries before the market closes.”\\nAnd within minutes, we were left alone at the table for ten. The waitress asked us if we wouldn't mind vacating; she had to clear the table for the next party.\\nWe moved together to a high top table near the bar, as if we were a couple. That familiar feeling astounded me. It just happened, naturally.\\nDavid politely asked if I had time to stay, not assuming anything. I replied, “These were my only plans, to come to the meeting.” I would have otherwise gone home. I had no one to account to. No one was expecting me there, like before the catastrophe.\\nA fact of my life now, a widow after forty-one years of marriage.\\nWe moved to a high top table for two and ordered coffee. I don’t know what he noticed about me, but I focused on the metal rims of his glasses in the warm light of the bar. We ended up agreeing to go to an early movie, an unusually creative animated feature film from Brazil.\\nBefore I exited his vehicle to get into mine, I noticed his hand resting on the hand brake. Noticed, and stared. He asked for my contact information. Being a member of the group, I trusted him.\\nEven before I walked through my front door, a text from an unidentified number lit up, “I enjoyed your company. Would you perchance be free next Friday?”\\nI was surprised. But at the same time open to surprise. I called up a friend and described the evening’s events, then asked, “Marcia, have I actually been on a date?” After all, the last time I had dated was before I was married.\\nHer answer, something like a quick “Hell, yes!”\\nThen this was my first date in forty-five years, at the age of seventy-one.\\nBut I had plans to visit my daughter in New York City that next weekend and texted him in return to “get in touch” after that.\\nIs “Let’s stay in touch” actually code for “I’m letting you down politely but it actually means I’m not interested. No need to call me.” I was unschooled in modern protocols after being married since 1972, a lifetime ago. My courtship back then began with my roommate’s boyfriend who she ditched for another guy, a concert cellist just returned from a European tour (but that’s another story).\\nWould the nice gentleman know the codes and conclude I was “ghosting” him, a term I had heard from my senior friends experienced in online dating?\\nMaybe I blew it.\\n(to be continued)\\nPhoto courtesy of Pixabay\", 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020', 'user_name': 'Barrie Levine', 'view': 309, 'upvote': 27}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

Without speculating on your particular history I see a lot of postings like yours from young people whose parents have separated or divorced.\\n“Wanting to feel loved” also suggests desertion issues. When two people bring their desertion issues into a relationship, both can find themselves feeling very out of balance and anxious with each other, a lot of the time. Positive relationships that last are built around a quite different sense of shared values and a sense of individual “sufficiency.” You can’t build one “whole” person or relationship out of two “insufficient” people. So I’d suggest that there’s some needed growing up to do for both you and the boyfriend. Talk with an adult who seems to offer a good example of positive engagement and balance — perhaps a school guidance counselor. If you need to talk with someone who has mental health professional skills, they may be able to suggest a referral.', 'date': 'Apr 13, 2020', 'user_name': 'Red Lawhern', 'view': 18, 'upvote': 0}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

Perhaps. Did it make a difference in the relationship? Yes. It destroyed it.\\nThings you could do:\\n-Move to her country. This one is tough because moving to different countries all the time can be really tough itself without the hardships of a relationship which probably are there if you are considering moving to her country. I mean if everything is perfect, whynot stay where you are? Do not ever expect exceptions from sociological paradigms in a relationship. If for one second the thought even crosses her mind that you won`t fulfil your responsibilities as a spouse or lover then she will leave you instantly. 99.9% of cases. Then you have the headache of having to move to another country to chase after another girl. Sorry if you find yourself in that situation.\\n-Determine if she really likes you. Is it really worth leaving where you are?\\n-Find another girl. This one takes time depending on how strong your emotion or idealisation of the girl is. You know how men are though. Women tend to be more committed to longer term relationships. It’s the way of the world. Still times change and people change, so maybe you might actually be very committed to this new love of yours. Time will tell-you more than anyone else.\\n-Use long distance strategies. Find closeness in a lack of closeness. Later on in your relationship depending on the type of people you are, you could actually sadly be apart from your new love more than you think. Maybe she has other priorities. Maybe she values you less than other things. Maybe she doesn’t like long distance and wants it to end but can’t express herself the right way because she is too emotional or irrationally neurotic or confused. You can value this though and maybe it is better to get exposed to in a long distance setting. Every opportunity like this is an opportunity for you both to make amends and well develop your love for each other.\\nI sincerely hope you find love which is long lasting. I am blessed to say I have had a lot of short term flings with a lot of women. All kinds. That is paradise for a young man. There is a point of diminishing returns in terms of satisfaction though. In the long-term these cause satiation and I personally found that you start to value more than just sex because you have had sex with so many women. And don’t get me wrong Sex is amazing still there are many other things in a relationship which can also be amazing.\\nEnjoy my sorrow to create your happiness\\nSadly my long distance relationships never materialised into more meaningful relationships.

The first month was great. Great sex, lots of attention, and I felt great! Then I found out she was making other guys feel the same.\\nIn another instance, I was single and pursued another woman I felt was quite attractive. Well she was very attractive, but didn’t have a great personality. We often clashed. We barely began dating before I got sick of her.\\nWhile in another relationship, a woman who I deemed to be a bit less attractive than my current partner caught my attention. We met as friends, joked about hooking up and having wild sex adventures. Let’s call her Linda. After having a meaningless argument with my then girlfriend, I left and ran to Linda. We had wild sex, but it wasn’t long before we realized that our sexual desires were incompatible. Or rather to be clear, I didn’t want phallic objects inserted into my anal cavity.\\nLast but not least, while single yet again and on a dating sight, I connected with a VERY VERY attractive woman. She was an actual model. I didn’t think it would go anyway, but shot my shot anyway and it worked! The problem there was she was frequently traveling, so I wouldn’t see her very often. She also traveled with her male best friend who was also a model — really cool guy. I later found out that she did not cook what so ever, so anything she ate was cooked for her or she ordered. She was also the type to run away from conflict, so when we had a disagreement, she’s change the subject and run away. But the straw that broke the camels back was when I was hanging out with her male best friend one day. In the midst of hanging out, he bent over to get something and his boxers caught my attention. Jokingly I said “Those boxers must be popular, Gina wears that same brand from time to time.” He laughed and said “she needs to stop stealing them from me.”. Ummm what?!\\nLong story short, she’d frequently wear her male best friend’s boxers and shirts, especially to sleep in. When she told me she had feelings for him but he would never act, I took my leave.\\nMoral of these stories, the grass is not always greener on the other side. You’ve put in the time and effort to get to know your current partner. You know many of their likes and dislikes, you know mostly how they think and how they’d react, and you’ve worked to build a foundation. Why trash all that to try your luck with someone you know nothing about except that they’re attractive?\\nHear me out. It’s like playing BINGO and having 4 spaces filled with 1 to go to make a straight and completely line, then throwing your BINGO card away to obtain a new card to start again from scratch.

However, I have many friends across the country who know lots of people who have it, and who know those who have died from it. This leads me to an interesting conclusion. Perhaps this virus is picking the energy it likes to feed upon. This would mean, quite simply, there are those it finds delectable and those who are not so yummy. I think that I am not so tasty to it because I do not fear it. I respect it, but I am just not frightened. I also realize that I have only surrounded myself with friends who are also of this mindset. I think that this may have enabled us to be generating a kind of immunity.\\nTo the virus, I think we become tastier if we are marinating in the powerful emotion of fear. The media is helping whip this fear into a near hysteria, thus enabling the virus to have a feeding frenzy. That is why I am trying to send this message: \"Be the Love.\" This will boost your immunity by simply making your energy less tasty. What do you think of this?

Morally, that includes threesomes, polyamory, and egalitarian polygamy.\\nMorally, I feel when most folks say “polygamy,” they actually mean “polygyny”—a system where men can have multiple wives, but women are forbidden to have multiple husbands. History shows us that polygyny is invariably oppressive. A system that permits men to have a range of action forbidden to women is not moral.\\nThere are two different systems of morality: compassionate morality and Big Bully morality.\\nCompassionate morality is based on empathy and understanding that morality is about not hurting others unnecessarily. If three adults enjoy having consensual sex, and everyone’s happy, it is moral because it doesn’t harm anyone.\\nBig Bully morality is the idea that morals come from lists handed down by an authority, whether that’s Joseph Stalin or God or a person who says he speaks for God or the State itself. Big Bully morality says if the authority tells you it’s immoral, that means it’s immoral, period. If the authority tells you that sex has to be between exactly one man and one woman who are married, then any other kind of sex is wrong. If the authority tells you that it’s morally wrong to let a witch live, then you are morally obligated to kill every witch you find.\\nBig Bully morality is the more primitive morality. It’s the law of the jungle, literally. It’s the law of the chimpanzee troop. Whatever the lead chimp says, goes. Might makes right, and the mightiest decide what is moral and what is not.\\nCompassionate morality is the Golden Rule. It’s human morality. It’s based on the idea that other people might not make the same choices I do, and that’s okay.\\nI believe threesomes, polyamory, and egalitarian polygamy are moral because my moral foundation is compassion, not “obey whatever the strong say.”', 'date': 'error', 'user_name': 'Franklin Veaux', 'view': 923, 'upvote': 86}, 1: {'answer': 'That’s just not fair of you to ask me that.

With time, you will learn to live with that pain, your heart will learn to live with it.\\nIt hurts. It hurts real bad. It stings. There is a pang in your heart every single time you think about them. You care for them that much and you love them that much. You experienced pinnacle of happiness when you were with them, and now when they leave, you experience nadir of sadness. It really hurts because you still care and you will care, even though they are with you or not. Your heart will still care.\\nBut just remember it wasn't easy for them to let you go. Sometimes they leave because they can't see you sad. She left me that way and I completely get her view on this. She cared for me as a real friend and I love her even more. It stings me and I feel how much it would have hurt her too. She asked me to stay away for I can move on, little did she know that she was the one whom I genuinely love after my parents. I am still staying away even after six years, for I want her to be happy. To be guilt free. I can't see her sad any day.\\nWe all know how much it stings us because we experience it. But we all should know how much it would hurt them too. I really care about her and her happiness still. That is what love and care is all about. If it were just distance and time that would make someone unlove, then love would be an easy thing. It isn't. True love will never fade.

I think it depends on your compatibility. Your best friend is probably someone who already loves you for who you are, you share common interests, respect each other, trust each other and get along well… or you wouldn’t be best friends… right? As far as taking it up to the next level- you shouldn’t even try if\\n1) You do not have any physical chemistry. People who become romantic will more than likely become intimate.\\n2) Is this someone that you can see yourself maybe marrying one day? Because most relationships end in break up. If you don’t see this person in your future as your spouse, stay their best friend. If you can-\\n3) Do you want the same things and have similar future goals? Even if they aren’t exact, there can be a balance and if you want somewhat of the same things- you can figure the rest out.\\nSo if this is someone that you love, can see yourself being intimate with, see them in your far future and possibly marrying them- then asking them out is a great idea. If you can’t any or either one of them, then asking them out is a bad idea. It will not end well if there is a breakup or any hurt feelings. If you are all in for asking them out, it doesn’t even matter your age- love is something you do and how you treat someone, not just a feeling. So you can make it work and last forever if it’s truly what you want and you’re willing to work for it.

Likewise, it isn't something that needs to be answered. But I'll answer nonetheless. He lost his feelings. Whether that is sexual or emotional. He lost it.\\nAny feeling, whether that may be love lust or anything, is way too powerfull that guys will commit themselves to the source of their feelings life long. But feelings fade away too. And the rest that happens is comparatively boring. So it is a fantasy that both of the sides weave a story about, and then try to act the fantasy out in regular life.\\nThis is a natural law with men. Even if you argue about a case in which the guy’s feelings haven't faded, then the time limit for their feelings is too high compared to others. This is something that you have to keep in mind.\\nYou haven't completed the second part of your question. But I'll answer nonetheless. When he settles in your city, be like you usually be. There's nothing that will change except your sheer self deception to which you subconsciously subject yourself by comparing your memories which you label as your 'past' to your present. I repeat, you regard subconsciously your memories as your entire ‘past' even though your memories doesn't constitute 1/10 th part of your life, and then compare it to the present.\\nSo sort things out like how he did. By speaking truth by being truthful to your guy and yourself. Then you will get yourself back with less pain and mess. But instead of sorting out, out of your tension if you demand same emotion from him in the name of whatever it is between you, you will make mess. I repeat it is mess. It isn't solution to sort your problem that you are seeking if you are aiming at mess. And if you are aiming at mess, good luck with that because that doesn't work.\\nHaving said all that I would like to advice you not to become hopeless or anti-love or anti-men. It isn't because he hates you he said that. It is because he noticed, I repeat, it is because he 'noticed' that he isn't being truthful to you he said that.\\nSo, all that happens depends on you. Choose a way less painful. Put a proposition that satisfies you both. Then slowly get out of touch if you can. Choose a way less painful. Good luck.\", 'date': 'Apr 12, 2020', 'user_name': 'Abhinay', 'view': 25, 'upvote': 0}, 1: {'answer': 'I don’t think it’s unhealthy to ask certain questions about relationships.

I’ve gotten to know a few Pisces folk and one pattern I’ve noticed is that when it comes sexuality and attraction, they’re pretty open and fluid. Meaning there’s a good chance they won’t be straight, especially Pisces women.\\nMy best friend is a Pisces and I feel like I know her pretty well. When we first met, it was very obvious there was a mutual attraction. But once we actually started talking is what made it deeper. We talked about spirituality, the universe, astrology, suicide, depression, the weird and fucked up circumstance in which our parents met, we were just open and vulnerable.\\nNow, I also wanna make it clear she didn’t fall in love with me. We got to the point where there was heavy sexual tension, but it wasn’t acted on because she had a boyfriend. Not gonna lie though, this is what brought on my first moral crisis.\\nIf you wanna get a Pisces woman to fall in love with you, learn her. Learn her love language, learn what makes her feel seen, learn what it means to her to be sensual because you’re definitely gonna need in your back pocket. Pisces is a highly sensitive water sign. Sensuality runs through the blood of us water signs. This likely means you’ll be giving plenty of kisses and cuddles and massages and back rubs.\\nOh, I should also probably mention that you should learn how to be physically intimate without the expectation of sex. I don’t know if that’s how it is for most water signs, but so far, that’s the way it’s been with the water signs I’ve met and myself included. Giving her a massage or foot rub while she tells you about her day, running your fingers through her hair as you guys watch TV together, stopping on the way home and getting her favorite candy or book just because. Shit like that is what you gotta do, but it has to be authentic. You gotta do it because you actually want to, not because you’ve got some ulterior motive other than seeing her light up. If it’s not coming from the heart, it will be felt and you absolutely will be kicked to the curb.', 'date': 'Apr 15, 2020', 'user_name': 'Gabe Beesley', 'view': 46, 'upvote': 0}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

Nobody will ever love anyone unconditionally, otherwise everyone would find love. You have to be smart, funny, handsome, healthy, fun, rich, good with kids, good with people, good, good, good. And if you fail to meet those expectations, it's time to move on. Everyone wants the best possible partner and given the opportunity for someone “better”, most people will take it. And you're not the only one. It happens to many people. I bet some of your friends have gone through the same thing.

For my own relationship, I was never discarded and was in fact the one who broke up with them and went “no contact” which is essentially a discard. I have firm control over my feelings and behavior and I’m not susceptible to hoovering, so my ex became incredibly abusive and frustrated. He stalked me, messed with my emails to and from clients, and continues to smear me to our colleagues, this is a year and a half later. I still haven’t recovered from this.\\nAlthough there was never a time I expressly accepted the relationship as a relationship, I was pressured into telling people we were dating, that started maybe a year before I went no contact, and I was living across the country at the time. So if you consider it a real consensual relationship, that was only a year.\\nI’ve heard that that kind of abuse can go one for 40+ years. I imagine if you’ve been with the person a while, or if you’re the one to do the leaving, it can really hurt the person.\\nTo be super clear, I absolutely don’t regret leaving and even though I’m bothered by it, I’m so very much healthier than I was when he was in my life. It is very difficult and the path out is armed but it’s the only way to get your life back. You also need to tell close family what you’ve been going through, in detail, with proof, so that when the breakup comes and the smear campaign begins, you’ll have people on your side.\\nBest of luck.', 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020', 'user_name': 'Michelle Philomela', 'view': 124, 'upvote': 1}}, 'topic_list': ['Malignant Narcissism', 'Obsession', 'Narcissists', 'Breaking Up', 'Narcissistic Personality Disorder', 'Narcissism', 'Love', 'Dating Advice', 'Dating and Relationships', 'Human Behavior']}\n",

The only difference is that they don’t ‘fall in love’ in the normal way.\\nAromantics are definitely not incapable of love.

It’s very essential to understand exactly why your partner is depressed. That does not mean you need to unnecessarily coax them to talk to you about it, you just need to look out for the right signals. They will talk or make small hints that they want to. It’s imperative for you to listen to them whole-heartedly, please remember, they do not need your opinion. You could help them by not letting them be around people with negative vibes. Your common social circle may have people like that and their opinions could affect your partner. Always keep looking for the right signs, your partner may not be interested in trying something new but once in a while when they say they feel like doing something new or rebuilt something that they have lost their interests on is the time you need to get started with them, be as encouraging as possible and make them try to enjoy it with you. It’s a difficult task to be on the lookout constantly but if you keep trying, your partner will open up more to you and it will become easier. Try not to force your ideas on them, give them space, do not push them to do what they are unwilling to do however recreational it maybe and most of all, do not give up on them. They will see that in you and will appreciate you for the rest of their lives.

Dont literally watch their every move. That will only push them away and into their paranoia and delusions.\\nSecond, I believe each drug is probably different from each other.\\nThird, I can only answer for meth.\\nHyperactivity, as meth causes a rush of energy to the person using.\\nTwitching, facial tics, jerky movements, as it goes hand in hand with the hyperactivity.\\nParanoia, the user is doing an illegal drug, after all. Of course, they'll be paranoid about getting caught.\\nDilated pupils, which is with any drug/opiod/narcotic.\\nNoticeable and sudden weight loss, as using meth takes away your appetite. As a result, you tend to stop eating and therefore will lose weight and quickly.\\nSkin sores; one of the more unfortunate side effects of meth use. Often users will get delusions/hallucinations that there are bugs crawling on the skin or just underneath its surface. As a result, they'll tend to scratch and pick at the spots, leaving sores.\\nRapid eye movement, again hand in hand with not only hyperactivity but also paranoia.\\nAgitation; when you have so much energy built up and might have paranoia slipping in, you're bound to become agitated.\\nBurns, particularly on the lips or fingers; this is if the user is smoking the crystal, whether it be from chemical burn from the ingredients or burn from the fire/heat of the glass.\\nErratic sleeping patterns; it gives the user so much energy the person might stay up 3 days or more. Furthermore, if they can't keep the meth on hand and have to go without, they'll hit “the crash” where they might sleep 3 days or more.\\nRotting teeth; and you thought cigarettes were bad!? Meth mouth, as it's called, can completely ruin your teeth. Turning them back until they eventually completely rot, causing you lose them. And, they're very painful while they rot away.\\nOutbursts or mood swings; especially if they're going through a time without meth. But, the user will become so paranoid they might lash out at the ones they love. Not because they're angry, but simply because they hate themselves for not being able to live life with the precious meth.\\nHope this helps some.

If your ex text you a few days after the break up it is crucial that you do not come off as needy or emotional as chances are they are just testing the waters. Do not say you miss them or anything like that. Say a few weeks to a month pass with no contact and you feel relatively better about your situation now would be when you can initiate a conversation.

But the main advice is, you have to disentangle yourself from this toxic person. It’s going to hurt, but it’s going to hurt a lot more if you keep her in your life.\\nFirst, the legal problems. Was the marriage legally recognized, by a marriage certificate or equivalent? The law doesn’t care if the marriage was secret or not. If you do have a legally valid marriage, you should legally divorce, because otherwise you are still entangled with this person. Depending on local laws, you might not be able to date other people without being accused of adultery, which means you might end up having to pay your ex a lot of money. So, I’d start there. If it wasn’t a legally-recognized marriage (but was recognized by the Hindu faith as being valid), then I’m not sure what you have to do, as I don’t know what the rules are concerning divorce in that faith.\\nSecond, interpersonal: basically, you should break off contact, and look for somebody else (after taking care of any legal/cultural prohibitions against seeing someone else). Getting dumped really sucks, I’ve been there. But there are other people out there. You just have to move on.\\nThird, cultural: are other people going to look down on you because you are in this situation? Here I’m not so sure what to say, because I admit I’m not really familiar with your culture. But I will say, if you think that you have an accurate analysis of the situation, trust that analysis, even if you are being pressured to see things differently. Again, hard to do, but you have to trust the fact that your family, friends, or priest will not be in possession of as many facts as you are. They won’t know what that relationship was really like. So basically, trust yourself.\\nGood luck, I’m rooting for you.', 'date': 'Jan 30, 2020', 'user_name': 'Mark Kozlowski', 'view': 102, 'upvote': 3}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

It is written in the traditional Shakespearean (or English) style of sonnet. It contains three quatrains and followed by a rhyming couplet. The couplet section is the portion that this questions is about.\\nLet\\'s walk through a brief summary of the three quatrains before we address the couplet.\\nQuatrain 1: The poem begins by addressing the beloved, whom the entire poem relates. The beloved is being compared to a summer\\'s day. Shakespeare says, \"Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,/And summer\\'s lease hath all too short a date:\" In this, he is saying that love and summer both are fleeting and can easily be shaken by \"rough winds\" that come their way.\\nQuatrain 2: Quite literally, this section says that sometimes summer (and love) are too hot and can decrease the beauty of the beloved. In the line, \"And every fair from fair sometime declines,\" discuss the changing course of the season. Quite literally, the change from summer to fall (the change of love in youth to age). He says that nature will not halt these changes.\\nQuatrain 3: \"But thy eternal summer shall not fade,\" the beauty of the beloved shall never fade, like the real summer does. In the eye of the speaker, the beloved shall always be beautiful and lovely. And, the beloved shall never find death or lines of age.\\nShakespeare sums up the sonnet, in the rhyming couplet, by saying that his love will exist for as long as humanity exists, and that while his love will be universal through time, it will also be the perpetuating force that drives humanity. Considering that, as we know it, the concept of love has been around since the inception of humanity, the logical progression that it will thrive throughout humanity is not that far of a stretch. The flattering motion produced by Shakespeare isn’t really that love is immortal, but rather that his love for this one person will be immortal, and the springboard for love to come.', 'date': 'Apr 16, 2020', 'user_name': 'Newsha Sensel', 'view': 51, 'upvote': 3}}, 'topic_list': ['Love Poems', 'English Poetry', 'Poetry Analysis', 'Poems', 'Poetry', 'Literature', 'Love']}\n",

The moment you break someone up from a partner they truly care for is the moment your crush becomes a obsession. That being said, you should never wish for a relationship to end but if it does you could try. My advice is wait at first. After getting out a relationship she almost certainly doesn’t want to immediately go back into one. This process varies from person to person. It could takes weeks for one person and years for another. But what you can do is provide emotional support in a truly friendly way where you care for her emotional repairing and well being. After she seems like she’s ready for a relationship I’d say just ask. She likely has a deep connection to you and at the very least has a why not mentality to this. From this point on it purely varies. But there is some advice I would consider universal. DO NOT force her to do something she doesn’t want to do. That goes for any person ever.

Let me be perfectly franc about this answer. You simply don’t love anyone you have just met and telling them so is a lie! After 6 months it is still a lie! After a year it is still a complete lie! Love is something that takes time and trust and knowing someone thru and thru, right down to the bone. So, what you are confessing is nothing more than hormones my dear. Being horny! Or at least if you are truly sincere, liking someone. After five years, looking someone in the eyes after making love and you know you know that person and you tell them from the bottom of your very being “I love you”, then maybe you are getting a little closer to actually being honest about it! Don’t be a desperate little girl, who gives your love to the next best thing over and over, like it is the cheapest thing you can give.

It could be he has a mood disorder or that he has developed what some psychologists’/therapists’ relationship self-help books refer to as “contempt” on the part of one person or both within a relationship. Overtime, as a relationship evolves, sometimes someone develops resentment or contempt towards the other which can appear as hatred. It's possible on the days he seems loving he wants something, and then the other days come and you see how he really feels. I don't want to paint negativity since it could be anything, maybe just a misunderstanding. But perhaps you have tendencies that are not apparent to you that aggravate him. No one on Quora can tell you for sure. I don't think you can tell until you consult a counselor for advice. That way you can get to the bottom of what is happening. Things should be clear with the insight of a therapist or psychologist. Sometimes attraction brings people into a relationship, but after the novelty wears off people realize they don't really like the character or personality of the other person. But they often stay on because they're attached or getting sometime from it that they want. Just be careful that you're in a good relationship. You deserve mutual love, respect and commitment.

I suggest that you keep doing it, especially since it wasn’t painful and you didn’t hate it.

Personally, anal feels much better than vaginal for me and gives me the best orgasms, but I didn’t learn how to orgasm from it on its own right away, it took practice. Though even anal combined with a clit orgasm feels more intense than anything vaginal for me.\\nIf you get sore or need to stop because it starts to get too much, that’s another reason to do it more often and practice, and pretty quickly (especially if it didn’t hurt you the first time you tried it) you’ll find it a lot easier to keep going without needing to stop.\\nAs with all things, practice makes perfect!', 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020', 'user_name': 'Alana Brown', 'view': 96, 'upvote': 3}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

Wait for what? Are there really hordes of people out there, sitting around, biding their time, with plans to “get with” someone but choosing not to until something else happens first?\\n“I really want to get with Dave, but first I have to complete my first novel, and then I’ll be ready to get with them.” I mean, I suppose if someone is really just to busy to date, they might want to wait until they have more free time. And, of course, I would very likely wait to go on a real, in-person date with someone until after the second wave that will come after the quarantines are all lifted too early. But waiting to be in person with someone doesn’t mean that the relationship can’t go ahead and start.\\nAs soon as I recognize that I have romantic feelings for a person, I mention it to them. Then, if they feel the same, we start a relationship. If they don’t, then we don’t. What would I wait for? Their mother’s blessing? A sign from a magic sky daddy? The moon rising in Sagittarius during a lunar eclipse? To what purpose?\\nIf I had to say that I waited for anything, it would be for their consent. Without their consent, a relationship doesn’t happen. But if I don’t have their consent, I don’t really “wait” for it, in the sense of them saying no and me pretending to be their friend while scheming to make them love me.

I just don’t *do* anything to them without getting their consent first.\\nSo, I might wait a few moments between “I really like you, may I kiss you?” and actually kissing them, depending on how long it takes them to give me an answer one way or the other.

A few days ago when she cancelled on me I said “why Everytime we have are going to call you have 5.3 Million things to do, I can fly to space or just off a bridge and watch my legs heal then maybe you’d actually spend some time with me.” I did not mean this literally whatsoever. But she told me I was manipulative, and that I threatened her.

To truly L.O.V.E. is a very selfless act.\\nBut it has changed over a period of time.\\nInitially , let\\'s call it the honeymoon period. Love is in the air. Everything just seems so romantic. You and your partner are all lovey dovey.\\nThen comes the 2nd phase. When you\\'re discovering one another\\'s annoying habits and you both quarrel with one another alot. But later you make up if you are really in love and if not then you both part your ways.\\nAssuming that you both are still together you enter the transitional phase. Here you\\'re both comprehending of what is happening to one another. For instance, guy starts taking the girl for granted..Girl might get attracted to someone who is paying attention to her in this vulnerable moment and further it might lead to something we do not want but it is bound to happen. Vice versa\\nEither both of you are super loyal and don\\'t pay attention to anyone and work on your relationship instead of looking around. OR\\nOne of you isn\\'t emotionally available and thus leading your significant other to cheat on you (I do not justify this act, but trying to understand the mindset)\\nYou are building one another\\'s trust by reassuring each other. By saying “That the guy I hangout with is just a friend. Nobody could ever be you or take your place\". You both are vigorously trying to save your relationship because insecurity is a common trait found in our generation thanks to the easy access to social media.. so ppl can easily cheat.\\nYou both work on your ambitions and goal and try to move in together or trying to live in same city(presuming that you\\'re in LDR)because this phase would come after a year probably but few may be quick to take such steps.\\nYou both are comfortable in each other\\'s silence. You guys function and quarre like a married couple\\nYou both introduce each other to your respective families and try your best to make them like your counterpart.

If we can look at it from this perspective then we can make our world more peaceful!\\nLooking inside, return to innate nature and enrich our hearts are the message to talk to people.\\nFirst, we actually, cannot blame this pandemic caused by COVID-19 to all Chinese people. Everyone has a contribution to today's situation so that no one should blame each other. Things happen as human morality is sliding on the big slope. Nowadays, some people are not only bent solely on profit, but they even stop at no evil. They will do all kinds of evil things for money, and they will also commit murder, pay someone to kill, and abuse drugs. Human moral is sliding down but some of us have not realized that and even see some of them as normal. Back to traditional is the way to improve human morality.\\nSecond, why did the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) destroy 5000 years of ancient Chinese Culture? The ancient Chinese culture has spiritual practices such as Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism. But why this CCP destroy all of them? It is because of control. They cannot control people with strong faith. They cannot force good people to do bad things. Therefore, they have to suppress the good things to ease of doing so many evil things; massacre of social elites at the Cultural Revolution, massacre in Tiananmen Square, Persecution of prisoners of conscience – especially, Falun Gong practitioners – Forced into Organ Harvesting. Some of us know their evil things but one eye close, one eye open to going together with CCP. Why? We all talk about freedom and embrace freedom here in the West but why we still work with them, still give them the stage to perform and to grow. It is also because of the immediate benefits.\\nLast but not least, there so many lessons in the past such as the fall of the Roman Empire and the killing of all firstborn sons in Egypt. Why were these two powerful empires collapsed? Is this because of suppressing religious believers?\\nCOVID-19 Pandemic is part of the divine plan to help human beings repay karmic debts and destroy CCP. To be saved, we should repent to the divine with all due sincerity, admits to our faults and pray for a chance to change our way and stay away from CCP.

A couple of thoughts/suggestions for you:\\nRespect his wishes. I see other people saying he needs to respect your decisions, but I don’t see anything in your question that tells me he doesn’t. He just doesn’t want to get hurt. Don’t bring anyone to meet him until you feel you have something solid going on.\\nExplain to him that he’s missing out on the chance to meet the people who are important to you, and that you’d rather know how well he’ll get along with them before you make the decision that anyone is the right one to marry. Perhaps he’ll consider that.\\nNow, if he thought of your ex sort of like a son, if it’s not a problem for you, you might consider encouraging him to continue having a relationship with him. Just because the guy is no longer in your life, doesn’t mean he can’t be in your father’s—unless, like I said, it’s a problem for you. If they go fishing or something, that’s not a bad thing, but if you encourage that, you may also want to explain that you don’t want the ex around you. Communication is key.\\nEncourage your dad to get out more (when it’s safe again to do so) and make friends, take up a hobby or several, and generally have a life of his own. If he feels the need to be a father figure to young men, there are many opportunities in community service that might help him to not get so attached to any one particular person you bring to meet him. It can be hard for older men to bond with guys their own age if they’re starting out as total strangers. But there are a lot of younger guys who lack a father in their lives, and if he has anything to teach/pass on, it could be a great benefit for him to go out there and try.

Never look through the lens of normal thinking people whatever the narcissists do or think. They have distorted view on reality. Because they have been lying all their life, they can not recognize truth anymore. Everything is viewed through a distorted lens, through a twisted view on reality. Their mental processing is not like that of normal emotionally healthy people. This is why they hurt people. Their interpretation, perception of whatever is happening in a relationship is screwed.. It’s tough cause the person who you thought was real dosen’t exist. Almost like death. Just keep within yourself that it is NOT your fault. These people make me sick. They cheat, lie, steal, and worst of all, twists the stories up to make you the victim.\\nWe are good hearted people we don’t deserve this, one thing we must constantly keep in mind is that we always have to remember to love ourselves first.\\nHope this helps.

My guess is that you have come to see romantic attachments as a hindrance, because you have had disappointing encounters in the past, most likely in childhood.\\nThe problem is, you have needs that are going to be expressed in some manner. If you deny your need for emotional support, you will sabotage your business relationships by making inappropriate demands on your business associates. If you deny your need for healthy physical interaction, you might become addicted to pornography, or even to some kind of behavior that can get you into trouble. A need that you try to ignore does not just go away.\\nIf your parents were alcoholics, you might want to look into organizations that deal with that. If not, you might not qualify for membership in that particular club, but you will likely find another where you can belong. The important thing is to find a support group of some kind.\\nPeople like to talk about the need for openness, but there are situations where too much openness can be counter productive. For instance, if a previous employer was constantly belittling you, that isn’t something you should bring up in a job interview, though it might be worth mentioning to an employment counselor.

He sought to bring people together to ponder philosophy, ethics, culture, history, literature, religion (he was also a minister).\\nThe group had already met a few times before. This time, they planned to meet in the evening at The Atomic Cafe. When I got to the door at 6 pm, it was closed shut. The January night was bitter cold. The streets were empty. I must have made a mistake as to the date or time.\\nI had printed out and read the assignment, Civil Disobedience by Henry David Thoreau and Letter from Birmingham by Rev. Martin Luther King. Read and compare.\\nThis was my entry point into a new life beyond the grief zone I’d inhabited for two years after losing my husband. I decided to reclaim my interest in the vestiges of my long ago liberal arts education, the part of me I thought had disappeared in my lawyering life. My resolution meant a lot to me, a sign that I was ready to construct some kind of life for myself.\\nI felt shot down on my first attempt to enter into the world outside of my safety zone. I had let myself get excited about a new beginning. How naive was I, thinking that my life could change in the mere act of joining a group? And that anyone cared?\\nI was about to leave when someone came up to the door and asked, “Are you here for the meeting? We moved it to the Indo Bar down the street.”\\nI found a seat in the group of eight at a table in an alcove. The professor opened the meeting that went on for two hours. Yes, the place was noisy and lively, not anything like the coffee house atmosphere I signed up for. Even so, I felt a part of something familiar in the back and forth banter of ideas between people of good will.\\nBefore the meeting broke up, the leader finally asked, almost as an aside, for introductions. I had prepared mine ahead of time, “My name is Barrie. I lost my husband of forty-one years exactly two years ago. I decided on a goal for myself, to look for all that is life-affirming from now on. Joining your group is part of my plan.”\\nThe gentleman across the table introduced himself next, David, a psychotherapist, writer, and photographer.

You’ve been with yourself throughout your lifetime you cannot let a span of three months deteriorate your mental/physical/emotional health.

What matters is that we don’t loose ourselves in the process of making things work.\\nHobby - Develop hobbies,try mediating/yoga/lifting, start writing whatever you are feeling,be a better person not for anybody but for yourself.\\nGratitude - Start thanking God for everything you have rather than cribbing about things you don’t got. Text your friends who keep a check on you, be friendly full of live. You attract what you are,so be a beautiful,thankful soul.\\nAnd about not eating and crying, All I can say is no one will value you until you value yourself. How can you expect any other person to love you,when you can’t even love yourself? Start by eating small meals,breakups can be tough,but i believe that you are tougher and capable enough to go through all this,try watching movies/series, distract yourself completely, do things for yourself, love yourself, because you deserve all the happiness of the entire world. ;)\\nThis too,will pass.\\nYou’ll be okay.

It takes two to tango. I’m just saying I wouldn’t involve myself with someone who is married or in a relationship serious or not, but that’s my view on it. It shows what kind of person the person is and how low or not so good their morale is. If their morale proves to be good enough for you, and she has a “good” reason, proceed at your own risk. She should definitely leave the other guy if she wants you as a serious person though if she likes you enough. Plus who’s to know if she’s trying to use you to make her main jealous?

You have to work on yourself, not change boyfriends — in principle, I don’t know you or your boyfriend, so this is in general.\\nYou have to work on the closeness and create it all the time. By work I mean find ways and plan out and actively implement. You have to create subjects to talk about and things to do together, you have to search for and find points of agreement and expound on those, you have to sort out points of disagreement to turn them into agreement, you have to weed out all the points of compromise and make them into pure agreement, you have to change your attitude from “what can he do for me” to “how can I be a better girlfriend.” I am not kidding. The divorce rate is 45% and cheating rate is about 2/3. Things are not going well for most people, do something else, be responsible.\\nThe point of compromise may need clarification. The definition of compromise is when both are miserable. Compromise is bad. So if he, for example, wants to stay home and watch a football game and you want to go to the beach, but as a compromise you decided to go to the movies, neither gets what they wanted and both are disappointed. This is the opposite of where you need to be heading. Or if he went to the beach with you as a compromise but was upset about not being able to watch the game on TV and ruined his own and your day by constant bickering, you are both disappointed. Or if you compromised by staying home with him watching the game through long bouts of bitchiness, then again you are both disappointed. Compromises do not work. Here is what works: you sort out through communication how badly he wants that game and if he can record it on DVR and what going to the beach means to you and then either you decide that you WANT to stay and watch that game and be happy together and make it a great day to remember or he decides that he WANTS to go to the beach with you and make it a great day for both of you.

I used to talk to a guy. I literally met him at a tattoo shop, he was the piercer. I saw him, he was attractive in the way he asked questions. He seemed very caring which was attractive to me. So I decided I’d give it a shot.\\nThat night I am not kidding you, he sent me a very long paragraph through text saying how much I wowed him and how he had fallen for every word that I said and how I was so enticing to him. Cool that was nice of him to be so thoughtful and caring.\\nFew days later we go on a date. He’s keeping eye contact. The flow of the conversation just doesn’t stop at all. It was a nice date. That night he text me an even longer paragraph at how he’s positive I’m the one for him. That we need to get married and have a baby ASAP. That he is completely in love with me. So this here gives me a weird vibe already. How can you be in love with me when you barely know me?\\nSo one more shot. We go on another date and I told him I’m not completely ready for a relationship I’d just like to slow down and that I know he doesn’t love me, that we can continue talking and see where it goes. I go home and he texts me immediately a paragraph that his heart has shattered to pieces and why was I telling him I didn’t love him etc. I reassured him that I was only saying that I know he doesn’t love me and that it takes time to fall in love with someone and we will take that time if it works that way. He then starts to tell me that he’s dying of cancer and he’s not sure how long he will live. That it’s 6 months tops that we need to be in a relationship so that he can die happy with the woman he loves. I told him that I’d care about him and be there to talk to him but I was not going to get into a relationship when I’m not sure of how to even love myself yet. I’d just been recovering from 4 years of severe depression and a 2nd attempted suicide not too long before talking to him. I was not ready for a relationship AT ALL. Especially with someone that was throwing immediately red flags.\\nAnyways the point is, more often than not a confession of love with weeks of meeting someone is certainly a red flag to a healthy minded woman. I’ve rushed into tens of relationships that never worked because why? We did not take the time to fully get to know each other. I will tell everyone that asks me about loving their partner, It takes time. You can love the thought of being with someone as much as you want, but there is no way that you can fall in love with another human being without fully knowing everything that they’re capable of.', 'date': 'Apr 10, 2020', 'user_name': 'Jennifer Lopes', 'view': 139, 'upvote': 1}, 1: {'answer': \"It's very complicated and given that you just met them, I would say it's not the best option to do but you know life is all about taking risks.

It was very emotional and there’s was crying on both sides but we both reiterated that we still love and care deeply for each other and how important we are in each other’s life’s. He broke up with me saying that it was because he needs to do this in order to move forward and find out who he is and because he doesn’t want to hurt me anymore (even though I told him I never felt that he did). I feel like we had something special and our love was authentic. I also feel that this was partially my fault because I would make a big deal out of little things and because I had some trust issues from the past I told him about. This break up has been a real eye opener to me about how I acted inappropriately sometimes and I genuinely want to change myself for the better. After a long emotional talk about the break up we decided to end the bad day on a good note and we drove to get smoothies. He held my hand tight the whole time and took the long way back to my place. We gave each other one long last goodbye hug and a last kiss. We both cried and he assured me everything was going to be ok. I told him I know it’s not certain, but I like there’s a possibility of us getting back together one day and he agreed. We said we love each other and he told me that we don’t have to say goodbye, just I’ll see you next time. It was heartbreaking watching him leave but I haven’t talked to him since that and he hasn’t contacted me. I know it was only yesterday, but is there any possibility we could get back together and work this out? I want to become a better person and I know this is going to take time but I really do love him and genuinely believe he feels the same way, we just need some time to get better and more mature.', 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020', 'user_name': 'Katheryn Baeza', 'view': 558, 'upvote': 1}, 1: {'answer': 'Well how can you rekindle a relationship if there is no contact?

So, I don’t really believe in the stuff that I haven’t personally experienced or had a ton of proof for. Same was with the whole meant to be and soulmates stuff. I have always believed that for anything to work out in your favour you have to work extremely hard at it and consistently. Fate has nothing to do with it and it’s just an excuse lazy people make to not work stuff out. Even though 90% of this belief is very sustained today, I do believe now, that fate also has a role to play.\\nHere’s a little background.\\nIt’s November of 1988. I’m in the final leg of completing my Bachelors in Arts and I was a great student. Both my parents were professors of literature and it was a very obvious thing that they imbibed their love for literature in me and well. I too wanted to be a professor and my parents made me go to college in my vacation days with them so as to understand the work schedule and environment there. It was a mini internship, of sorts. This is where I met a shy man, a year elder to me and we bonded over our love for literature and how education is the only thing in the world that change the society we live in.\\nSoon, friendship transformed into love and before we knew it we had promised each other that we would be married to each other. Two blissful years passed like this. But here there was a big hitch. I am Hindu and he was a Christian. Even though intercaste and inter-religion marriages are frowned upon today, we see a pleasant change when it comes to the acceptance of these marriages. But back in 1990, it was a huge taboo. Just like “You-Know-The-One-Thing-That-Should-Not-Be-Talked_About”. My parents knew my boyfriend really well and liked him but they too had reservations but they eventually came around. I was so happy as 50% of the hurdle was passed. I was waiting for my boyfriend to tell him this wonderful news (Mobile phones were a luxury), but he never turned up. I couldn’t contact him for 2 days and I started fearing the worst. After two days, his neighbour came to my house with a letter from my boyfriend in which he had written that he was moving to Delhi permanently for job and that his family had fixed his marriage with someone from his church. I hadn't felt that much anger and devastation in my whole entire life. He had abandoned me and didn’t even have the courage to face me.\\nI was taunted by everyone: family, friends, colleagues and neighbours for loving someone from a different religion. I became the biggest joke and gossip. But through and through, my parents and my sister were my biggest support and honestly, they were the only people who helped me get over the overwhelming pain and hurt I was feeling. I had an amazing opportunity to work in Kolkata at that point, and my father in a heartbeat agreed to let me pursue it. This decision was again looked down upon as working women were considered a joke but a woman working away from home was a whole ball game altogether.\\nBut my dad stood my decision and I went off to Kolkata. Three years passed and I was 25 years old and then came the dooming question of my marriage. It was a huge deal and my parents were really worried. Still, they didn’t put any type of pressure on me and let me be. Around this time, I received the news that my ex-boyfriend had married and had moved on and this again opened some wounds which I thought were closed. For me, this was the final straw and although I was really wary of relationships and marriage in general, I couldn’t see my parents suffering and being the mole of all the taunts from the society after everything they had done for me in the past 3 years. To have that incredible support was my biggest blessing because usually in cases like mine, the girl is either labelled characterless and disowned by her own family.\\nI went to my father and said to him that I was ready to get married only if I was “allowed” to work. Things moved pretty fast after this and I was married within a year. My husband was a really nice man. He was kind and gentle and he knew everything about my history and never made it a case against me. We had a daughter within the next year and just like that five years of marriage just passed by. From the outside, I had the most perfect life. Good job, good married life and good health but I always felt something was missing\\nOne day I was going through some of my old stuff and I found a photo of me and ex-boyfriend with a single stem of marigold. And it happened so suddenly. All the memories came rushing back and I knew in that very second what was missing. I was never in love with my husband and he was at the least only a friend. And I had never stopped loving my ex-boyfriend.\\nI became more and more miserable with each passing day and I think my husband started noticing. One fine day he asked me what was wrong and I broke down completely and told him all the truth. It shattered him but nonetheless he said that if I wasn’t happy in the marriage, I shouldn’t be in it. We applied for mutual divorce and again it created a huge controversy. But my family and my ex-husband became my biggest support.\\nWe figured out a way to co-parent and had joint custody of our daughter. This was the year 1999 and divorces were a long and messy affair. I came back to stay at my parents' house for a few days. One evening I decided to take a walk down the street and ended up at a place which was a favourite of mine and my ex-boyfriend and voila! I see him sitting there, in our favourite spot, eating our all-time favourite order. Anger that was bottled up within me for the past one decade overcame me and I went to confront him. When I approached him, he was taken aback and just sat through all the screaming I did at him. Once I was finally done, told me everything that had happened. His family had threatened him that if he didn’t let go of me they would defame and also disown him. That is why he took the overnight decision to move to Delhi to live with his cousin so as to protect me and the reason he sent the letter through his neighbour was that he was the only one he could trust at that point of time. I told him that I didn’t believe him at all and he said that was fair. But what he said next blew my mind. He told me that he thought he was over me and that he was happy in his new life until he saw the same photo I had seen which made him realise he still loved me and I was taken aback. It also happened around the same time too. Soon after, he divorced his wife and he had come back to Mumbai. After this point on, there was no looking back.\\nWe picked up from where we had left off and everything slowly started falling in place. We got married in 2001 and had a son a year later. Recently, my daughter got married and she had her two dads walk her down the aisle.\\nWe were just meant to be and honestly, this is a magic work of fate :)\\nIf you are here till the end, thank you!\\nLeave a comment below if you liked my story and if it made you believe in your story too!\\nLove,\\nA.G\", 'date': 'Apr 13, 2020', 'user_name': 'Anonymous', 'view': 7, 'upvote': 1}}, 'topic_list': ['Love Stories', 'Stories', 'Love', 'Survey Question']}\n",

He very rarely shows his anger. I never take this as an advantage. I apologise to him if I am wrong. I don't hesitate to accept my mistakes.\\nHe appreciates my efforts, my cooking, my duties, I take towards his parents and our house.\\nHe is extremely modest. Also, likes to live a simple life.\\nHe sends a text when he misses me, perhaps a simple love/like the kind of message. Every marriage has up's and down's, we too had and sometimes misunderstandings do arise.\\nNever for once in 5 years of marital life, we have exchanged dirty pics and have had sex conversations or I had been forced for it.\\nHe says I was his and am the best friend forever.\\nHe works very hard for the family, sometimes, late nights, sometimes, 2 days at a stretch, his work keeps him very busy. He always thanks me for not nagging and disturbing him. Space is important for a good relationship.\\nHe stands for me when I have to juggle between inlaws and myself. At least, he thinks who is correct and who's not. (He has his brain and not a kid). If he wouldn't have supported, it was difficult for me to stay in this marriage for 5 years. For a happy marriage, the ere aren't just a husband and the wife but the husband and his entire family. You're not happy even if one of his family members is not good. Now, don't ask me, ‘why do you bother about others'? And, yes, I must bother because marriage is just not 2.\\nHe can't see my tears. He can't see me in pain.\\nHe asks me to rest as much as possible when is off from work and does all the household. It's difficult for me sometimes to manage during 6-the month pregnancy.\\nHe can never stop me thanking! For the understanding I have towards him, the responsibilities, I take, for the woman I am, for the brain and mind I have, for the thinking I have as same as him, for not pressurizing him to buy a house or any huge investment. I know he earns well but I do not want a house by taking hefty EMI's, instead, I want to save money. I don't believe in the concept of paying instalments and interests that's isn't affordable for me, at least. For instance, we own a house but life changed so much due to Corona, I do not have savings, what would we do? What would we eat? How would we pay the bills? How would he manage his parents? They are dependent on him for everything! I must think all these………. It's not easy for a middle-class family to buy a house and suffer in tougher times. Can't predict life.\\nHe respects me and my parents. He never taunts anyone not speaks of others beit his friends or anyone. He has a good nature.\\nHe has never for once complained against me to his parents. Initially, it was very difficult adjusting to the conservative and reserved family of his. My MIL is a tough person to handle.\\nHe accepts the differences we have. I am stubborn.\\nHe will never have an affair outside me, at least for this life I am his. He will and want to find some other in the next, he says \\U0001f923😀\\U0001f92a\\nSo, you know how sweet he is!\\nThe sweetness of a person is not measured by the trophies they gift but by the gestures that fill one's heart.\", 'date': 'Apr 14, 2020', 'user_name': 'Sravanthi', 'view': 791, 'upvote': 26}, 1: {'answer': 'I got married a year and half back.

By the time my dad died the day after Thanksgiving in 2000, I had just about heard it all. Really, I thought calling someone a “son of a bitch” was an expression of affection. (You mean it’s not?)\\nAround Father’s Day the following year, by sister had sent me a letter that showed me she was prepared to take my parents’ place as my chief tormentor, as she dumped bucket loads of venom, most of which turned out to be carbon copies of everything my mother and father had told me over the years. To say it hurt like hell is an understatement.\\nThis is from the sister who for years claimed she had a Master’s Degree from (first) Berkeley, (second) USF. In economics, no less. With no evidence. (The lack of evidence might be due to the fact she’d never set foot in classrooms in either school.)\\nSo, I was standing in the kitchen, trying to keep from breaking down as I read this. My wife, Peggy, walked in, read what my sister had written, and snatched the letter away and threw it out.\\nI had already been cutting contact with my family, slowly but surely, primarily due to how they’d treated Peggy over the years. I knew for a fact my wonderful wife deserved far better than this, and I had started a good five years earlier to reject their abuse directed towards her. This was the final straw, and we severed our connections even further. At that point, we were done.\\nNo one needs this kind of abuse. No one. If your family is abusing you, and they’re telling you it’s for your own good, scratch that and move on. It’s one thing to confront you when you’re doing something destructive to your family. It’s another when they’re simply trying to break you down to simply keep you on your knees.\\nYou are under no obligation to love people who treat you with contempt. Instead, spend your time with the people who truly love you, who uplift you, who help to build you up. Spend time and love on the people who deserve your efforts.

You don\\'t choose who to fall in love with. Love just happens.\\n[They were an ordinary pair caught in an ordinary world where convention means more than a meeting of souls]\\nI\\'LL NEVER FORGET YOU\\nby Ray Bradbury\\nFrom Mar 1983 Reader\\'s Digest (Pages 92-96)\\nWhen Ann Taylor came to teach at Green Town Central, it was the summer of her 24th birthday and it was the summer when Bob Spaulding would turn 14. She was that teacher for whom all the children wanted to bring huge oranges or pink flowers. She always seemed to be passing by on days when the shade was green under then tunnels of oaks and elms. She was the fine peaches of summer in the snow of winter, and she was cool milk for cereal on a hot early-June morning. And those rare few days in the year when the climate was balanced as fine as a leaf between winds that blew just right, those were the days like Ann Taylor, and should have been so named on the calendar.\\nAs for Bob Spaulding he was the cousin who walked alone through town on any October evening with a pack of leaves after him like a horde of Halloween mice. Or you would see him, like a slow white fish in the tart waters of the Fox Hill Creek, baking brown - or hear his voice in those treetops where the wind entertained, dropping down hand by hand, and there would come Bob Spaulding to sit alone and look at the world.\\nThat first morning when Miss Ann Taylor entered and wrote her name on the board, the schoolroom seemed suddenly flooded with illumination, as if the roof had moved back. Bob Spaulding sat with a spitball hidden in his hand, but let it drop. After class, he brought in a bucket of water and began to wash the boards. \"What\\'s this?\" She turned to him from her desk, where she had been correcting spelling papers.\\n\"The boards are kind of dirty. I suppose I should have asked permission,\" he said, halting uneasily.\\n\"I think we can pretend you did,\" she replied, smiling, and at this smile he finished the boards in a burst of speed and pounded the erasers so furiously that the air was full of snow, it seemed.\\nThe next morning he happened by the place where she took board and room just as she was coming out to walk to school.\\n\"Well, here I am,\" he said.\\n\"And do you know,\" she said, \"I\\'m not surprised.\"\\n\"May I carry your books?\" he asked.\\n\"Why, thank you, Bob.\"\\nThey walked for a few minutes and he said nothing. She glanced over and slightly down at him and saw how at ease he was, how happy he seemed. When they reached the edge of the school ground, he said, \"I better leave you here. The other kids wouldn\\'t understand.\"\\n\"I\\'m not sure I do, either,\" said Miss Taylor.\\n\"Why, we\\'re friends,\" said Bob with a natural honesty.\\n\\'Bob--\" she started to say. \"Never mind.\" She walked away.\\nAnd there he was in class and there he was after school for the next two weeks, never speaking, quietly washing the boards while she worked, and there was the silence of the sun going down in the slow sky, and the rustle of papers and the scratch of a pen. Sometimes the silence would go on until almost five, when Miss Taylor would find Bob in the last seat, waiting.\\n\"Well, it\\'s time to go home,\" Miss Taylor would say. And he would run and fetch her hat and coat. Then they would walk across the empty yard and talk all sorts of things.\\n\"What are you going to be, Bob, when you grow up?\"\\n\"A writer,\" he said.\\n\"Oh, that\\'s big ambition.\"\\n\"I know, but I\\'m going to try,\" he told her. \"I\\'ve read a lot.\"\\nHe thought for a while and said, \"Do me a favor, Miss Taylor?\"\\n\"It all depends.\"\\n\"I walk every Saturday along the creek to Lake Michigan. There\\'re a lof of butterflies and crayfish. Maybe you\\'d like to walk too.\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid not. I\\'m going to be busy.\"\\nHe started to ask doing what, but stopped. \"I take along sandwiches and pop. I wish you\\'d come.\"\\n\"Thanks, Bob, perhaps some other time.\"\\n\"I shouldn\\'t have asked you, should I?\" he said.\\n\"You have every right to ask anything you want to,\" she said.\\nA few days later she gave him a copy of Great Expectations. He stayed up all night reading it, and they talked about it.\\nEach day Bob met Miss Taylor and many days she would start to tell him not to come anymore, but she never could.\\nHe talked with her about Dickens and Kipling and Poe, coming and going to school. But she found it impossible to call on him to recite in class. She would hesitate, then call someone else. Nor would she look at him while they were walking. But on several late afternoons as he moved his arm high on the blackboard, sponging away the arithmetic symbols, she found herself glancing over at him for seconds at a time.\\nThen one Saturday morning he was standing in the creek with his overalls rolled up to his knees, bending to catch crayfish, when he looked up and saw her.\\n\"Well, here I am,\" she said, laughing.\\n\"And do you know,\" he said, \"I\\'m not surprised.\"\\n\"Show me the crayfish and the butterflies,\" she said.\\nThey walked down to the lake and sat on the sand with a warm wind blowing softly about them, fluttering her hair and the ruffle on her blouse, and he sat a few yards back from her and they ate the ham-and-pickle sandwiches and drank the orange pop solemnly.\\n\"I didn\\'t think I would ever come on a picnic like this,\" she said.\\n\"With some kid,\" he said.\\nThey said little else during the afternoon.\\n\"This is all wrong,\" Bob said later. \"And I can\\'t figure why. Just walking along and catching butterflies and crayfish and eating sandwiches. But Mom and Dad\\'d rib me if they knew, and the kids would too. And the other teachers would laugh at you, wouldn\\'t they?\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid so. I don\\'t exactly understand how I came here at all,\" she said.\\nThat was about all there was to the meeting of Miss Ann Taylor and Bob Spaulding: two or three monarch butterflies, a copy of Dickens, a dozen crayfish, four sandwiches and two afternoon, she left early with a headache.\\nBut on Tuesday after school they were both in the silent room again - he sponging the board contentedly, and she working on her papers in peace, when suddenly the courthouse clock struck five. Its great bronze boom shuddered one\\'s body, making you seem older by the minute. Miss Taylor put down her pen.\\n\"Bob,\" she said, \"come here.\"\\n\"Yes\\'m.\" He put down the sponge.\\nShe looked at him intently for a moment until he looked away. \"Bob,\" I wonder if you know what I\\'m going to talk to you about.\"\\n\"Yes,\" he said at last. \"About us.\"\\n\"How old are you, Bob?\"\\n\"Going on fourteen.\"\\n\"Do you know how old I am?\"\\n\"Yes\\'m, I heard. Twenty-four. I\\'ll be twenty four in ten years, almost,\" he said. \"And sometimes I feel twenty-four.\"\\n\"Yes, and sometimes you almost act it.\"\\n\"Do I, really?!!\"\\n\"Now sit still. It\\'s very important that we understand what is happening. First, let\\'s admit we are the greatest friends in the world. I have never had a student like you, nor have I had as much affection for any boy I\\'ve ever known.\" He flushed at this. She went on. \"And let me speak for you - you\\'ve found me to be the nicest teacher of any you\\'ve ever known.\"\\n\"Oh, more than that,\" he said.\\n\"Perhaps more than that, but there are facts to be faced - a town and its people, and you and me. I\\'ve thought this over, Bob. Don\\'t think I\\'ve been unaware of my feelings. Under some circumstances our friendship would be odd. But you are no ordinary boy. And I know I\\'m not sick, mentally or physically, and that whatever has evolved here has been a true regard for your character and goodness. But those are not the things we consider in this world, unless they occur in a man of a certain age. I don\\'t know if I\\'m saying this right.\"\\n\"If I was ten years older and about fifteen inches taller it\\'d make all the difference,\" he said.\\n\"I know it seems foolish,\" she said. \"When you feel very grown-up and right and have nothing to be ashamed of. Maybe someday they will judge a person\\'s mind so accurately that they can say, \\'This is a man, though his body is only thirteen, with a man\\'s responsibility.\\' But until then, we have to go by ages and heights in an ordinary world.\"\\n\"I don\\'t like that,\" he said.\\n\"Perhaps I don\\'t either, but there really is no way to do anything about us.\"\\n\"Yes, I know.\"\\n\"We must decide what to do,\" she said. \"I can secure a transfer from this school ...\"\\n\"You don\\'t have to do that,\" he said. \"We\\'re moving. My folks and I, we\\'re going to live in Madison.\"\\n\"It has nothing to do with all this, has it?\"\\n\"No, no, my father has a new job there. It\\'s only fifty miles away. I can see you, can\\'t I?\"\\n\"Would that be a good idea?\"\\n\"No, I guess not,\" he said.\\nThey sat awhile in the silent schoolroom.\\n\"When did all this happen?\" he said, helplessly.\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" she said. \"Nobody ever knows. They haven\\'t known for thousand of years. Sometimes two people like each other who shouldn\\'t. I can\\'t explain it.\"\\n\"There\\'s one thing I want you to remember,\" she said finally. \"There are compensations in life. You don\\'t feel well now; neither do I. But something will happen to fix that. Do you believe that?\"\\n\"I\\'d like to. If only you\\'d wait for me,\" he blurted.\\n\"Ten years?\"\\n\"I\\'d be twenty-four then.\"\\n\"But I\\'d be thirty-four and another person entirely, perhaps. No, I don\\'t think it can be done.\"\\nHe sat there for a long time. \"I\\'ll never forget you,\" he said.\\n\"You\\'ll forget.\"\\n\"I\\'ll find a way of never forgetting you,\" he said.\\nShe went to erase the boards.\\n\"I\\'ll help you,\" he said.\\n\"No, no,\" she said hastily. \"You go home.\"\\nHe left the school. Looking back, he saw Miss Taylor through the window, at the board, slowly washing out the chalked words.\\nHE moved away the next week and was gone for 16 years. Though he was only 50 miles away, he never got to Green Town again until he was almost 30 and married. Then one spring they were driving through on their way to Chicago and stopped off for a day.\\nBob left his wife at the hotel and walked around town and finally asked about Miss Ann Taylor.\\n\"Oh, yes, the pretty teacher. She died in 1936, not long after you left.\"\\nHad she ever married?\\n\"No, come to think of it, she never had.\"\\nHe walked out to the cemetery and found her stone, which said, \"Ann Taylor, born 1910, died 1936.\" And he thought, Twenty-six years old. Why, I\\'m almost four years older than you are now, Miss Taylor.\"\\nLater in the day the people in the town saw Bob Spaulding\\'s wife strolling to meet him under the elms and the oak trees. She was the fine peaches of summer in the snow winter, and she was cool milk for cereal on a hot early-summer morning. And this was one of those rare few days in time when the climate was balanced like a leaf between winds that blow just right, one of those days that should have been named, everyone agreed, after Robert Spaulding\\'s wife.\"\\n- Condensed from \"A Story of Love\", a short story by Ray Bradbury.\\nWhat a beautiful love story indeed. Unconventional, unorthodox but precisely what love is all about - when two souls meet, transcending time, age, convention. Forbidden love? It depends on how you look at it.\\nHope you have enjoyed the story as much as I do. It tucked at my soul and opened the floodgate of emotions I had locked away for decades - it reminded me of my own Ms Ann Taylor, and yes, I will never forget them (I did have more than one Ms Ann Taylor).\\nGodspeed.\\nBest regards.

That doesn't make any sense. It had only been two days? — This is not normal behaviour unless:\\nDid you disappear for two days without telling anyone? If all of your friends and family members also hadn't heard from you in two days, then there would definitely be cause for concern; enough for someone who says they “love you” to lose sleep. Even if you haven't known him for that long.\\nIf you did NOT disappear, but rather, simply didn't call him or see him, then he shouldn't have got to the point of losing sleep. But because he did, it is you that needs to be concerned actually. But don't lose any sleep over it.\\nIn my opinion, assuming you haven't known this person for too long, and are not already in a long-term relationship, I don't believe that any guy should be THAT concerned about a girl he says he loves, after only two days of not hearing from her, so-much-so, that he can't sleep because of it.\\nThat is not love. That is obsession.\\nAnd obsession is VERY unhealthy and it's a character defect that you absolutely must be aware of and avoid at all costs.

Thanx to Doordarshan to broadcast this serial again.\\nSita never asked anything for himself. She always lived for others.\\nSita before her marriage used to do Gauri Puja for the fulfillment of her desires. Sita is seen everywhere as a symbol of blessing.\\nSita despite being the princess used to be involved in all household works including mopping and sweeping. One of the famous stories about it is One day while she was cleaning her house, she easily lifted the Vilshan Dhanush(Bow and arrow) of Lord Shiva. Her father, King Janak was shocked to see the kind of power Sita had and immediately started to prepare for her Swayamvar to choose an ideal husband for her.\\nSita as daughter had enthralled all. That is why, Sita’s mother had told Lord Rama that in the role of a daughter-in-law, her life will be full of grief. When she came to Rama’s house after marriage, she pleased everyone there as well. That's why Rama became very fond of her.\\nDuring Rajyaabhishek, Sita used to work full-time with Rama and assist in him in whatever he required.\\nSita used to do good care of her family that when it was decided about Rama’s exile, without even him uttering a word she understood his worry. She prepared him and herself for exile.\\nHappy Reading :)\", 'date': 'Apr 10, 2020', 'user_name': 'Anirudh Pratap Singh', 'view': 163, 'upvote': 3}}, 'topic_list': []}\n",

I know you’re only trying to find out truth based on what you seen and heard, and that is good. You question whetever it really is that way, and that is best approach towards learning about history and finding real history.\\nBUT PLEASE, PLEASE don’t base your knowledge of Tudor era on TV shows such as:\\nTudors, White Queen, White Princess and most of all-which is most inaccurate-Spanish Princess.\\nDon’t believe anything they say!!! (Because most of times, they got it not just wrong. But horribly wrong!)\\nThey are so full of inaccuracies, that as mere amateur who is interested in early Tudor era, it makes me want to throw up.\\nBig innacuracies and blunt madeup story lines.\\nAnd Margaret Beaufort and Jasper Tudor having any sort of intimate relationship, or feelings between one another is one of them.\\nWe have no record of them being too friendly between one another, we know that lady Margaret was probably rather happy in her second marriage(very happy actually, except of being kept away from her son, and worrying for him) and that always her son was her main priority. She also was very pious and took wows of chastity, while still married to her 3rd husband.\\nI don’t like the overall tune of painting early Tudors in bad light that these new TV shows. It more and more look as smear campaign against house Tudors!\\n(I don’t claim that they should be on accuracy of documentary, but they shouldn’t give out totally wrong informations.)\\nJust few examples of smearing campaign:\\nHenry VII forcing his bride to bed, presented as not giving single penny to Katherine of Aragon-hence her struggling(while it was actually her father who didn’t send her almost any money at all. And Henry VII at least paid for food for her and her servants, after she begged him, he didn’t let her starve. I cannot say same about her own father! Nor was she ever hostage in England.)\\nElizabeth of York-commiting incest by fucking her uncle?!\\n(She was in North of England, distance between Sheriff Hutton Castle and Bosworth is rather significant, she couldn’t just disappear for days on her own and return on her own unharmed in those times. She was more or less locked up with her mother and sisters in Sheriff Hutton castle. Not free to go where she pleased.)\\nMargaret Beaufort-ordering murder of two princes in Tower(as if she had any realistic oportunity?! To kill them? Maybe. To kill them and make bodies disappear without trace inside of Tower of London? Impossible!)\\n-her executing Dudley and Empson and unrightfully taking charge when Henry VII died(she was actually named Regent by her son in his will, and had hence rightfully ruled for few months that Henry VIII was underage. She died just few days after Henry VIII’s coronation, and only then Duley and Empson were imprisoned by her grandson and executed year after she died. Really Spanish Princess is worst piece of crap, that only claims to fallow history.)\\nHenry VIII-having affair with Juana of Castille? As if, from how he was devastated when Juana’s husband Phillip died, Juana was not the one Henry VIII paid any attention when those two were in England. (I don’t mean it in sexual way, young Harry was mostly isolated since his mum died, so he really craved friend and Phillip knew that being on good terms with future King of England was good for him, so he gave young boy all attention he wanted.)\\n…\\nIt doesn’t stop there. They present all of England as racist, and Spain as progressive:\\nFinest example: Katherine of Aragon’s lady in waiting in Spanish Princess-Catalina(Lina) de Cardones is played by black actress. And storyline goes that she is treated with racism in English court, while Katherine treats her as dear friend and eventually this friend is married to her love-black archer, that came with Katherine to England. (thanks to Katherine)\\nThere indeed was Catalina in Katherine’s household that came to England and had married that archer. That is true.\\nBut it was Katherine’s slave. Not her noble lady in waiting. They just had same first name, but they were not same person. Nobody ever mentions Catalina de Cardonaz as person of colour!\\nSo Katherine’s family were actually slavers, promoting slavery, promoting inquisition etc.\\nAnd all entire Spanish Princess-Spanish royals are presented as good guys, and English as bad guys, overlooking this slavery ,detail’.\\nAnd Spain presented as rich, England as very poor.\\nEtc…\\nSure, Henry VIII was in no way perfect(neither his father), and had eventually turned into tyrant we know. But this smear campaign against his family that those TV show hold, makes you really wonder if producers of those shows are not religious bigots, who continue religious propaganda on level of 16th century.\\nSurely by now we can be unbiased, distance ourself and say: both protestants and catholics have been making their leaders into saints, they overexagerated merrits, overxagerated bad deeds, they left out information that didn’t suit them and they had spread false informations. It wasn’t black and white.

Objectively examine her character. How does she deal with conflict? How does she respond to everyday problems? Does she show gratitude when you do kind things for her? Is she affirming or is she overly critical? Step back and look at who she is as a person.\\nI realize it is difficult to analyze someone when emotions are involved because those pangs of love get in the way. This is why they say “love is blind”. Obviously you are seeing some things clearly here and you are in some turmoil about it. So you are not totally blind to her faults.\\nIf you have discussed this with your girlfriend in an honest way and she is still not making any attempts at changing her behavior, then I would consider an exit strategy.\\nThing is, love needs to be nurtured. When someone is unkind, selfish, ungrateful, overbearing, critical, abusive, etc., the love starts to wither. If your girlfriend continues treating you badly, I guarantee you, the love you have for her now will not be there in a few years.\\nI would have a very direct, firm and loving conversation with her and let her know how her actions are hurting you. Perhaps she is unaware. If after you confront her she continues to take you for granted, then the onus is on you.\\nYou are the master of your ship and if you continue being mistreated, you have no one to blame but yourself. You have to have self respect. If you don’t have it for yourself, others will walk all over you.\\nA good friend once told me, “pick them for their faults because you know you can live with their virtues.”\\nAll the best to you.', 'date': 'Apr 15, 2020', 'user_name': 'Angelita Guy', 'view': 40, 'upvote': 0}}, 'topic_list': ['Love and Relationship Advice', 'Girlfriends', 'Dating and Relationship Advice', 'Love Life Advice', 'Love', 'Relationship Advice', 'Dating Advice', 'Dating and Relationships', 'Personal Question']}\n",

I live in the New Orleans area. Two sisters were on the next flight to New York. I was not contacted. He and I had become very close in the past 16 months. We were in love. He as 76 and had never married. Consequently, procrastinator that he was, he was taking his time inviting me to join him in Brooklyn. It was discussed in passing. We spoke almost daily for an hour or more at a time. If one didn’t place the call, the other would. I would nap in the evening and set my alarm for 11:05 p.m. to be awake and alert for the call. I he suffered from insomnia. I last spoke with him in the early morning hours of 3/19/201. My last words to him were good night, I love you a coupe of kisses and a “stay out of trouble” (he was Irish with a quick temper on occasion—-never with me. We never even exchanged angry words over President Trump whom I voted for and he hated with a passion.). I was had been busy and was physically tired on 3/19/2010. No call. I called him during the day on 3/20/2019. No answer. Sometimes he had problems with his iPhone. No call. On 3/21/2019 I began making calls determined to find him. No answer. I called the hospital I found him hospitalized in the ICU. I was surprisingly to me put on the phone with one of his sisters. I was advised that he was unconcerned and in dire condition. This had happened before and he was brought back to a functioning life. I called one of the two friends whom he called and were there with. He gave me sketchy information. He had not called me even though he knew of my relationship with Maurie. He was on my mind and in my prayers all day. I wasn’t home and able to call and inquire about his condition at which time I was advised that the had died 20 minimum earlier. They had told hospital to n plug his life support equipment. I couldn’t believe my ears. Dead. I was shocked, devasted and speechless. I received a 9 minute telephone call the next morning from one of the sisters telling me he was dead. I was told they would advise me about his funeral arrangements after they were made. It had been his desire and he had told me he had made arrangements to be buried in a cemetery on the campus of his beloved alma mater, the University of Notre Dame (he was heard utter the words “Go Irish” whenever he would encounter another alumni, the phrase is like code words to alert each other of this connection). Instead his body was returned to Chicago for his funeral and buried in the Irish section of a northwest suburban Catholic cemetery. I have spent the past year loving him still, missing him, wishing he wasn’t dead while realizing he “is in a better place, not sick or in pain if what our faith leads us to believe is true”. This doesn’t help with the hurt very much. In 3/2020 I had sufficiently recovered to the extent that I gathered the courage to try to find the second he called the morning that was the beginning of the end for him. She has worked for him ten months, cooking, cleaning, shopping for him taking and picking up his laundry from the Chinese laundry he used. She had made it possible for him to live his life independently as he fiercely desired to the end. His mobility was reduced due to age related health problems. I texted 3 numbers and sent a person who could be her a message through Facebook messenger. A couple of days ago I received a message from her. I had questions about his final days that only she could answer. She had been there and knew the rest of the story. First and foremost she told me he loved me very much and talked about me all the time (I was very surprised because when we talked he always kept his feelings under control, but on occasion has be open about his love for me). I have been unable to sleep and in tears since she described his final hours to me. I have no reason to doubt her words.? She stayed close by him in the ICU and heard a doctor pleading with a key family member to allow the hospital to keep him on the ventilator for 72 hours. He felt there would be a positive change. She also told me that he would react to her voice when she was talking to him. She didn’t think he was brain dead. She stayed with him when the ventilator and machines were turned off and held his hand. He fought for life, it wasn’t a peaceful death. The others deserted him, left him to die alone. She told me their were tears coming from his eyes as he died. He knew what was happening, couldn’t talk or get them to stop the process. He wanted to live. He was a fighter, I found out that his death was not quiet and peaceful. This knowledge has broken my heart, I would never have allowEd him to suffer but I was not consulted nor in a decision making position. After the telephone call I texted his brother with the information I had found out. I asked why couldn’t you have left him on the ventilator and life support for 72 fucking hours? My flood pressure and heart beats had risen. He immediately denied what I had told him had happened and was very angry at me. I shut my phone off and didn’t respond until the morning with a carefully worded text. I didn’t read his texts because I did not want to have a heart attack. I did see a few pertinent sentences one in which he told me to leave his family alone and never contact them again. I was able to send one more carefully worded text before the told me he was blocking me and to stop stalking his family. (They were a family of 6 brothers and 3 sisters. My significant other was the first of the siblings to die.) My significant other was the second in the family. He has an older sister whose mean spirited character defines the word BITCH. In another story I related on Quora (one of my first ventures at a writing on Quora) she is the one who accused me of being a gold digger (I know and knew nothing of his finances, I loved him for his character who he was he made me happy, smile and laugh—I wasn’t interested in someone else’s money). They had a serious argument over me and didn’t speak from January until 5 days before his death). The woman contacted me on messenger just after his death, her Facebook page is private but by her doing this it had anything she might post show up on my Facebook page. She openly snubbed me at his funeral while most the other siblings were civil to me. (I knew about each of them through my significant other talking about them, the rest of the family knew my late husband well as he and my significant other had been close friends high school thru college.). In August the sister asked Facebook friends for prayers for her daughter’s mother-in-law who was very ill similar to life threatening conditioned my late husband experienced. After a few days in a response to another post re the ill woman my name showed up and the sister realized it was me and reacted angrily. Hence, she no doubt told everyone that I was stalking her. She sent me a message on messenger telling me that she didn’t know me, didn’t want to know me and that I had no business following her Facebook page. My husband and her brother had been friends but that friendship ended long ago. She did not acknowledge that her brother and I had had a close relationship for a year and a half. I sent her a terse text before she blocked me. (You would think I was harassing her not just praying for someone at her general request.). I did notice and point out to the brother in the most recent texting before I was blocked that this woman (no I did not refer to her as a bitch) who offended my significant other a year earlier by going behind his back to ask his primary care provider about his health without his permission. This was upsetting for him. (He was very discreet). I called the brother’s attention without response that this sister was posting on Facebook as sling for prayer for the daughter’s mother-in-law but not one asked for emergency prayers for my significant other ever. I noticed and found it strange. When my significant other died she did post about that. Writing about this very painful subject on a public forum has been cathartic for me. Made me feel better. I have not mentioned names or anything particularly identifying. I don’t believe any of the people Involved follow Quora or would recognize themselves. As they say, there are two sides to every story and this is my hurtful story from my point of view.

True love doesn’t involve someone controlling someone else. IF you really love you actually care more about the other person than you care about yourself. A person who controls another person cares first and last about themselves they do not love the other person.\\nIs love messy? It can be or it can be remarkably unmessy it depends on the individuals involved. I have been in love with a man for over 45 years. IT has been non messy.

He's not. He's just trying to see if you'll bite. Probably a cautious covert narcissist. He's heard this trick works, and look, it does. You're asking us about it!
