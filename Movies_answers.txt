And it ended with the ultimate ending: shadows can hide behind things but when the light is reflected on it from the right angle it disappears.", "Hello, Hayden :D\nAs a Star Wars fan, were the prequels political?\nYes. I mean, duh!\nThe whole plot of the prequels was around politics. It was to show that before the corrupt and evil Empire, there was a stable Republic and a democracy going on. Let\u2019s explain politics for each of the movies.\nTHE PHANTOM MENACE\nThe whole movie was about a planetary invasion and a Trade Federation blockade. The Trade Federation, led by the comical Nute Gunray, had stopped all shipments to the peaceful planet of Naboo.\nThis caused the queen of Naboo to be in distress, because her people were suffering. Soon, the Trade Federation invaded Naboo.\nBasically, everything in this movie is politics, but it\u2019s mostly setup for the other prequel movies.\nBelieve me, I get the hate for the politics. I do.\nATTACK OF THE CLONES\nThe politics and slightly simmered down in this movie, probably because of the backlash from TPM, but basically, Chancellor Palpatine (aka Darth Sidious), who was elected in TPM, was trying to gain more power from the Senate.\nSoon, he was granted emergency powers from REPRESENTATIVE DARTH JAR JAR, and a clone army was commissioned for the Grand Army of ZEE REBUPLIC.\nREVENGE OF THE SITH\nWe see the Republic and the Senate slowly fall apart as the Separatists attack further. By the end of ROTS, we see Palpatine in full power of the Senate, commissioning it into The First Galactic Empire.\nWe see the fall of the steady democracy that was once prominent, and up rises the Empire. We see how Palpatine steadily grew in power until the democracy that was once there had fallen.\nAs Padme says:\n\u201cSo this is how liberty dies. With thunderous applause.\u201d\nAs you can see, the prequels were pretty much centered around the politics of the Clone Wars. This sparks controversy for them, but it\u2019s all subjective whether the politics were necassary or not.\nFor those who don\u2019t understand the politics from the prequels, watch Clone Wars (2009 TV show). It really expands the politics, and it explains it in a way that is understandable, as it is a series, and has time to do what the prequel movies probably did not.\nMay the Force be with you all!", "Of course they're political. It's not a matter of opinion, the political nature of the prequels is right there to see.\nOne of the main plot elements of the Phantom Menace is a planetary invasion. Through lobbying from the Trade Federation and political chicanery by Palpatine, the Galactic Senate is temporarily stymied through the corruption of the Chancellor, and only what appears to be a master stroke by Palpatine provokes a response. By then, Naboo's forces and the Gungans have driven off the Federation fleet anyway.\nThrough Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, we see Palpatine gradually tightening his grip over the Senate, using the Clone Wars as an excuse to grant himself more emergency powers, slowly chipping away at the so-called representative power of the Senate, which was in jeopardy from the start through corruption and indolence. This was clearly Lucas illustrating the danger of a complacent democracy, and the threat posed by a charismatic authoritarian when he isn't properly held to account.\nThe Jedi are, in my opinion, a reflection of the Catholic Church, or indeed religious orders in general. They have an almost divine status among the common people, and far too much of a say in the political affairs of the Republic. It says a lot that they felt the duly elected leader of the Republic should be deposed and imprisoned on Jedi authority, simply because Palpatine is a Sith, something which just isn't relevant, or shouldn't be, in a democratic republic. This bears resemblance to the evangelical American right, who push religion in education and government, and would die before electing an atheist or a Muslim.

Invariably that character will be portrayed as \u201cloose\u201d and \u201csexy\u201d.\nMalayali women characters will almost always be \u201ceasy pick\u201d.\nAny male Malayali character will invariably run only tea shops.\n\u201cBit\u201d padam only means Malayalam movies.

Prabhakaran is an Indian name and need not stick to a specific state. I remember a Tamil movie where the comedian portrays a tea shop owner as a Nair shop. Once my schoolmate had asked if all the tea shops in Tamil Nadu is owned by Nair community in Kerala after he watched the comedy scene. I just laughed it off. Logically did the Nair caste people go up in arms over this issue??", "Prabhakaran is a common name in Kerala - pls observe the spelling , an h after b . If I remember the context correctly, Boy was telling retired major that you could call any name u want in a lovely tone and doggie will definitely obey you . Major then called the dog Prabhakaran . It could be his dad's name as previously major mentioned that he was brought up by his single mom.\nNot sure how you infer whatever you mentioned in your question. May be your lack of command over the language would have created this confusion.", "Definitely NO in my opinion.\nBecause if we avoid malayalam movies we would face a severe lack of watchable movies which are very essential in this period.

In the movie Big B, Tamil actor Pasupathi is shown as a Chennai born Police inspector who is more honest and straightforward than the other malayali cops in the movie.\nAnd I agree that there are movies where tamils are portrayed as daily wage labourers but that is because of their political culture. Malayali labourers where a part of unions and uncontrollable by the masters, which caused them to hire labourers from Tamilnadu.

His first album, Infinite (1996), sold poorly, however, and he continued to work menial jobs.\nIn 2020, Eminem\u2019s net worth is estimated at $230 million. This makes him one of the richest rappers in the world, next to the likes of Dr. Dre, Sean Combs, Jay Z and more.", "Eminem, AKA Marshall Mathers, AKA Slim Shady, is an American rapper, originally from Missouri. He is without a doubt, the most notorious and influential white rapper in hip-hop, challenging the stereotypes of rap music.\nEminem is now 44 years old, one of the best-selling hip-hop artists of all time.\nIn 2020, Eminem\u2019s net worth is estimated at $230 million. This makes him one of the richest rappers in the world, next to the likes of Dr. Dre\n, Sean Combs\n, Jay Z\nand more.\nEarly Life\nMarshall Mathers was born in St. Joseph, Missouri on the 17th October 1972. His father Bruce left them and moved to California to start a new family. Eminem had a rough childhood and was often bullied and beat up in school.\nWhen his family was living in Detroit, their home was in a majorly black neighborhood, and thus Eminem was also victim to racial beatings during that time.\nBefore he discovered hip-hop, he was first very passionate about comic books and storytelling. He dropped out of Lincoln High school at 17 years old, and worked at various jobs to help pay the bills.\nHis mother would often throw him out of the house, and neglect him. Whenever she went to play Bingo, Eminem would turn up his stereo and start writing songs.\nCareer\nEminem started performing at rap battles with his friend Mike Ruby when he was only 14. Later on, as his reputation grew, he was recruited by several rap groups, including New Jacks, Soul Intent, and D12.\nHis first solo album, \u2018Infinite\n\u2019, was released in 1996, and was a failure; majorly due to Eminem\u2019s style, and feelings people had towards it at that time. He was told that his style was not cut out for hip hop, and that only motivated him to keep on writing more rhymes.\nIn 1997, he was spotted by Dr. Dre, the founder of Aftermath entertainment, and began working with him. Two years later, The Slim Shady LP was released and went Platinum.\nSince then, Eminem has released multiple albums and sold over 40 million copies in the US alone. He\u2019s collaborated with a wide number of artists and even starred in a movie based on his story.\nToday, Eminem is considered to be one of the best, if not the best, rappers of all time. He\u2019s worked with just about every musician you can think of, including the likes of Ed Sheeran\n, 50 Cent\n, Lil Wayne\n, Rihanna\n, Drake\n, and more.\nHow much money is Eminem worth?\nAs of 2020, Eminem\u2019s net worth is roughly $230 million dollars, putting him high up on the list of richest rappers of all time.\nHighlights\nHere are some of the best highlights of Eminem\u2019s career:\nBillboard Music Awards \u2013 Album of the Year (The Eminem Show, 2002)\nAcademy Awards \u2013 Best Original Song (Lose Yourself, 2003)\nBrit Awards \u2013 Best International Male Solo Artist (2003, 2004)\nVibe Magazine Special Awards \u2013 Best Rapper Alive (2008)\nBillboard Music Awards \u2013 Artist of the Decade (2009)\nMOBO Awards \u2013 Best International Act (2010)\nGrammy Awards \u2013 Best Rap Album (Recovery, 2011)\nBillboard Music Awards \u2013 Top Rap Artist (2014)\nFavorite Quotes from Eminem\n\u201cI say what I want to say and do what I want to do.

Don\u2019t be afraid to be different\nWhen Eminem first started performing at battle raps, he was one of the only white performers. He was victim to a lot of stereotypical harassment, centered about the thought that white people can\u2019t rap. He proved a lot of people wrong, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\n2. Your past does not have to determine your future\nMarshall suffered from a lot of bullying when he was younger, always moving from place to place, and never really staying in one spot long enough to make friends.\nHe could have let these experiences dictate how his life was going to turn out; but instead, he used them as motivation.\n3. Stand up for yourself\nI don\u2019t think that Eminem would be where he is today if he didn\u2019t stand up for himself and for his dreams. Knowing what he wanted, and believing in exactly that, fuelled him for success. Despite people trying to tell them what he could and couldn\u2019t accomplish.\n4. Collaborate with others\nWe mentioned above, just how many people Eminem has collaborated with in his career. And it\u2019s a lot. In fact, when you look at some of his most recent albums, he\u2019s actually made it his mission to collaborate with other artists on each of his songs.\nHe\u2019s done an excellent job of collaborating with other people, and that has allowed him to gain opportunities which produce different styles of music, and help promote his albums to the respective audiences.\n5. Always be adapting\nIf you take a look at the work Eminem produced early on in his career, and compare it with his most recent work; you\u2019ll see that the type of music he produces, and the topics he raps about have changed.\nWhich is interesting, intriguing, and makes for the perfect story of progression both in music and his personal life. The lesson here is don\u2019t be afraid to adapt. You don\u2019t have to continue doing the exact same thing that made you successful in the first place.\n5 Surprising Facts About Eminem\n1. Eminem was still making payments on his trailer home when the Slim Shady LP dropped.\n2. Eminem doesn\u2019t allow people to curse in his home, and he won\u2019t swear in front of children.\n3. Eminem said he used to spend hours every night studying the dictionary, so he could expand his vocabulary for his rhymes.\n4. Before he became a rapper, Eminem\u2019s true dream was to become a comic book artist.\n5. Eminem got evicted the night before the 1997 Rap Olympics, and had to break into his own place and sleep on the floor before leaving for LA.\nSummary\nWell, Marshall Mathers is one of the most successful hip-hop artists in history and one of the 20 richest rappers\nworldwide.\nIn 2020, Eminem\u2019s net worth is estimated to be $230 million.\nHe\u2019s inspired many other artists to climb through the ranks, and he\u2019s also helped people all over the world in dealing with the problems they face in life."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Aman Kumar", "view_list": [214, 37]}, "482": {"no_of_follower": 0, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Heather Kelly"], "question_title": "What performance of Eugenio Siller impressed you?", "topic_list": ["Comedians", "Movies", "Experiences in Life"], "no_of_view": "120", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["NEVER HEARD OF HIM WHO THE HELL IS HE???"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Anonymous", "view_list": [3]}, "240": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "Are you going to miss Irrfan Khan?", "topic_list": ["Bollywood Classroom", "Irrfan Khan (actor)", "Bollywood Actors and Actresses", "Bollywood Movies", "Bollywood", "Celebrities", "Actors and Actresses", "Survey Question"], "no_of_view": "409", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Gaurav Kumar Jha", "view_list": []}, "48": {"no_of_follower": 2, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "Which is the horror movie where demons take over human bodies and there is a scene where the demon rotates a handle and the house starts levitating in the air?", "topic_list": ["Scary Movies", "Demons (malicious preternatural beings)", "Movie Identification", "Horror (genre)", "Horror Movies", "Movie Scenes", "Movie Story and Plot Themes", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "283", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Raghu Srinivasa", "view_list": []}, "534": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["Vikas Gade", "Lili Basu Biswas"], "question_title": "Is Varun Dhawan as talented as Leonardo DiCaprio?", "topic_list": ["Varun Dhawan (actor)", "Leonardo DiCaprio (actor)", "Bollywood Actors and Actresses", "Bollywood", "Celebrities", "Actors and Actresses", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "3,800", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [1, 1], "ans_list": ["No Varun Dhawan is not even talented as Govinda forget Leonardo DiCaprio.", "No no."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Shubham Mohapatra", "view_list": [191, 331]}, "294": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Anurag Srivastava"], "question_title": "Will Argentina be able to control coronavirus in the month of May after the total lockdown?", "topic_list": ["Buenos Aires, Argentina", "Lockdowns", "Argentina", "Security", "COVID-19 (2019-2020)", "International Relations", "Movies", "Medicine and Healthcare"], "no_of_view": "148", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["Covid will eventually be controlled in the all the countries including Argentina.\nThe peak daily infection of covid in Argentina is 294 cases and this occurred on 15-Apr-20 (taken from worldometers web site).

A statement released by his family said that Mr Khan spent his final hours \"surrounded by his love, his family for whom he most cared about.\" Just hours ago, the actor's spokesperson said in a statement that Mr Khan was \"still fighting the battle.\" The Piku star, one of Indian cinema's most respected thespians, battled a tumour for several months and returned to Mumbai some months ago after being treated in London.

Yesterday, his spokesperson confirmed that he had been taken to the intensive care unit and later, dismissed rumours that Irrfan Khan had died.\nRead the statement released on behalf of Irrfan Khan's family:\n\"I trust, I have surrendered\"; These were the some of the many words that Irrfan expressed in a heart-felt note he wrote in 2018 opening up about his fight with cancer. And a man of few words and an actor of silent expressions with his deep eyes and his memorable actions on screen. It's saddening that this day, we have to bring forward the news of him passing away. Irrfan was a strong soul, someone who fought till the very end and always inspired everyone who came close to him. After having been struck by lightning in 2018 with the news of a rare cancer, he took life soon after as it came and he fought the many battles that came with it. Surrounded by his love, his family for whom he most cared about, he left for heaven abode, leaving behind truly a legacy of his own. We all pray and hope that he is at peace.

Qissa: The Tale of a Lonely Ghost (2014)\nThe film is set during the times of partition and Irrfan plays Umber Singh, a father with a male-child-obsession. When the family gets blessed with yet another girl, his obsession clouds his sanity and he assumes with his mind, body and soul that finally, he has a son who will continue his lineage. Irrfan makes Umber Singh believably stern, insane, unpredictably mad, brutal and doting at the same time. You abhor him for his neglect towards everyone else but you feel sorrow and helplessness when his pretense becomes his all-consuming reality.\n12. The Warrior (2001)\nThis film put Irrfan on the map for the first time. It was helmed by Asif Kapadia \u2013 a British filmmaker who later went on to win numerous awards (including an Academy award) for his documentaries \u2018Amy\u2019 and \u2018Senna\u2019. It is about a warrior, Lafcadia, who begins to question the purposeless killings of innocent people which he has carried out for a living and decides to abandon the path of violence. But, his grim past catches up with him sooner than he thought. Irrfan speaks bare minimum lines and for most of the part lets his silence convey the storm within. It is quite surprising that such a fine movie is yet to be discovered by the masses.\n11. Life in a Metro (2007)\nThe film was a blatant composition of classics \u2013 \u2018The Apartment\u2019 and \u2018Brief Encounter\u2019, but, I fondly remember it for Monty (Irrfan) and Shruti (Konkona Sen). This particular story and its two characters in a set of numerous parallel stories stayed with me. Irrfan plays a 35 year old man (38 in reality) seeking a bride through matrimonial sites and familial connections. Konkona happens to be one of the many girls he meets in the process. And rest is as funny as it gets. All the conversations between these two evoke genuine laughter.\n10. Life of Pi (2012)\nThe best word that describes Irrfan Khan\u2019s performance in \u2018Life of Pi\u2019 is \u201csublime\u201d. Few actors in the world, let alone India, are as effortless as Khan, and that effortlessness shows clearly in the film, especially, when he had only a few scenes to make a mark. He makes most of the 10-15 minutes that he has in the film so much so that there was a serious talk of him getting nominated for Best Supporting Actor Oscar. It didn\u2019t materialize, though. One day, it will, if he keeps giving such great performances.\n9. Yeh Saali Zindagi (2011)\nThis is an impeccable film in caper genre. Sudhir Mishra \u2013 one of the finest directors \u2013 chose Irrfan to play Arun, an astute Chartered Accountant and a hopeless romantic rendered helpless due to matters of heart. He invites unnecessary trouble due to his association with Priti (Chitrangada Singh). Nonetheless, he continues his struggle out of the murky pit in the hope of reciprocation. This yarn has many threads and each one has been knit deftly with the other. In an assemblage of fine actors, Irrfan delivers a sucker punch with his acting chops as well as his narration. His conversations with Saurabh Shukla (another stalwart) are one of the highlights of this film. Its ironical that Irrfan\u2019s name always conjures up an image of a serious character artiste while in reality, he has breathed life to enviable comic performances as well \u2013 Yeh Saali Zindagi being a case in point.\n8. Piku (2015)\nPiku emerged as a darling of critics and audiences alike and deservedly so. Shoojit Sircar\u2019s slice-of-life film brought together three of the most talented artistes working in Indian cinema. Amitabh Bachchan plays Bhaskor Bannerjee \u2013 a Bengali father fraught with constipation-induced anxiety \u2013 and Deepika plays Piku \u2013 a freethinking, dutiful daughter who believes in \u201csex-is-a-need\u201d theory. Irrfan\u2019s Rana likes Piku and his infatuation lands him in a road trip with this eccentric father-daughter duo. It is often said that the most difficult characters to play are the normal ones, those characters which are devoid of any peculiar behaviour, accent and mannerism. Rana was one such character. It lacked the idiosyncracies of a Bhaskor or a Piku. And yet Irrfan stood tall as Rana and gave his audience another memorable performance.\nRelated: Best Amitabh Bachchan Movies\n7. Talvar (2015)\nIrrfan played Ashwin Kumar, a character based on Arun Kumar who became in-charge of the case when it was handed over to the CBI. Ashwin takes it up while undergoing a personal turmoil, investigates it right from scratch and gets consumed in the process. Irrfan not only perfectly displayed the frustration and helplessness an officer experiences when he uncovers absurd incompetency and inappropriate procedure, he also made it increasingly tangible for his audience. He keeps us at the edge of our seats and soon enough we join him in the investigation, examining suspects, decrypting the motive, drawing and weighing conclusions. He made us share his disgust for the corrupt, his failure to exact justice for the accused parents and subsequent despair.\n6. Haider (2014)\nAs soon as Khurram wins the election, an eerie hum by the chorus accompanies muezzin\u2019s azan and we witness the first view of Kashmir valley and Aishmuqam Dargah getting draped in snow. With this scene, Vishal Bhardwaj announces the season transition and lulls the audience; only to shake them violently the very next moment with a sudden, jolting background score which reaches a crescendo. And enters \u2013 Roohdaar. Irrfan admitted in an interview that one become an actor so that one day he gets to grace a scene like this. Irrfan had a special appearance in Haider and he made each and every second of it \u2013 well, special.\n5. The Lunchbox (2013)\nYou don\u2019t have much at your disposal when for larger part of your screen time you are supposed to sit on a chair in a government office and marvel at your lunchbox, do you? Irrfan proved that you do. He played Saajan Fernandez, a middle-aged, loyal and efficient government official who falls in love over a series of delicious lunchboxes and accompanying letters. He savours the dishes like a gourmet but never forgets to let the audience in on the aroma. Gradually, he creates an equation with us and before long we become pro at correctly guessing the contents of the letters as well as the lunchbox just by looking at his face. Stellar performance!\n4. The Namesake (2006)\nIrrfan played Ashoke Ganguli who hails from West Bengal, joins MIT as a graduate student and later becomes a professor. It was a multilayered role with a different set of characteristics, sensibilities and leitmotifs. Irrfan submerged himself into the world of Ashoke and made it his own. He painted Ashoke\u2019s mannerisms, relationships, fears and motivations with a touch of an accomplished artiste. He, along with Tabu, created a credible Bengali couple (sans theatrics) who migrate to US for better opportunities and struggle to fit in as well as remain attached to their roots. And, when Ashoke dies, the emptiness hits you like a bolt of lightning and you realise the stark reality of existence and how easily it will be wiped off leaving behind a void.\n3. Paan Singh Tomar (2012)\nPick Irrfan and throw him into any milieu in any part of India and you will be surprised with the degree to which he appears deep rooted in it. \u2018Paan Singh Tomar\u2019 is an example of such striking ability. This film, made on a meagre budget, remained under production for quite a long time and one thought that it will eventually be shelved. Even after getting rave reviews at festivals in 2010, it took 2 more years to release \u2018Paan Singh Tomar\u2019 in Indian theatres. And when it released, Irrfan\u2019s performance left everybody stunned. He played the eponymous role of an award winning steeplechase runner who resorts to arms to exact revenge from the corrupt system and its structures. It was a highly unconventional choice for Irrfan and there was a fair degree of skepticism regarding him pulling it off. But he did and did it with Irrfanesque swag. He went through a phased physical transformation, trained hard to fit the structure of an athlete and dissolved himself into the rural mould. He was not some actor playing a character from hinterland, he became Paan Singh in entirety. Not even a single note was off in his rendition.\n2. Haasil (2003)\nIrrfan \u2013 fed up of the kind of unimaginative roles coming his way \u2013 had all but decided to pack his belongings and head back. And then Tigmanshu offered him the role of Ranvijay Singh. In hindsight, I can\u2019t think of any other actor who would have played Ranvijay better than Irrfan. Ranvijay\u2019s character arc was delightfully mysterious. A student leader \u2013 worried about the dwindling support to his party \u2013 empathises with a hot-headed yet innocent college boy Aniruddh and becomes his trusted confidante only to savagely betray him later in order to forcefully marry his girlfriend \u2013 Niharika. Ranvijay possessed chameleon like shades. His transformation from a friend, philosopher and guide to a murderer, abductor and an unpredictable ticking time bomb is wildly exciting. You find yourself stupefied when Ranvijay reveals his cards eventually. Irrfan grabbed this chance at his disposal and erupted on the screen with brute force."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Shubham Raj", "view_list": [326, 100, 28]}, "211": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["Punit", "Basheer Khan"], "question_title": "What are the top movies and web series released online during a lockdown?", "topic_list": ["Web Series Recommendation", "Web Series", "Lockdowns", "Movie Lists", "Movie Recommendations", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "358", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "ans_list": ["Special ops, Extraction, She, Money Heist", "Xtraction"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Mohammad Wasi", "view_list": [1, 5]}, "855": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "Why is Bollywood called \u2018Bollywood\u2019?", "topic_list": ["Cinema of India", "Movie Business and Industry", "Bollywood", "Movies", "India"], "no_of_view": "395", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Ayush Ramawat", "view_list": []}, "68": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What do you think about the novel \"Suraj Ka Satwan Ghoda\" by Dharamveer Bharti and the movie of the same name by Shyam Benegal?", "topic_list": ["Novel Recommendations", "Cinema of India", "Novels", "Bollywood Movies", "Literature", "Books", "Movies", "India", "Survey Question"], "no_of_view": "181", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Kshitij Kabir (\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0924\u093f\u091c \u0915\u092c\u0940\u0930)", "view_list": []}, "688": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 9, "name_list": ["Shirley Rombough", "Cheryl Weissman", "Marc Josloff", "Jasmine Cannon", "Nurah-Janet Dennis", "Carolyn McMaster", "Leo Barker", "Lawrence Stone", "Joseph Siegel"], "question_title": "If I'm talking about a movie, or an incident itself, can I use is?

Anything not listed in there belongs to you still.\nFor example, if they claim US publishing rights, you can still take your book to a European publisher and publish in that territory through them. All books printed and distributed in the US will have one publisher on the cover, the European ones will have another. Sometimes publishers do this because they know they can\u2019t make use of that right (say they don\u2019t have the infrastructure ot distribute to another continent) and every right they buy should be adding money to your pot because they are taking things you could sell elsewhere for more money.\nThings like film/TV rights, comic adaptations, merchandising stuff are commonly not asked for because publishers of novels are usually not in a position to make use of them - they are not a production company, a comic publisher or a factory that makes toys. You keep those and can choose to sell those rights to someone else who can make use of them (though check carefully\u2026 maybe get a lawyer and/or your agent if you have one to read the contract and advise).\nSo, when you sell the rights, you do so with terms you or your representative negotiates with the buyer. This will include upfront cash, royalties, credit on the finished product (that old \u2018based on a book by\u2026\u2019 mention).\nThis is why having an agent is a good idea if you can get one. Their role is to understand contracts and negotiate better deals while preventing pitfalls like \u2018accidentally\u2019 signing away your TV rights.\nNot sure about graphic novel rights but I do know that TV/Film rights routinely get bought for a time (author gets small amount of money) and the company has a set amount of time to use them or lose them (or have to pay again). After which, whatever payments are in the contract for royalties etc come into play.", "It absolutely depends on the agreements you made with those creators of the subsidiary works.

You can\u2019t go back on an agreement you made because someone else got successful with a licensed work, though.\nIf you didn\u2019t make any agreements or assign them those rights, then you DEFINITELY could sue them for the money they\u2019re making, because they didn\u2019t secure the rights legally and they violated your copyright.

Meaning, while footage is being gathered or captured, the news is being edited together on the fly while inserting all other elements like titles and graphics. This is what is known as online editing. There are no second chances or there is no \u201cwe need to go back and reshoot this\u201d or \u201cwe need some additional footage\u201d. What this means for the director in charge is that he needs to get it right the first time and he has to do it fast.", "There are different levels throughout the \u201cmedia\u201d process.\nNews is usually shot with a professional camera and either an editor, cameraman or even reporter will edit it into the final piece. In this case, post is literally just editing the piece to the script and narration/interviews etc the reporter has provided. They might be able to dissolve or wipe, but few do because used incorrectly - it can be distracting to the story and telling a clear story is after all the point of the whole thing.\nNews shows like 2020, or Dateline have quite a bit of post production involved often with graphics, animation, color correction. Entertainment tonight - if you consider that a \u201cnews\u201d show has more stuff flying in and out and around than Barnum Bailey\u2019s Circus\u2026 a ton of post production work to do that show.\nNews documentaries, which are related to shows like I mentioned, can have extensive post work including color grading and audio post.\nA simple movie can be in post-production for many months or longer\u2026 a news story will take an hour or 90 minutes\u2026 so movies spend a lot more time in post.\nThat can be a factor of how much footage there is to review and choose from, it maybe because there are a lot of special effects involved from digital 3d sets to advanced color grading.\nIf you ever have the chance to see the extended boxed edition of the Lord of the Rings movies there are hours and hours of documentaries about the post work done in that movie\u2014- tremendous docs.\nSo the major difference will be time spent. Getting the salient script points layouted will take longer because you have many more takes to choose from and of course the news airs as soon as it can\u2026 especially with cable. Most storyies are done as fast as possible.\nMovies are in post a long time and directors and/or producers may spend a lot of time trying different cuts and different versions of cuts.\nYou have heard if not seen of \u201cdirector cuts\u201d of movies. Well\u2026 directors get very close to the project\u2026 they fall in love with certain scenes, or actors, or camera sets ups and want it all in the movie. That\u2019s when someone from the studio has to come in and say we need a 100 minute cut of the film\u2026 not a 180 minute cut of the film\u2026 so they have the editor, or other\u2019s decide what can be taken out and still tell the story\u2026 in all the deleted scenes you will see as extras the comment will say something like this: \u201cI loved Isabella in this scene, but we decided it took the story in a direction that we never came back to\u2026 but it was a great scene.\u201d\nSo those are some of the differences between news and movie post\u2026 there are a lot more like money and especially time."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Javier Garcia", "view_list": [16, 46]}, "623": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 3, "name_list": ["M Glad", "Maddie Bradley", "Angela Towey"], "question_title": "What are the top 5 favorite movies in your opinion this past decade (2010-2019)?", "topic_list": ["Watching Movies", "Movie Reviews", "Movie Lists", "Entertainment", "Movie Recommendations", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "1,456", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0], "ans_list": ["1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.", "Joker, Call Me By Your Name, Lady Bird, Dunkirk, and Little Women are all really amazing movies.

As there was too much going on at the end, many people got confused about some parts.\nSo let's talk about the complicated ending here.\nJong-goo is a police officer trying to solve the mysterious murders happening in a small village named Gokseong. All the villagers point out a stranger from Japan who lives in a jungle nearby. People think he is a demon and some people claim that they have seen him with glaring red eyes preying animals. But Jong-goo doesn\u2019t believe them.\nHe goes to the Japanese stranger\u2019s house to investigate, and there he finds the pictures of all the victims on the stranger\u2019s wall. He runs away with fear and the next day when he comes back, there are no pictures on the wall and the stranger denies everything. After that, Jong-goo\u2019s daughter gets sick and shows the same symptoms the villagers showed before they died.\nThere is also a mysterious lady in the story who tells him about different things and nobody knows her name or where she lives. So, the story continues and the audience sits there with boggled minds. And there is also a shaman in the story who claims that he can slay any kind of demon with his powers. So, Jong-goo takes his help to cure his daughter of the disease as he thinks this might be because of that old man. But who really is the killer in the story? Is the stranger really a demon who kills people with his magic. Or the mysterious lady is the killer? All these answers are revealed in the end.\n*Spoiler Alert*\nIn the climax scene, we see that:\nThe shaman tells Jong-goo that the stranger is not the demon. that mysterious girl is. And he has to run away to save his family from her.\nBut the girl claims she is not the demon, she is just there to save his family from the Japanese and the shaman who are actually working together.\nJong-goo gets confused and doesn\u2019t believe the lady who is clearly not a human being.\nThe lady says to him that she has set a trap for the demon at his house, if he stays with her for a little longer, his family will be safe but if he goes back home, his family will die.\nBut Jong-goo believes the shaman and runs back home where his daughter, who is possessed, has killed his wife and mother in law.\nAnd then we see the shaman entering their house to click pictures of the dead bodies. He has a wooden box in his hands in which there are pictures of all the victims killed by them.\nSo actually what happens is that the lady is a ghost who protects the village from evil powers.

It is interesting to know that Ace Maestro Naushad started his innings at Lucknow with this type of bands under Ustad Babban Khan and Yusuf Ali Khan. This practice later paid him high dividends that he emerged as most authentic background music composer.\nWhen sound was added later from film Alam Ara even then there were no music directors.

Background music was done by the foreigners.\nRC Boral, Shyam Sunder, Puknaj Mullick and Anil Biswas were the early batch of Music directors but they did not have any status. Even their credits appeared in chorus and no special slide was used for them. There were no playbacks also. Songs were recorded on actor singers during the shooting in one take after making several rehearsals. The music scene was dominated by Rabindra Sangeet and later some Muslim music directors added Punjabi lure when production started in Bombay and Lahore. Ustad jhande Khan, Ghulam Haider, Mushtaq Ahemd etc were the prominent music directors.\nIt was Anil Biswas who first grasped the nuances of Western music in films like harmony, counter melody, and other styles. A hit film of that era was Kismat that ran for three years with success.\nNaushad joined the scene. He accepts the contribution of Anil Biswas in training and helping in in early stage as his mentor. There was mono recordings on one track. The Cutler Feeder microphone required to be heated for some time before it could pick up. Naushad brought Hindustani music ( the folk music of Uttar Pradesh). His film Rattan was a super hit. The entire cost of the film was Rs 75000 but it earned royalty of music only for Rs, 3,50000. There was no looking back for Naushad and rested of the developments and styles he gets the credit> At the age of 21 years he earned a \u2018Star status\u2019 of being the only music director in Film industry whose name was enough to sell the film all over India.

The theatrical window has been shrinking for decades. Yes, it sucks for the buggy-whip manufacturers, but at the end of the day you either evolve with the times or you die out. AMC is taking the stance of, \u201cYou can\u2019t kill us, we will kill ourselves!\u201d\nMeanwhile, COVID-19 has shut down all theaters, putting the already-broke AMC \u2014 which ran a $5 billion deficit in December 2019 \u2014 into major financial straits. And AMC picks now to try and play hardball with a company like NBCUniversal that is launching its own streaming service very soon?\nCan AMC survive without movies like James Bond, Fast and Furious, and Blumhouse pictures? NBCU can survive without AMC. All the major studios know they can and will have to survive without theaters, which is why so much money and effort was put into launching Disney+, HBO Max, CBS All-Access, Peacock, and others I have forgotten to mention. The studios all know that streaming is the future, and that in all probability only big budget tentpoles will be screened in theaters in the future. The change \u2014 with mid-budget movies skipping theaters entirely \u2014 has been happening slowly for years, and will only be hastened by COVID-19 and bad business decisions like this one from AMC.\nLike buggy-whip manufacturers, and dinosaurs viewing an incoming asteroid, theater chains like AMC are evolving far too slowly in today\u2019s fast-paced technological revolution. This means they will be left behind in the not too distant future. It makes me wonder if, now that studios are allowed to own theaters again, if one of the big studios like Disney or Netflix or even Apple will simply buy AMC. Perhaps new management can bring about a better financial situation for a company that should have been swimming in profit after a 2019 which saw the highest grossing movie of all time.\nWhile I\u2019m sure the situation between AMC and Universal will get worked out (playing hardball is part of the negotiation process, after all), part of me wonders if this moment will go down in history like Blockbuster\u2019s refusal to buy a pre-streaming Netflix in 2000 for only $50 million.

The first movie Iron Man built up an entire universe with Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America as the main heroes of the universe. The marvel studios gave a hint to their fans by showing it in the first avengers movie post credits scene, that there was someone who was way more powerful than Loki and was somewhere in the universe. The wonderful work done by all the CGI teams, the story writers, all the directors, producers, the cast, the crew of the entire marvel cinematic universe, are the reasons of the massive success of Avengers Endgame.\nNow talking about the second factor. Initially the movie earnt more than 2 billion dollars, and they were a few hundred thousand away from defeating the then all time mega blockbuster film, Avatar. The movie Avengers Endgame was hoped to defeat Avatar, the highest grossing film of all time(past). The re-release of the film changed everything. They introduced a few deleted clips from the movie which were originally cut out, and they also added a tribute to stanley at the end of the film.\nSo the huge success of the film was not only because of the cast, it was a combined effort of the cast, crew and the fans of the marvel cinematic universe all around.\nI hope i answered your question.\nUpvote if you liked it, and follow if you loved it.\nPeace\nVedant Mistry"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Akshay Misal", "view_list": [4, 408]}, "677": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What are the film industries worried about?", "topic_list": ["Worrying", "Movie Production", "Movie Business and Industry", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "132", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Daanish Mundroina", "view_list": []}, "909": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "How many awards Irfan Khan had won in his career?", "topic_list": ["Irrfan Khan (actor)", "Academy Awards", "Honors and Recognition", "Bollywood Actors and Actresses", "Bollywood", "Actors and Actresses", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "324", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Dpk Chaudhary", "view_list": []}, "661": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "Do Bollywood actors and actresses fall in love with each other in real life while shooting a movie?", "topic_list": ["Falling in Love", "Acting", "Bollywood Actors and Actresses", "Bollywood Movies", "Hollywood", "Movie Business and Industry", "Bollywood", "Actors and Actresses", "Love", "Movies", "Dating and Relationships"], "no_of_view": "684", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Abhishek Pandey", "view_list": []}, "1": {"no_of_follower": 3, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What are the 10 cult classic sci-fi audiences that ignored the first time?", "topic_list": ["Cult Classics", "Science Fiction Books", "Cults", "Science Fiction Movies", "1980s", "Science Fiction (genre)", "Movie Recommendations", "Television Series", "Books", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "393", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Manny Santos", "view_list": []}, "441": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 3, "name_list": ["Akhilesh Mishra", "Jitendra Pal", "Amol Jogire"], "question_title": "What are some famous movies of Irfan Khan?", "topic_list": ["Irrfan Khan (actor)", "Movie Lists", "Bollywood Actors and Actresses", "Bollywood Movies", "Movie Recommendations", "Bollywood", "Actors and Actresses", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "878", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0], "ans_list": ["", "Some latest movies of irfan khan:\nAngrezi Medium\nHindi Medium\nBlackmail\nThe Lunchbox\nQarib Qarib single\nBillu Barber\nMadaari\nPiku\nKarwaan\nMaqbool\nPuzzle\nJazbaa\nD-Day\nRog\nThe song of Scorpians\nKnock out\nthe killer etc.", "There is Which is Irfan Khan's best movie?\nthe 25 best films of irfan khan."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Kejariwal Manisha Kumari", "view_list": [59, 19, 3]}, "825": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "Why did Dutch leave John to die?", "topic_list": ["People of the Netherlands", "Dutch (language)", "The Netherlands", "Movie Story and Plot Themes", "Fictional Characters", "Death and Dying", "Movies", "Philosophy of Everyday Life"], "no_of_view": "382", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Cozma Dan Claudiu", "view_list": []}, "231": {"no_of_follower": 2, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["Nick Lilavois", "Kelly Russo"], "question_title": "Why does Damon drive his car when he can use his vampire super-speed?", "topic_list": ["Damon Salvatore", "The Vampire Diaries (TV series)", "Superpowers (special powers)", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "195", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "ans_list": ["Why does Damon drive his car when he can use his vampire super-speed?\nEven with super-speed he does get tired.\nWhy run when you can drive?\nEven the Flash drives a car.", "Damon loved that car.

Venom\nWe first saw Venom on screen in Spider-Man 3. Venom is an interesting villain because it\u2019s a symbiote that can only exist with another person. Some of the most interesting scenes in Spider-Man 3 feature Venom and even Spider-Man\u2019s personality takes an interesting turn when he\u2019s \u201cpossessed\u201d by Venom. He even got his own film with Tom Hardy that went on to become of the highest-grossing films of 2018.\n2. Magneto\nMagneto is definitely a villain in X-Men, but he\u2019s also very sympathetic. We know that his hatred of humans comes from the mistreatment he\u2019s suffered over the years. Also, with the character being played by two of the finest actors \u2013 Sir Ian McKellen and Michael Fassbender, it\u2019s hard for us to not feel at least a little bit tempted to be on his side.\n3. Loki\nThere\u2019s perhaps no villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far who has a larger fan following than Loki. His popularity may have a lot to do with Tom Hiddleston, but the complexity of the character, especially when compared to Thor, makes us love him a lot more than many Marvel heroes. Although Thanos did manage to build up his own following as a Marvel villain, he wasn\u2019t as well-liked. Loki will also be getting his exclusive series on Disney\u2019s new streaming platform.\n4. Hannibal Lecter\nHannibal Lecter is another one of those villains who overshadows the hero \u2013 whether it\u2019s in movies or on a television show. Yes, he eats humans but he also knows exactly how to manipulate people and come off as a gentleman in front of others. Anthony Hopkins\u2018 portrayal of Hannibal in The Silence of the Lambs not only gave us nightmares but also had us floored. Hannibal also got his own show with Mads Mikkelsen giving another brilliant portrayal of the character.\n5. Darth Vader\nEven those who only vaguely know Star Wars have heard of Darth Vader \u2013 that\u2019s how far the popularity of this villain goes. He\u2019s one of Hollywood\u2019s greatest villains and also one of the most loved. There are even fans who debate that the Empire that\u2019s shown to us as evil actually did nothing wrong and hail Darth Vader as a hero.\n6. Tyler Durden\nFight Club couldn\u2019t have been what it was if it wasn\u2019t for Brad Pitt\u2018s Tyler Durden. Yes, we learn that he was the hero all along, but it was his Tyler Durden identity that was charismatic and capable enough to organize hundreds of followers behind him. Even knowing all his faults, it\u2019s hard not to be captivated by Tyler Durden.\n7. Pennywise\nWhile The Losers Club had its charm, there\u2019s no doubt that what made It so compelling to watch was Pennywise. The evil creature that awakes every twenty-seven years was brilliantly portrayed by Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, who even scared some of the child actors on set while filming the movie. He\u2019s returning in the sequel, It: Chapter 2, which comes out this September.\n8. Maleficient\nDisney princesses are famous enough but they share pretty much the same story arcs, which is also the case with Aurora aka Sleeping Beauty. The evil witch in that story got a more interesting take with the 2014 film, Maleficent, as we explored how she came to be the way that she is. We\u2019ll get to see Angelina Jolie play her once again in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil this October.\n9. Jack Torrance\nThe Shining showed Jack Torrance\u2019s chilling descent into insanity and it became one of Jack Nicholson\u2018s most famous roles. It\u2019s not the relatively sane Jack when you think of the classic horror film, it\u2019s the crazed Jack peeking from the hole in the door, saying \u201cHere\u2019s Johnny!\u201d. The Shining also gets a sequel this year with Doctor Sleep with Ewan McGregor playing Jack\u2019s son, Danny.\n10. The Joker\nOne of Batman\u2019s many enemies but the most popular of them all, The Joker has been popular in almost any version. He\u2019s been played by many esteemed actors \u2013 Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, and Jared Leto, to name a few. It was only a matter of time before he got his own DC film.

Meanwhile Marvel was doing excellently with the Avengers and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nFor Marvel Spider-Man was a nice-to-get-character, not a need-to-have-character. They could have made every movie since without Spider-Man, and they would still have been succesful.\nSony, who was bombing, needed to get on board the succes train of Marvel.\nWhen two parties are negotiating, the one who is more desperate to make the deal will always end up accepting more terms. The agreement will always end up favoring the stronger party more.\nThis is what happened when Sony made the original deal with Marvel back in the day. And now it would have been turned around.\nOf course that doesn\u2019t mean Sony would agree to anything. But as far as as creative input and final say goes, they would have no reason to fight over that. Because what they\u2019d be after is in fact Marvel\u2019s creative decision making. They\u2019d want Marvel to take those reins and do with Spider-Man what they had done with the MCU characters. They\u2019d have zero reason to want to interfere with that.\nAnd of course Marvel would also not want Sony to get any creative control that would impact the MCU in any way.\nSo technically Sony might have some sort of final creative control because they own the (filming rights to) the character and could decide to block everything, stop paying the bills etc.\nBut practically I don\u2019t think they have any say whatsoever.\n*) Marvel Entertainment has licensed the filming rights to Sony back in the day when they were only a comics publisher, and this contract is in place for as long as Sony desires to make use of the character"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "George Dickson", "view_list": [14, 41]}, "949": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["Anuradha Singh", "Krisha Sharma"], "question_title": "Why was Irrfan Khan admitted to ICU on April 28?", "topic_list": ["Intensive Care Units", "Irrfan Khan (actor)", "Intensive Care", "Hospitals", "Bollywood Actors and Actresses", "Pregnancy", "Bollywood", "Actors and Actresses", "Movies", "Medicine and Healthcare"], "no_of_view": "3,659", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "ans_list": ["Considering it is still April 28th and it has just been few hours, I am surprised you are asking this here instead of checking the news for update.\nAnyhow, according to latest reports he was admitted to hospital due to a colon infection.\nHis health had suddenly deteriorated as a result of which he needed immediate medical attention and was rushed to the hospital[1].\nThe news was confirmed by his spokesperson this evening who also added that he was in ICU and under observation.[2]\nFootnotes\n[1] Irrfan Khan Hospitalised in Mumbai with Colon Infection, Kept Under Observation\n[2] Irrfan Khan hospitalised in Mumbai following colon infection; actor currently under observation, says spokesperson- Entertainment News, Firstpost", "Days after his mother's demise, Irrfan Khan is hospitalised at Mumbai based Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital, reports India Today.\nThe actor's health suddenly deteriorated as a result of which he needed immediate medical attention.

Curiously enough, Brazil's neighbours are almost all spanish-speaking also. Portuguese is widely spoken all over the world, but almost nothing if compared to spanish, so both Brazilian and Portuguese cultures have limited reach outside their borders.\nSo there's a chance English-speaking countries have a lot more close contact with a historically more cosmopolitan culture with whole lots more participation in major European events, like France, Germany or Italy do.

It usually occurs just before a scene takes place but I\u2019ve also seen it occur during or even at the very end a scene.\nA good example of an establishing shot comes from Seinfeld the TV show when the exterior of a New York City restaurant is shown just before a scene showing the characters sitting inside the restaurant. The exterior of the restaurant is the establishing shot because it shows where the drama will takes place.\nAn establishing shot could be long shot of New York City from a plane, a sign on a door, the exterior of an airport, a ranch, a haunted house, or a close up of drinks on a tray being carried to a table by a waiter. The shot provides the audience with details which may include all or any of the following: the atmosphere, the mood, the weather, the time of day, the location, the wealth or affluence of the characters, the year that the scene takes place, etc.\nA master shot is an overall shot of a dramatized scene that includes all the actors who are in the scene. The master shot can also be used for the establishing shot.\nThe master shot shows the audience the location of the actors in relationship to one another. The camera that films the master shot usually stays planted in one spot and does not move . The shot gives the audience information on the perspective and placement of the characters within the scene and the action or atmosphere occurring around the characters.\nThe master shot can be used for the entire length of the scene or inter-cut between closeups of the actors. For instance the master shot on The Jerry Seinfeld Show for a dramatized scene that takes place inside the restaurant might be a mid-distance mid-level shot of the four actors sitting at cafeteria style table or booth. This shot could be used through the entire scene uncut or it could be edited between other shots or close-ups as the actors react to each other during the scene.", "The term \u201cestablishing shot\u201d is a description of how a shot functions in the finally edited movie.

Irfan was born in a Muslim Pathan family in Jaipur, Rajasthan. He was battling cancer for some time. Irfan breathed his last at Kokilaben Hospital in Mumbai. For all, it is nothing short of a shock.\nIrfan's father traded tires. Irfan was a vegetarian since childhood, despite being a Pathan family. Because of this, his father always used to tease him by saying that a Brahmin was born in the Pathan family. After coming into the industry, Irfan struggled a lot. His father died when he entered NSD. After which Irfan stopped getting money from home. He finished his course through a fellowship from NSD.\nIrrfan Khan married his classmate Sutapa Sikander in 1995. Sutapa always stood by her during the days of Irrfan's struggle. At first, both the families were not ready for Irrfan and Sutapa's wedding but later agreed. Irfan has two sons Babil and Ayan.\nIrrfan Khan acted in many memorable films in his career. Irrfan was also active in Hollywood along with Bollywood. He acted in films like 'Spider-Man', 'Jurassic World' and 'Inferno'. Hollywood actor Tom Hanks once praised him saying that Irrfan's eyes also act.\nIrrfan Khan received that year's Filmfare Award for 'Best Villain' for the film 'Hasta'. After that Irrfan has produced 'Maqbool', 'Lunchbox', 'Life in a Metro', 'New York', 'The Namesake', 'Paan Singh Tomar', 'Talwar', 'Madari', 'Haider', 'Piku' and Worked in excellent films like 'Hindi Medium'.\nIrrfan Khan received the National Award in 2013 for the film 'Paan Singh Tomar'.

So trying to appease one group of fans or another by erasing any movies would be foolish.", "Which Star Wars fans exactly?\nStar Wars is a Phenomenon that has attracted fans of all different cultures, age groups, personality types and agendas.\nIt\u2019s not like Star Trek which MAINLY attracts fans of a specific personality type.\nStar Wars has many clashes between fans whilst Star Trek although it still does have clashes is far less prone to these.\nStar Trek has always worn its political agenda on its sleeve - Roddenberry was very particular about this when he was alive and I do find it funny watching certain You-Tubers who I usually agree with btw performing mental somersaults over their mythologising of older Trek compared to new.\nSometimes they\u2019ll even take blatantly political episodes from ToS, TNG or DS9 and go on and on about how they were done well as opposed to Discovery/Picard - The ONLY REAL DIFFERENCE is that those were one-off episodes not part of a whole on-going storyline!\nThey\u2019ll praise the Prime Directive one minute whilst denigrating it the next - I\u2019ve never got the HATE for Insurrection which I personally consider the best of the TNG era Movies! The Prime Directive is blatantly disregarded by Starfleet in this film yet Star Trek fans will go on and on about how the Ba\u2019ku being non-indigenous means they have no rights and Picard/Data etc. should have just let Starfleet and the So\u2019na exterminate them! Heck the film had to blatantly spell-out that the So\u2019na leader in particular was EVIL and even that wasn\u2019t enough for Trek fans!\nBut then again - I\u2019m a Star Wars fan, I\u2019m a Doctor Who fan, I\u2019m a Stargate fan BUT DESPITE having watched every single episode of Star Trek and every film I\u2019ve never considered myself a Star Trek fan - I have too many political disagreements with its whole schtick\u2026I especially dislike DS9 which I found much harder to watch than either Discovery or Picard!\nNow coming back to Star Wars - I AM A STAR WARS FAN but I don\u2019t consider Disney\u2019s Star Wars to be Star Wars! I loathe Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith! I\u2019m still waiting to be ALLOWED to WATCH the Original Trilogy PROPERLY again since Lucas decided to literally BAN IT!\nI actually enjoyed The Last Jedi despite its flaws but probably because I knew going in that after The Farce Awakens had literally destroyed Han and Leia\u2019s marriage, fridged Luke and wiped out the New Republic THIS WASN\u2019T STAR WARS!\nRogue One is a good movie and the closest Disney has come to making an actual Star Wars movie by far! But it does aim for the popular perception of Star Wars and ignores the Canon/Lore that was already there because of course most people haven\u2019t read any of the books! I know WHY Mon Mothma appears at Yavin 4 {because popular perception is that she\u2019s the leader of the Rebellion WHICH IS TRUE but NOT the WHOLE TRUTH} but she shouldn\u2019t have been there! Canon wise it makes no sense for HER to be at Yavin!\nWhy shouldn\u2019t Mon Mothma have been at Yavin 4?\nBecause the Rebellion in that era was a Guerrilla Rebellion set up in CELLS so as to avoid the capture and turning of one Member giving away the WHOLE!\nBecause Mon Mothma was a Republic/Imperial Senator who STILL held her Senatorial seat during the time of A New Hope - She was hiding in plain sight! She was maintaining the entire Rebellion whilst sitting in meetings WITH THE EMPEROR!\nMon Mothma would NEVER HAVE RISKED going to Yavin 4! That was Bail Organa\u2019s Cell - Bail was a Republic/Imperial Senator himself and there would have been no need for Mon Mothma to go to Yavin 4 even AFTER Bail\u2019s death on Alderaan NEVER MIND BEFORE IT!\nYes the Emperor dissolved the Senate in A New Hope BUT this was clearly AFTER the debacle at Scarif NOT BEFORE IT! And even if Mon Mothma had got advance word the Emperor was going to do this she would not have been foolish enough to have shown herself to so many Rebels who could easily have identified her were they captured!\nBail\u2019s death left Mon Mothma as the single leader of the whole Rebellion BUT she didn\u2019t risk coming out into the open UNTIL Return of the Jedi 5 YEARS LATER!\nGeneral Jan Dodonna was in command at Yavin 4 - There was no need to push him aside - In A New Hope he CLEARLY defers to Leia anyway as she is the next in-line after her father BUT he still commands the Rebel Base and Fleet whilst she stands at his side!\nAt Hoth General Rieekan is the base commander who again CLEARLY defers to Leia as the Most Senior Civilian in that Cell at the time!\nAt Endor Leia decides to take a more ACTIVE role in the assault and we see the REAL LEADER of the Rebellion for the first time - That leader isn\u2019t Admiral Ackbar OR General Madine, It\u2019s Mon Mothma!\nWhy is Mon Mothma putting herself in danger at Endor? Because THIS IS IT! This is the last chance the Rebellion will have! The Rebel Fleet at Endor is EVERYTHING THEY CAN MUSTER! The Empire is winning, Mon Mothma has possibly already been compromised though this isn\u2019t specifically mentioned\u2026But even if she hasn\u2019t been, Losing at Endor will guarantee she is compromised sooner rather than later!\n-\n-\n-\nYou are NEVER going to please every Star Wars fan, Heck you\u2019re never going to please EVERY Star Trek fan either! Or EVERY fan of anything!\n-\n-\n-\nWhere Disney have gone wrong is in\u2026\n1) Trying to FORCE diversity! There\u2019s nothing wrong with diversity btw, Leia herself is a powerful figure for Feminism in the Original Trilogy! Lando\u2019s \u201cblackness\u201d is never mentioned, it\u2019s simply not an ISSUE! Which is how it should be btw!\n2) Deliberately ignoring the EU Legends Canon and Source Material!\n3) VANDALISING the Original Trilogy!\n4) Catering to the GENERIC MCU fan rather than actual Star Wars Fans! What do you want from Star Wars? Space Battles? Well you\u2019ve got them!\n5) Misusing Blatant \u201cFan-Service\u201d to get the \u201cfans\u201d onside - Lucas was also guilty of this when he added Boba Fett into Attack of the Clones! THIS NEVER WORKS!\n6) Writing bad characters! Finn, Rey, Kylo Ren, Snoke, Rose, Poe, Hux, Holdo etc. - These are all Stock Characters! They have zero or very little characterisation of their own! What characterisation they do have is cliched and weak!\n7) Copying the Original Trilogy! A lack of Imagination! And worse\u2026.Trying to One-Up the Original Trilogy!\n8) Putting in charge a woman who\u2019s blatantly Misandric! Kathleen Kennedy! Simply because that woman\u2019s whole career was made working at the side of Great men such as Spielberg, Lucas, Marshall, Dante and Zemeckis!\n9) Believing that JJ Abrams was able to take on an existing franchise and make decent movies - Star Trek should have shown them this wasn\u2019t going to happen!\n10) Putting Money ahead of Story!\n-\n-\n-\nAs to a \u201cReboot\u201d - It really depends on what they do with that Reboot.\nIf they decide to ADAPT Timothy Zahn\u2019s Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command AND DO IT WELL AND FAITHFULLY then I\u2019ll be ECSTATIC!", "I am fine with episodes 1 through 6 of The Skywalker Saga.\nStrange though I had never really thought of them as \u201cthe Skywalker Saga\u201d until the last 1\u20132 years when that term started to be bandied about.\nThose films told the tale of the rise of the Sith, Empire, and Anakin; and the fall of the Jedi, the Republic, and Anakin Skywalker.\nThat was a wrap!\nThe fan fiction that came after I\u2019m not concerned with.", "There is no need too, the fans don\u2019t want it, but nobody wanted a reboot of Star Trek, but they gave us one anyway.\nIf it was rebooted, at first fans would see it,some might even love it and prefer it to the original. It would make it\u2019s budget back and some internet top movie lists would place it at #1.\nWithin 3 years the reboot trilogy would be finished. Fans who paid to see it a few years ago would be foaming at the mouth for there hatred of the new series. Within 6 months the movies would all be considered the worst SW films ever made, and fans would find another streaming show to watch.\nLike the Kelvin timeline Star Trek films, they will be seen as a novelty by the true fans, everyone will have the Discs, and they will gather dust in the movie collection.", "I personally am fine with the way they are. I did not like the disney movies except for rise of skywalker. If they could reboot those and try and not kill of the original characters that would be great and maybe make a movie over Luke skywalker and how he grew so powerful and just seeing him raising up new jedi. Other then that I am completely fine with it.", "No. Just no.\nI\u2019d stop there, but I feel obliged to offer some explanation.\nWhile perhaps a reboot would fix some of the story-telling problems, Star Wars fans have abided by those issues ever since the original trilogy. And perhaps a reboot would offer even better special effects, but that has never been an issue either.\nThe greatest wrong that would be presented by doing a reboot would be casting. Harrison Ford is Han Solo. Carrie Fisher is Princess Leia. Mark Hamill is Luke Skywalker. Peter Cushing is Grand Moff Tarkin. Sure, Ewan McGregor could play old Obi-Wan and Donald Glover could play Lando Calrissian, but I wouldn\u2019t really want to replace Alec Guinness or Billy Dee Williams. Star Wars fans would grumble at great lengths about how a new cast failed to rise to the greatness of the originals.\nA reboot would be entertaining, but it would rankle fans for all its new shortcomings and flaws because, despite the best intentions of all involved, imperfections are surely inevitable.", "No.", "NO\nWhile there are some issue with the Episodes 1\u20136, they tell a straight forward story. Nothing needs rebooted.\nEpisodes 7, 8 and 9, IMO, are a dumpster fire dowsed with gasoline. Each movie, 7\u20139, has some good moments, but the rest seem to destroy everything Eps.1\u20136 set up.\nNo reboot necessary, but I would like to see Luke waking from a nightmare; hence, erasing Eps. 7\u20139.", "I think that idea would meet hatred and disgust mainly.", "Would a reboot of the Star Wars Skywalker Saga be appreciated by SW fans?\nI can't speak for any other fan but myself, but I would have zero interest in a reboot of the Skywalker Saga. Why, you ask?\nBecause at its core, the existing triple trilogy is a beautiful piece of storytelling. All three trilogies are flawed, of course, but that's been the case since Day One. It's a straightforward tale of corruption and redemption, of good and evil, and as a series, it has some of the most stunning visuals of my lifetime, if not all time. It doesn't require a great deal of thought to follow along, but at the same time, it draws you in so you ARE thinking about it long afterward.\nI've always been of the opinion that certain classics simply shouldn't be touched as remakes or reboots.

The nitration of cellulose-rich material (like the sawdust Tyler mentioned) also makes nitrocellulose which can stabilize his nitroglycerin to form dynamite (which he then used to blow up those credit card companies).\nHowever, his method of making such large quantities of nitroglycerin in the basement of an abandoned, dilapidated house on the outskirts of town, was far from safe. In the real world, that house would have been blown to smithereens and that would have been the end of Project Mayhem. Also, the movie never explains where Tyler got his constant supply of lye and nitric acid from. In the real world, he would have been reported as suspicious for purchasing nitric acid in bulk (since it\u2019s a known precursor for many dangerous explosives). Well, I suppose that maybe one of his Project Mayhem insiders convinced the proper authorities to overlook this.\nBut yes, the chemistry is real. The safety of the processes mentioned however, are not. So don\u2019t try this at home if that\u2019s what you\u2019re planning.", "Ehhhhh. More than you might think, but not so much that you could build a bomb by watching it. Making napalm out of gasoline and concentrated orange juice is, technically, true, but that\u2019s more trivial than it sounds. Napalm is just a term for any flammable liquid mixed with a gelling agent to make it stay together in a stream, when you spray it, and stick to surfaces and keep burning, instead of quickly evaporating in a fireball. Most napalm is either gasoline- or diesel-based. Orange juice (or any other sticky syrup for that matter) would probably work. Not as well as the professional stuff, but it would almost certainly both stick and burn.\nHis instructions on making explosives are, in fact, pretty much on point. Glycerin is a byproduct of traditional soapmaking, as it forms when fat is hydrolysed by lye. And it is the feedstock for nitroglycerin, which is the active ingredient in dynamite. Given that nitroglycerin was first produced in 1847, it should hardly be surprising that\u2019s it\u2019s production is fairly simple, by modern standards. That said, it should be pointed out that his descriptions are extremely crude and basic. Saying \u201cmix glycerin with nitric acid\u201d sounds simple. If you tried that in real life, you\u2019d probably either wind up with an inert mixture, or you\u2019d end up a stain on the wall. Doing it in real life (and not dying) requires understanding proportions, catalysts, reaction rates, exothermic heating, and what kinds of byproducts you\u2019d end up with. What he describes is a very basic outline of how dynamite is made, but not enough that you\u2019d want to proceed from that.\nHis black powder recipe is similarly stripped down. Yes, barium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur make black powder (though the much more accessible potassium or sodium nitrates have traditionally been used). That recipe has been around since the 9th century, and so is even less of a mystery. But even then, making a mixture that will actually explode requires quite a bit more technique than that.\nBut, yes. If you can mix fuel and an oxidizer, you can usually make a low explosive. If you can nitrate any of a dozen different compounds with fuming nitric acid, then you can make high explosives. Neither is a good idea, unless you have adequate safety equipment and training, but the concepts aren\u2019t all that hard."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "John Freiler", "view_list": [107, 772]}, "444": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Alae Ferzazi"], "question_title": "Have there been any Oscar-worthy Korean movies, excluding Parasite?", "topic_list": ["Korean Movies", "Academy Awards", "Korean Ethnicity and People", "Movie Lists", "Korean Peninsula", "Hollywood", "Movie Business and Industry", "Movie Recommendations", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "829", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["Oscars 2020: South Korea's Parasite makes history by winning best picture\nSouth Korean film Parasite has been named best picture at this year's Oscars, becoming the first non-English language film to take the top prize.\nRenee Zellweger won best actress for playing Judy Garland in Judy.

It is a film that ranked in my ten favorites for about a year of my life.\nBut slowly, as I continued my personal film education, Gladiator started to get worse and worse on each rerun. I couldn\u2019t really figure out why this is for a while, but this question has made me sure of it.\nGladiator has no point.\nYep, that\u2019s what it all comes down to. Gladiator is a film that is technically stunning; beautifully shot, exceptional action, great acting, and more, but is without subtext. It is a film that exists for a singular purpose: To entertain.\nYes, Maximus Decimus Meridius, I am entertained. But that\u2019s it.\nThat\u2019s the point and the only point. Is there a problem with that? No.\nBut does it make a masterpiece? Absolutely not.", "Gladiator was essentially a remake of the classic \u201cThe Fall of the Roman Empire\u201d, starring Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd, Alec Guinness, James Mason, Christopher Plummer, Mel Ferrer, and Omar Sharif, which was a much better movie in my opinion.\nThere\u2019s no real point to any movie, other than to make money for its investors. If it manages to entertain you, it\u2019s more likely to achieve that goal. Hollywood is not in the documentary business, and I have yet to see a historically accurate movie; when a film states that it\u2019s \u201cbased on historical events\u201d, take that with a large heaping of salt. At any rate, I would say, judge a movie by its entertainment value, whether you consider the sets, props, script, and actors live up to their billing. Don\u2019t go looking for anything deeper to avoid disappointment.", "The point is to demonstrate that one man when pushed can take down an empire through his own force of will and refusal to put his honour to one side. Also driving a man to vengeance is an error (kidnapping Maximus's family and holding them to ensure his compliance or even to get him to surrender for execution would have been the much better option).\nIt also demonstrates that Hollywood cares not a hot about historical accuracy. Not only has Commodus been joint Emperor with Aurelius for 3 years before Aurelius's death, not only was Aurelius not at all interested in restoring the Republic, not only did Commodus reign as emperor for 12 years on his own and fought along side Aurelius in his campaigns but he was eventually assassinated.\nHe was a bit of a nob though and did fight in the arena a lot and often.", "It\u2019s an old-skool Hollywood epic that deals with themes of personal character, revenge, and freedom. Crowe\u2019s character is made of the right stuff and so he manages to triumph, even when the odds are stacked against him. The Emperor is a spoiled brat who never had the right grounding in how to be a man, so his reign is marked by cruelty and decadence. It\u2019s also a great example of spectacle being alloyed with story, which is vanishingly rare these days.", "The same point of any hollywood summer blockbuster. To make oodles of money.\nThe more appropriate question I think is, are you trying to make a point with your question?\nAre you questioning deeper themes and history or making a passive attempt to criticize the film?", "What is not understandable to you was the reality of many men back then. I thought the movie was amazing from beginning to end.", "Not sure what you mean by \u201cpoint\u201d. The story is straightforward - Roman general becomes a slave, slave becomes gladiator, gladiator defeats emperor, becomes martyr. It's one of the greatest historical epics ever made.", "It was an attempt to remake the much better Fall Of The Roman Empire, from 1964, starring a young Christopher Plummer as Commodus and Steven Boyd as the structural equivalent of Russell Crowe\u2019s Maximus, named Galius Livius in the better film (regardless of IMDB\u2019s ratings), and Alex Guinness (before the Sir) as Marcus Aurelius instead of Richard Harris.\nUnfortunately, Fall Of The Roman Empire lost big bucks and the producer\u2019s Spanish studios, while Gladiator made big bucks.\nAs a point of irony, Richard Harris was going to play Commodus in the earlier film, but had \u201ccreative differences\u201d with the director and passed.", "I saw that film so long ago that I don't remember much of it any more.\nI recall it being a good exciting film and I liked it.\nI do not recall it having any kind of point other then entertainment.\nI usually look for a message,s metaphors and a parallel themes in films and books. I usually remember them but I don't recall any from this film.\nI think allot of the film was simply about adventure, bravery, ingenuity, politics, perseverance, personalities and the usual decadent and incestual stuff that you find in most Hollywood films about the Roman hierarchy..\nI do recall thinking that allot of the stone and marble architecture looked ancient and eroded. I think that was because it is what we are used to seeing.\nin reality the stone and marble architecture would have looked pretty well kept up, and almost brand new.\nThe other mistake that I think they made (as they always do in Hollywood films about Rome) is that all the statues are white. The reality is that the Roman\u2019s painted statues quite colorfully to the point of gaudy.\nif you liked Gladiator and you'd like to learn more about one of the most important periods of Roman history around the time of Julius Caesar and the fall of the Replublic. There is an excellent HBO series simply called ROME. It is on DVD.\nThe series is highly entertaining, very well produced and surprisingly accurate. There is feature on the DVDs that if you turn it on - descriptions of architecture, customs religion, politics etc. pop up. That makes for a great thrilling history lesson on top of all the intrigue.\nTake care and enjoy", "I\u2019ll not touch on the historical accuracy of the movie as that has been well answered. A couple of thoughts however. The movie was a great vehicle for Russel Crowe in his prime to show off his acting skills, yes he\u2019s egotistical ut he had the chops to back it up. It also proves that genres never die they just need to be well executed.\nFor me the heart of this movie is about being defined by our actions, standing up for what\u2019s right and also a meditation upon the after life. Through his actions Crowe\u2019s character redeems himself and is rewarded by reuniting with his family in death.", "I think the movie was just an excuse to get Russell Crowe slicing and dicing dudes in the Colosseum. That is my guess.\nI mean this history of the movie is totally off\nMarcus Aurelius did not pass up his son as heir for some random general. Commodus was made co-emperor with Marcus years before Marcus died\nCommodus is way nicer in the move than in real life. In reality he actually cared none for the empire or ruling it- his sole obsession was being a gladiator and he took great joy in killing things he found \u201cweird\u201d which meant disabled people- and he liked to kill them slow\nThere was never any attempt to rebuild the Republic. All of the emperors were proud autocrats and this never changed\nGladiators were like modern sports figures. Most gladiators in the movie have strange armor and weapons. This never actually happened. There were specific \u201ctypes\u201d of gladiators- like the strong type, the fast type, and archer type- and each had specific sets of weapons they always used.\nIt\u2019s a great movie and it does well in getting people interested in Rome though.

Nevertheless, their unconventional style gets the job done.\nAn unsympathetic character, while technically meaning a character that lacks sympathy, is often used to describe a character that has no redeeming qualities.", "Being against the heros??

Many places add a clarification to this such as \u201cNatural Life\u201d to clarify that it is their entire life.\nSometimes \u201cLife\u201d means an indefinite sentence, but could be for the rest of the person\u2019s entire life, but a parole board could choose to let them out earlier (on parole, or terminate their sentence early, even though they MIGHT serve their entire life there depending on the discretion of a parole board). So you are sentenced to prison for your entire life, but you have the possibility of being paroled. hundreds or thousands of people with these sentences are paroled from prison every year. It happens ALL the time.\nLife without Parole / Life without the Possibility of Parole = This means there is theoretically no chance a person should ever get out of prison. Having said that, there are cases of these people being released too. Obviously sometimes some of them are later found to be innocent. Sometimes they get their sentence overturned in some other way. Sometimes they receive a pardon or commutation (ie: from the president, governor, parole board, expungement, or whatever other legal channels the jurisdiction has). These are \u201cexceptions\u201d to the rule, but there are many cases of this. But in theory, if sentenced to Life without Parole, a person can pretty much feel absolutely confident they will die in prison, especially if they are really actually guilty. You probably have a better chance of winning the lottery.", "Don't believe anything in the movies no I don't understand what you mean by get out of life sentences some convicted felons to get a life sentence sidering what they were convicted of some convicted felons like me just get a regular sentence and want your time is done you leave.

A movie star, meanwhile, is an actor who has gained a high enough profile as an actor that they are recognized both by fans and the industry itself. Movie stars typically play leading roles in productions; not always, but usually. They play the heroes we cheer for and the villains we love to hate; when they announce the nominees for best actor and actress, those are typically established movie stars. Again not always, but often.\nActors, meanwhile, play all of the other roles in a given production, from the server bringing the lead actress coffee in a diner scene to the teeming throngs of extras we see in the background as a character walks the streets of a city or town. Extras, incidental characters, cameos, and many other roles that fill out any given scene without being the scene\u2019s primary focus are all played by actors. Sometimes movie stars will appear in cameo roles, if for no other reason than the film wanted to attach a high profile or recognized name to their film, but usually the roles with less screen time go to less well-known actors and not movie stars.\nIn short, all movie stars are actors but not all actors are movie stars.\nIdris Elba (Thor), Lupita Nyongo (Black Panther), Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump), Angelina Jolie (Maleficent), Oscar Isaac (Annihilation), and Meryl Streep (Postcards from the Edge) are all considered to be movie stars. They are actors and actresses who have been successful enough in the industry that they have become widely recognized by audiences, film studios, and film critics. They are often sought after for specific roles, studios seek them out for projects because their names alone can draw in audiences to see a film, their talents are often recognized at awards shows, and they have considerable filmographies representing decades of work in the industry.\nAs for actors who are not movie stars I would recommend checking out IMDb: Ratings, Reviews, and Where to Watch the Best Movies & TV Shows\nand looking up any film, recent or otherwise, and perusing the full cast list to see plenty of examples of actors who are not movie stars (yet\u2026 wink wink). It\u2019s also really fun to watch actors who begin playing small roles but who rise to prominence over time. David Dastmalchian is a great example. The first movie I saw him in was \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d in 2008; he played one of the Joker\u2019s thugs. He was only in two scenes and only had a few lines in that movie but he played the crap out of that role, lol! Then in 2015 I saw him again in \u201cAnt-man\u201d playing Kurt, one of the former robbers who was part of Antman\u2019s entourage. He had a more prominent role there, had many more lines of dialogue, and was again a joy to watch! Now he\u2019ll be playing Piter De Vries in the upcoming movie adaptation of the science fiction classic \u201cDune,\u201d one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time, and I can\u2019t wait to see what he brings to that part! He\u2019s not a movie star in the way that Oscar Isaac is, but he\u2019s a great actor and I\u2019ve enjoyed him in every role I\u2019ve seen him play thus far (his filmography is much larger than I\u2019m talking about here too, by the way; check it out!).\nThat\u2019s the long and the short of it, though. Movie stars are the most successful actors out there in terms of money they make and the recognition and celebrity status they enjoy. They are by no means the only talented actors out there, but they are definitely among the most fortunate.\nHope that helps!\nCheers!"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Camilo Jr Villanueva", "view_list": [249]}, "161": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Bhushan Doiphode"], "question_title": "What did you like in the Detective Conan Movie 23: The Fist of Blue Sapphire?", "topic_list": ["Detective Conan Movies", "Detective Conan (Japanese manga series)", "Case Closed (Manga series)", "Sapphires", "Anime", "Movies", "Survey Question"], "no_of_view": "281", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["Any movie or episode with kaitokid is a must watch tbh.. the story line wasn't that good tbh but the action scenes and animations is what i liked the most ohh and did i mention the bromance of kaito and conan lol..\nAnyways you can watch that movie on kissanime ..

Frozen is set around 1840, and Tarzan takes place around 1900.\nMore to the point, Tarzan is owned by the Edgar Rice Burroughs Estate; Disney paid for a license for that one movie, and it does not include the right to add to his family tree. There is no rational reason why the Walt Disney Company would tie one of their most popular and lucrative franchises into somebody else\u2019s most valuable property.\nI will refer you to the following posts at GeekDad for further explanation:\nNo, Tarzan Is Not Anna and Elsa's Little Brother. Here's Why - GeekDad\nWhen Did That Disney Movie Happen? (Updated) - GeekDad", "No, Anna and Elsa\u2019s parents died when their ship went down. The time lines also don\u2019t fit at all and the parents look nothing alike.\nIt\u2019s not even possible that Disney planned this even if it wasn\u2019t confirmed that their parents died. Tarzan came out in 1999, over 14 years before Frozen. If they were planning something like that then they wouldn\u2019t wait so long to release a movie that was supposed to be directly connected to Tarzan like that.\nAnother reason they obviously didn\u2019t plan anything like that is that Elsa wasn\u2019t originally Anna\u2019s sister, Anna wasn\u2019t originally supposed to be royalty so her parents weren\u2019t relevant to the story for a a while, and if they were planning on making Tarzan related to anyone it wouldn\u2019t be Anna, a random girl who fights the self proclaimed snow queen, and it wouldn\u2019t be Elsa, the person who was originally supposed to be the villain in Frozen. They would never plan to make him related to either of these characters because it makes no sense and there\u2019s no reason.\nFinal reason, the time periods don\u2019t match up. The first movie took place around 1840ish. Based on the style of clothes Jane and her father wore and the technology Tarzan takes place in the late 1800\u2019s or early 1900\u2019s. Anna and Elsa\u2019s parents would be way too old to even be alive by that point, not to mention look that young and have another child. That would mean they\u2019re about 95 years old plus or minus a few years, they were still alive and only over 50 years later building a house after the ship wreck, and they had another child at almost 100 years old.\nThere\u2019s no point where this theory ever really made sense and very few of the pieces can fit together. I know that a lot of people really want to connect all Disney movies but it\u2019s not possible to connect all these movies together and actually make sense of all of it.\nAlso for anyone wondering why I guessed they would be in their 90\u2019s, I\u2019m guessing they were probably 19 or 20 when they had Elsa. They died five years before the first movie actually takes place so they died around 1835 when Elsa was 16 so they would be roughly 36 in 1835. I was going on the earlier side of the guess as to when Tarzan took place so I was guessing 1895 so they would be an estimated 95ish at youngest.", "No. Definitely not. There was that bit of conjecture that Tarzan\u2019s English parents were also the Norwegian parents of Anna and Elsa based on vague similarities between images of their fathers (because Disney artists all kinda\u2019 draw the same), but that was definitively proven false by Frozen II. Anna and Elsa\u2019s parents were killed on their voyage to the north of Arendelle, not on their way south past Africa.", "No. That is utterly ridiculous.\nThere are two major issues with that theory. Taking them in order:\nTarzan is fairly easy to place geographically. Gorillas have a limited range, so we can safely place it along the western coast of Africa, just below the bulge that forms the western part of the Sahara desert. Frozen is clearly meant to take place in Scandinavia, and I would assume that it takes place in Sweden, given the relations Arendale apparently has with the Summer Isles (probably off the Spanish coast). If we are to assume Anna and Elsa\u2019s parents died on their way to Rapunzel\u2019s wedding (we can see her going to greet Elsa at her coronation), they were en route to Germany. Meaning they\u2019d have to have been in a storm that blew them from the North Sea to the Equator. Not likely.\nSecond, we ought to look at the technologies used in both films. Frozen is roughly medieval to renaissance; the characters use swords and bows to fight, and the fashions are an approximation of Nordic fashions of the time. Tarzan\u2019s villain uses a double barreled rifle to hunt, and seems wholly confident in its ability to dispatch gorillas and even elephants which he shows no fear of. The fashions and sailing ship they use to arrive in Africa further cement that Tarzan takes place in the late 1800s, probably the 1880s or 90s. Unless Tarzan took 400 years to grow up, then, he\u2019s not Elsa\u2019s baby brother.", "Yes.

They didn't accepted him at all from the beginning, because they feared him, so they didn't wanted him in the Jedi Order. None of them, after Jinn's death, even tried to understand his concern for his enslaved mother, and did not even try to helped him. The Jedi Order basically told him \"this doesn't concern us\" ...\nAnother source of conflict was his dwindling trust and increasing resentment toward the Jedi High Council, which he felt distrusted him and was not treating him with enough respect. These fears and resentments were further fomented by Palpatine's manipulations, and some of the Council's (and Kenobi's) decisions, as well as his friendship with Chancellor Palpatine, of whom the Council was wary and kept secrets from.\nSkywalker struggled to keep his emotions in check\u2014especially his anger. He cared deeply about his friends, and according to Ahsoka Tano, \"looked out for them until the end.\" Loyal to a fault, Skywalker was willing to do anything to protect those he cared about, often resorting to the dark side of the Force to do so. Throughout the Clone Wars (as Palpatine had planned), Skywalker's anger would push him ever closer to the dark side, but his fall was ultimately triggered by his fear of loss after experiencing visions of Amidala dying in childbirth and his desire to obtain enough power to save his loved ones. He would justify his immoral and ruthless actions as all being necessary to bring peace, justice and order to the galaxy.\n\"Anakin was angry about the Jedi\u2019s attempt to use him, but he had another reason to be angry. He believed that if he were a Jedi Master, he would have access to secret Jedi teachings that would make it possible for him to prevent Padm\u00e9\u2019s death.\"\n\u2014Darth Vader\nAnakin relentless determination was rivaled by none, except perhaps by that of his Padawan. In some aspects, his journey as a mentor to Tano allowed him to mature and become more responsible. His emotional balance, however, was disrupted by the High Council's decision to expel Tano, when she was suspected of treachery, and her subsequent decision not to return to the Order when invited back.\nUpon his conversion to the dark side, Skywalker's arrogant streak became even more prominent, and for a short time, he believed himself to be even more powerful than Palpatine. His impulsiveness and tendency to act in anger were both magnified as well; for instance, when he discovered that Kenobi had stowed away on his wife's ship when she came to Mustafar, he immediately assumed that she was conspiring with his former master and strangled her with the Force. Despite this, Vader did experience a significant level of regret for the decisions that he had made to save Amidala.\nHowever, all that changed following his defeat at Kenobi's hands. Having lost all that he had turned to the dark side to preserve, and having no other path, he fully embraced the dark side and became, in Palpatine's words, a \"true Sith.\" Consequently, he devoted himself fully to furthering the development of his relationship to the Force, and the expansion of his power. Both due to what Palpatine taught him about the relationship between Sith master and apprentice and his own personal tendencies, Vader in his early apprenticeship was completely devoted to the Emperor. However, as his power grew, and particularly after learning of his son's existence, this devotion dwindled considerably.\nOver the years Vader developed a new, more hardened and disciplined persona. He became utterly ruthless, virtually devoid of mercy, and was known to occasionally kill his own officers for their failures. Eventually, the identity of Vader in the Empire had arisen tales of a dark armored humanoid who served as the Emperor's most trusted enforcer and was considered to be the most feared individual in the Empire. Rumors circulated that he lived in a castle in a world of lava and that he wielded a red lightsaber, suggesting a connection to the Sith. The few who had interacted with him stated that they were unsure whether the individual behind the armor was a living person, a droid or a clone trooper. Many feared that if Vader were ever defeated, a number of duplicates would be activated in his place. The Sith Lord also had absolutely no qualms about using torture to accomplish his goals.\nConsidered to be the Empire's first terror weapon and noted to employ antiquated diction, he was tenacious and unstoppable, and made most Imperial naval officers uncomfortable. Contrary to the rocky relationships he had with most Imperial officers, his rapport with his stormtroopers mirrored in many ways his former persona's relationship to the Republic's clone troopers. In fact, his standing with the rank and file was such that it was known as far as Ryloth that the stormtrooper corps \"almost worshiped him.\" Part of his reputation was that he would normally be quiet (and thus his presence made for a good implied threat to others) whereas shows of passivity were not. Indeed, it was well known that he usually preferred to oversee operations personally, using action to block out any intruding feelings. He was frequently at odds with those who lacked faith in the Force, finding it \"disturbing\" or even blasphemous.\nVader often used pressurized meditation chambers that allowed him to remain without his helm\u2014the neural connection to his armor\u2014during which he felt the perpetual pain that Kenobi had inflicted on his flesh. During such sessions, he would meditate to use this pain to feed his hate, which in turn fed his strength.\nVADER COMPLETED HIS MEDITATION and opened his eyes. His pale, flame-savaged face stared back at him from out of the reflective black surface of his pressurized meditation chamber. Without the neural connection to his armor, he was conscious of the stumps of his legs, the ruin of his arm, the perpetual pain in his flesh. He welcomed it. Pain fed his hate, and hate fed his strength. Once, as a Jedi, he had meditated to find peace. Now he meditated to sharpen the edges of his anger.\nHe stared at his reflection a long time. His injuries had deformed his body, left it a ruin, but they\u2019d perfected his spirit, strengthening his connection to the Force. Suffering had birthed insight.\n-- Lords Of The Sith\nClaiming not to feel regret, and yet haunted by his past, and the screams of his wife, he was determined to never talk about his old life, and detested all that reminded him of his past self (whom he deemed to be weak). He dared not remember such a period of his life, which he hated; indeed, through the use of the dark side, he kept his memories as Anakin Skywalker buried, although it took great effort even after twenty years of practice. Although he retained access to Skywalker's memories and experience, this burial was such that he refused to even think of Skywalker as himself, referring to internally to Skywalker's memories as those of \"The Jedi.\" However, his rapport with the stormtroopers who supported him, and the technique he displayed in wielding his crimson lightsaber, gave him away.\nThis is actually what he thought about all of that, recorded by Darth Vader in an holographic log :\n\u201cOnce, I was Anakin Skywalker. Anakin Skywalker was a weak and sentimental slave. He grew into a weak man who was betrayed by those he held closest\u2014 those he fought to keep safe. The Republic betrayed me even before I was born, by allowing slavery to flourish in the Outer Rim. The Jedi Order betrayed me when I was a child, leaving my mother in slavery and seeking to limit my power because of jealousy and fear.\nThe worthless peasants who took in my mother betrayed both of us by allowing her to be captured, tormented, and then killed. But the Jedi betrayed all of us\u2014 my apprentice, myself, and, ultimately, the citizens of the galaxy that they claimed to serve. The Jedi were cowards. They denied me the title of Jedi Master. They asked me to spy on the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. They told me to stand aside while they tried to murder him. And then my former master betrayed me. Too cowardly to kill me, he left me to die in agony.\nBut I did not die in the fires of Mustafar. Anakin Skywalker died that day. My weak and sentimental former self was finally destroyed. But I lived. I lived because I had opened myself to all the Jedi tried to deny: passion and emotion, which the Jedi forbade because they confused indifference to the suffering of others with peace.\nFrom passion and emotion I gained strength and power. Those are the lessons of the Sith\u2014 the importance of struggling and striving. Anger and pain are natural and part of growth. They give you focus. They make you strong. My Sith master Darth Sidious has betrayed me, too. But this is as it must be. The Jedi betrayed Anakin Skywalker to keep him weak; my Sith master betrays me to teach me strength. And I am strong. My armor hides the ruined body of Anakin Skywalker. But to the Force we are not such crude matter. The fires of Mustafar purified me, and in the Force I burn brightly. Anakin Skywalker is dead. But Darth Vader is alive.\u201d\n\u2014Darth Vader", "It's not that he actually hated them. He just felt they were holding him back for no reason.

It just never crossed my mind that wizards did that. I guess I was just naive on that one. To this day I still can't picture him with tattoos.\nMichael Gambon\u2019s representation of Dumbledore is a bit\u2026 theatrical? Dumbledore is more mellow in the books, and sometimes with a bit of onset dementia - like how he rambles at his feast speeches and starts telling jokes that aren't funny and McGonagall has to bring him back to reality. In the movies, there's no inkling of that part of his personality.\nThey made both Sirius, Lupin and Snape more likeable in the movies I think. In the 5th book, Sirius gets really snappy and mean at Harry sometimes (which is because he can't leave the house and feels powerless) and we don't get to see that. Lupin never gets the scene where he plans to abandon his family AFTER he gets married and gets his wife pregnant. And I feel like Snape is worse in the books than it was portrayed in the movies. Also, Sirius and Lupin never get to talk to Harry about his parents in the movies, which I think it's a missed bonding opportunity.\nHermione is portrayed as this really good and wholesome person. She's not that at all. She made Lavender cry because she had to win an argument and permanently scarred a 15/16 year old girl. But the movies won't talk about that.\nGinny\u2026 I mean, the movies did her dirty. That's all I'll say. That girl has a personality beyond being a love interest and no one creating those movies seemed to care.\nPlot wise:\nIt would've been great to see the trio and Ginny watch Neville visit his parents at the hospital.\nTo have Harry learn about his parents from their friends (Lupin and Sirius).\nTo see the paintings Luna did in her room of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville, and wrote friends connecting them all.\nTo see Lupin tell Harry that he'll be Teddy's godfather.\nTo see Harry give his Triwizard money prize to Fred and George for them to start their joke shop.\nTo give, even if just a flashback, of Regulus Black at the cave. Because, that man was a hero as well.\nTo show that Fred died smiling after making peace with his brother and surrounded by family and friends. And not just his corpse after the fact. He deserves better.\nTo show Kreature and the other house elfs join the fight.\nTo show some Slytherin students fighting for Hogwarts as well with Slughorn. They too deserve better than to be known as the \u201cevil house\u201d. Yes, some of them ran and some were evil. But also, some were brave.\nSo many things\u2026\nBut you kind of have to forgive and forget because, no matter how good a movie is, it'll never have as much detail or be as good as the book it was based on.", "Which change from the Harry Potter books to the movie adaptations upsets you the most?\nEssentially, it was the removal of a few characters from the films. Peeves was removed completely from the films and Dobby was removed from GoF and OotP. Obviously there was more characters that did things in the books that had their parts given to others (such as Hermione explaining what a mudblood was instead of Ron. Dobby \u201cdiscovering\u201d the room of requirement and giving Harry the gillyweed was given to Neville.)", "The change that upset me the most is Hermione stealing Ron's line about what the word \u201cMudblood\u201d means in Chamber of Secrets.

There\u2019s never any talk among the characters about the incident so it might as well as not have taken place. The time spent on that scene could have been spent on other aspects of the book that were omitted from the movie.", "PEEVES !!!!\nPeeves was an iconic character in the HP series and his omission from the movies troubled me a lot.\nEspecially the scene where Fred and George are leaving school.

His aggression and emotions that sealed the movie for me would remain unforgettable.\nI can never forget his suppressed emotions in Madari.

He never depended on those things. He was a real actor. He knew his job was acting and he did that perfectly.

The most memorable among them were Maqbool, D Day, Paan Singh Tomar, Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster.\nMost of them had Irrfan Khan.\nAnd thus gave me lot of memories during one of the important phases of my life.\nFootnotes\n[1] Irrfan Khan on his painful battle with cancer", "People often ask \u201cWhy do we mourn the death of celebrities? They are strangers. People die all the time.\u201d\nUnfortunately, that is true. People die all the time. Today, tragically and regrettably, Irrfan Khan is one of those people. But Irrfan wasn\u2019t a mere \u2018celebrity.\u2019 No.\nHis calling in life is the answer to the aforementioned questioned, and it is the reason I write this piece with a heavy heart \u2013 he was an artist.\nAnd with every artist lost, the world becomes a worse place. Art speaks to us in distinctive forms and languages. But once we find a piece of art or an artist that speaks to us, it is an enchanting moment. It moves you; it becomes a part of you. It is beautiful.\nTo me, Irrfan Khan was one such artist. As a performer, he was restrained, subtle, nuanced and perhaps most tellingly, effortless.\nHis graceful presence on screen was akin to a gazelle; nimble and malleable.\nWhether it was an emotionally encumbering dramatic sequence or light-hearted comic shenanigans, Irrfan\u2019s performances were always natural, authentic and lived-in.\nAt times, he made the craft of acting appear remarkably simple. He was one of the best. An actor of the highest caliber.\nIrrfan\u2019s grace and humility as a performer translated into life as well. Over the years, he came across as a calm, collected, intelligent, self-aware and thoughtful individual.\nHis demise at the age of 53 is lamentable.\nBut the lives of artists, much like art, are free from the shackles of time and death. They live on through their art. And Irfan Khan has left behind a positively glorious artistic canvas, one which will be cherished and lauded for generations to come.\nHe is immortalised on screen, through the medium he so deeply cherished.\nWhat are we to do then? There is not much we can do. I\u2019m going to dip into Irrfan\u2019s magnificent filmography \u2013 starting with Piku (2015), one of the finest Bollywood offerings of the previous decade.\nAnd what I will see is an actor with consummate command over his craft. A performer who lives and breathes his characters.\nIrrfan Khan made the art form of cinema a little bit better with his presence. There was, and always will be, a light coming off of him. And I will catch some of that light today, and for many days to come.\nFarewell, Irrfan. You will be missed. Now and always.\n\u201cI suppose in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go, but what always hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.\u201d", "Lazy afternoon\u2026I was watching Angrezi Medium.

I was shocked and checked the news and it turned out to be true. It was only yesterday when I read the news that his he was rushed to the hospital, after his condition was serious. I prayed that he would get well soon, but today amidst the news of coronavirus, this news made me sad. The year couldn't get any worse. What made it even worse that Irfan Khan had just lost his mother 5 days ago, and couldn't even see her last time due to the lockdown, that is currently in India. It was only few days ago, that I saw his new and sadly last movie, Angrezi Medium.\nIrfan Khan was not like any other bollywood actor, he was a maestro. His acting skills were par excellence and his iconic roles in will be remembered till the end of time. Being an outsider with no connection, he struggled a lot. He did a lot of small roles on television too. He was not only admired and respected as an actor in India, but was respected by many people in Hollywood too. Apparently Christopher Nolan wanted to cast him in the lead role of his masterpiece Interstellar, but that didn't happen. He made India proud with his art and talent. A national award winner, and a Padma Shri winner, he will go down as the finest actor to have ever graced in Indian cinema.\nRest in peace \ud83d\udc94, legend.

He made his last onscreen appearance in Homi Adjania directorial Angrezi Medium and won hearts with his honest portrayal of a father who can go to any lengths to fulfil her daughter's dream.\nOne of the finest talents of Indian cinema, Irrfan Khan was honoured with the Padma Shri award, the fourth highest civilian award in 2011. His role in biographical drama Paan Singh Tomar garnered him the National Award for Best Actor. Apart from this, he won several awards for his movies like Maqbool, Life In A Metro, The Lunchbox and others.\nFor Irrfan, cinema and acting meant, \"stories (that needed) to be told, moments to be lived, memories to be with you and immaterial of material things.\"\nMAY HIS SOUL REST IN PEACE IN HEAVEN", "I was having my lunch after completing my tasks and a notification from Inshorts shook me to the core;\nI couldn't believe that Irrfan Khan is no more there was news of him being admitted to hospital yesterday and I was hoping it was just something minor but all my assumptions were wrong.\nI have seen almost all major works of Irrfan Khan including his only Telugu movie till date titled Sainikudu.\nHis rise from doing small roles in Indian Television shows to playing leading characters Hollywood movies has been commendable.\nI remember watching a mediocre movie titled Thank You some years back. The movie was of comedy genre it also had Akshay Kumar but the man whose expression were hilarious as well as convincing was only Irrfan.\nI also remember his works in serious movies like Paan Singh Tomar, Maqbool and Madaari.\nThe man has carved a niche' for himself with his unique dialect of speaking dialogues.\nI hope Irrfan Sir's soul rests in peace.\nOm Shanti!\nFOOTNOTES :-\nIrrfan Khan filmography - Wikipedia", "I was convinced that this is fake news after my first Google search of it an hour ago.\nI was not willing to listen until the news went viral, only then was i convinced of his death.

But Irrfan Khan.. i consider him an Asset, an invaluable one at that.\nBollywood has a load of variety of stars, but not one compared to Irrfan sir.

I was still hoping desperately that he would recover. And then the update from this cursed morning hit like a ton of bricks.\nIrrfan Khan was an oddity. An actor par excellence. Diametrically opposite to the usual Bollywood hero stereotype, he did not have a legion of fans swooning about his looks or his machismo. People didn\u2019t congregate about his residence hoping to catch a glimpse of him. He was not a star-kid, born with a proverbial silver spoon. He was pure talent, through and through.\nThe wife and I binged three of his movies a couple of weeks back \u2014 his latest release Angrezi Medium where he portrays a father who\u2019d go to any length to make his daughter\u2019s dream come true, Qarib Qarib Single where he plays a charismatic, flamboyant, yet relatable middle-aged man whose idea of love seemed both silly and right at the same time, and Karwaan where he played the part of a supporting character seamlessly, providing the perfect amount of comedic relief and relatability.\nI have loved almost every one of his movies, with Lunchbox being the one closest to my heart. He is one of the very few actors in Bollywood I truly admire. His versatility shown through his filmography from Haider to Piku, from Paan Singh Tomar to D-Day, from Hindi Medium to Maqbool.\nRIP Khan Sahib.

Premiering just after FDR\u2019s inauguration, the Depression was just beginning to show its worst, as women and children hit the road in large numbers of hungry and homeless.\nPure escapism reigned. Kong took patrons on an exotic adventure, using images not seen before. Willis O\u2019Brien\u2019s stop-action animation, achieved by painstakingly moving models and shooting one frame at a time, was refined immeasurably on this film. His The Lost World (1926) had nothing as exciting as Kong\u2019s battles with a t-Rex and a pterodactyl.\nLines stretched around Radio City Music Hall day and night, all during spring and summer. Kong saved RKO Radio studios, all by itself. A sequel became desirable.\nThe Kong project began when Merian C. Cooper wrote the adventure novel it was based on in 1932. It\u2019s a breezy read. Then it was determined that some of the settings might serve for more than one film; Joel McCrea and Fay Wray were shooting The Most Dangerous game, also set on a remote island, elsewhere on RKO\u2019s lot.\nSo it was decided that for Carl Denham\u2019s return to skull Island, they could reuse sets and interiors from Dangerous Game. All that remained was for O\u2019Brien and model-builder Marcel Delgado to create another star; using a diminutive Kong would save time.\nWith a sequel plot one might think up over lunch, and various other shortcuts, Cooper and Ernest B.

Then Art house movies will be of limited or low budgeted and limited to festivals and art houses, they scrape through to cover the investment made, but they are happy,satisfied that of making a notable movie, thirdly aspiring film makers struggle to get funds and to make a entry in to the commercial movie arena, and get entries in to film festivals eyeing awards, and buyers, and release, they may or may not get back the investments, lastly who want to have thrill of movie making, they are not bothered about the money put in which are invariably by their and their associates savings, even though it may be a handsome amount, are written off. Now coming to releasing a movie on line, as there is no set of system is there to charge or a ticketing system to collect the money, so that the investment made recovered, forget profits.Now you decide what kind of movie you are thinking, and how to release. though there is a Pay per View, is there,it is not as simple to attract viewers to log in, unless it is BLOCK BUSTER people will not be ready to subscribe to pay per view.", "Thanks for A2A,\nIndeed there are certain movies which has to be experienced from the theatres, like \u201cBahubali\u201d or \u201cTitanic\u201d for instance.

Honestly, 95% of movies falls under that category..for such movies online movies are God send opportunities..\nRather than playing for a day or even a couple of shows they can be listed on some OTT platforms and they can try their luck in getting some views..even that can't be sure as many viewers doesn't like to waste couple of hours in their life!\nOrganisation of the film Industry can form a screening committee to find out whether a movie has certain level of Quality which will make the audience to spend their money and time for it in theatres, if it qualifies then first it should be premiered on theatres else directly towards streaming..\nI think this would be the need of the hour..", "As I don't understand the business metrics properly, I can state the figures and prove my point here but I see a good deal happening there. Medium budget movies that may or may not see the day of the light at the big screens, owing to various factors like lack of theatres or distributors, this medium is a safe place to release the movie. OTT pays them a decent amount to bag the streaming rights. There is an elite audience for theatres, but for digital releases, everyone becomes one.

Having made his debut in K.Balachander directed Pattina Pravesam in 1976, he had acted in more than 100 movies in supporting character roles and has won acclaim for many of his performances. He was also a quasi-regular in many of Kamal Haasan films, right from the Raja Parvai days, and in my opinion, his best ever performance, with or without Kamal Haasan was his role as the scheming Sethurama Iyer, secretary to Gemini Ganesan inthat 1996 classic Avvai Shanmugi. With a trade mark jasmine string permanently dangling from his ear, Delhi Ganesh had a running role in the film and had combination scenes with every one in the ensemble cast. The sequence where he tries to tail Avvai Shanmugi (Kamal Haasan) with disastrous results, and the one in which he tries to get the Muslim bhai Nasser masquerading as brahmin cook to recite gayathri to test him are two stand out performances which would have made any seasoned full time comedian proud.\nDelhi Ganesh\u2019s performance in Avvai Shanmugi was so spontaneous and refreshing that even Om Puri, unarguably one of the very best actors of Indian cinema, could not reproduce the magic while reprising this role in Hindi Chachi-420. Such was the form of Delhi Ganesh in this film.\nPS : Whilst on Delhi Ganesh, I would like to add one more unrelated facet of his dedication to his portrayal of his roles. Actors like Delhi Ganesh seldom get some chance to sing in any film. On one such rare occasion when in the Rajinikanth movie Raghavendrar he gets to sing a few lines as part of a song, see how meticulous his lip-sync was to the singing:\n(Watch the video for few seconds from the third minute to see how Delhi Ganesh lip syncs for a song)\nImages/videos from internet.\nThanks for reading.", "It is Avvai shanmugi \u2018s Sethus role."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Lakshmi Narasimhan R", "view_list": [422, 596, 2]}, "184": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Mukesh Verma"], "question_title": "What are some of the unknown facts of the late Bollywood actor Irrfan Khan?", "topic_list": ["Irrfan Khan (actor)", "Indian Actors and Actresses", "Cinema of India", "Bollywood Actors and Actresses", "Bollywood Movies", "Bollywood", "Actors and Actresses", "Movies", "India"], "no_of_view": "771", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["A very talented actor, Irrfan Khan passed away today at the Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital in Mumbai because of colon infection.

After appearing in the Telugu film, Malliswari (2004), Kaif earned commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? (2005) and Namastey London (2007). She followed with a series of box-office hits but was criticized for her acting, repetitive roles, and inclination to male-dominated films.\nKaif's performance in the terrorism drama New York (2009) was better received, earning her a Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination. After starring roles in Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009), Raajneeti (2010) and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011), she received her second Filmfare nomination for her performance in Mere Brother Ki Dulhan (2011). Kaif's highest-grossing films came with the action thrillers Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dhoom 3 (2013), and Bang Bang! (2014), all of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films. She followed this with roles in a series of films that did not perform well commercially, with the exception of the action sequel Tiger Zinda Hai (2017) and the drama Bharat (2019), but received praise for playing an alcoholic actress in the romantic drama Zero (2018), for which she received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n(source: Google)\nThanks for Reading\nUpvote if you agree with my answer.

Not only has he acted in huge blockbusters but also challenged his limits ans range as an actor and taking on really terrific, different & memorable roles in artsy and indie films. Movies like Maqbool, Haasil, The Lunchbox, Life in a metro, Paan Singh Tomar & The Namesake come to mind. He had this aura, charismatic appeal & essence about him that just instantaneously captured the cinema-goer's attention with just his subtle facial expressions alone.\nWhat really elevated his range as an actor was his work in foreign films. Considering the fact that most Bollywood stars avoid working in foreign films because there they would have to audition like everyone else and would have to leave their giant egos and superstar status aside to work. But not Irrfan. He had to start like everyone else with small & supporting roles. But it was only a matter of time before he earned a reputation among foreign audiences and critics alike. And it was that reputation that got him roles in big budget Hollywood films like Slumdog Millionaire, Life of Pi & Jurassic World. In fact one of my favorite film critics Chris Stuckmann in his review for 'The Amazing Spiderman' (2012) said he was really disappointed with such a small inconsequential role Irrfan was given considering what an actor he is and what a huge deal he was over here. You ask any other foreign film critic which Indian actor comes to mind and they'll always say Irrfan Khan. And despite acting in so many films, it was his genuine humbleness as a person that struck me the most. He never behaved like a star, but rather just like an ordinary actor.\nReally sad and shocked to hear of his tragic demise. What was even more saddening that his mother had just passed away a few days ago. I can only imagine what his family is going through and may God give them the strength they need to deal with this.\nTo conclude, India has produced its finest actors ever. A huge loss for the film industry and for our country.", "Image source: Instagram\nI can sum up his greatness as an actor in few lines.\nHe was offered as lead role in famous Christopher Nolan's hollywood movie Interstellar as Dr. Cooper.

I wanted to be here for The Lunchbox and D-Day. They couldn\u2019t allow that. I don\u2019t have a tendency to regret what I do, but knowing it's a Christopher Nolan film, I can say that this has been one of the most difficult decisions I\u2019ve made.\u201d\nCredits: times of India"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Dipanshu Gehlot", "view_list": [198, 426]}, "423": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Mark Timko"], "question_title": "Who thought Marco Robbin was the best acting force in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood?", "topic_list": ["Once Upon a Time (TV series)", "Television Actors and Actresses", "Acting", "Entertainment", "Hollywood", "Actors and Actresses", "Television Series", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "481", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["Did he play Brad Pit?"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Peter Mitchell", "view_list": [7]}, "460": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["James McLean"], "question_title": "Which abysmally depicted city in a movie is actually a very nice place to visit?", "topic_list": ["Film Locations", "Vacations", "Movie Story and Plot Themes", "Movie Production", "Movie Recommendations", "Cities and Metropolitan Areas", "International Travel", "Tourism", "Visiting and Travel", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "564", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [1], "ans_list": ["Ooooh, that's easy.

At least, the original Ripley is not. The person that identifies as Ripley in Alien Resurrection is a clone of Ripley and she contains a certain amount of Xenomorph DNA.\nThis is one of the few good parts of this movie. First, you find out something many fans of the series already guessed at. Xenomorphs are not just alien creatures that gestate inside hosts. When the \u201cFace hugger\u201d inseminates the host, it acts like a virus infecting most the cells in the host\u2019s body. This causes a Xenomorph embryo to grow inside the host from infected host tissue. And this embryo contains both Xenomorph and the host\u2019s DNA. Thus every host is closely related to the Xenomorph that eventually burst out of them. And this allows the Xenomorph to easily adapt to different environments because it also has some of the physical traits taken from the host\u2019s genome. And since Face hugger insemination work like a virus, clones from the tissue of infected hosts will develop with Xenomorph embryos inside them as well. That\u2019s where the Ripley clone comes in.\nWith some tissue from the original infected Ripley, future scientists attempted to clone Ripley in order to harvest a living Xenomorph. But this plan was plagued with failure.

Especially as to why he did it so late in the video game. Why kill Micah now, some 8 years after your protog\u00e9, right hand man and so many others were killed. Why kill Micah now, when after all, he\u2019s almost completely won?\nI mean, he tricked the feds into taking down the Van Der Linde gang by adding pressure onto to them. Granted, it was only until after Chapter 5 that he did this, but still.\nHe took the entirety of the Van Der Linde gang down by sowing the seeds of discourse and distrust. He killed Arthur Morgan.\nWhy kill him now? Just let John do it?\nWell, one idea I\u2019ve heard be thrown around is that in his old age, in seeing John there with the intent of killing Micah. In thinking back of what happened so many years ago, he sees the events with clarity, and realizes it was indeed Micah who was the rat. And maybe this train of thought makes him wonder if Micah again is leading him down this path where Federal Agents are waiting for him.\nAnother idea I\u2019ve heard is that he was initially going to take the money that is in the little shack behind Dutch and was planning to kill Micah to take it. But, realizing that John needed it more to support his growing family, he left it and shot Micah. This seems unlikely to me though, as Dutch didn\u2019t seem to care all that much about Jack, John Marston\u2019s son, back in Chapter 6.\nA final theory I have to put out before I state my own beliefs as to why what transpired on that mountaintop happened.\nIt\u2019s obvious that Dutch is crazy, incredibly. He loses his mind and starts making actions that seem abhorrent throughout the game. Some have even started to diagnose Dutch with a plethora of mental illnesses in order to better understand why he acts the way he acts. One of which that stands out is bipolar disorder that is triggered due to the high-stress nature of the gang\u2019s final days and of one particular incident\u2026\nIt\u2019s on this mission that Dutch hit\u2019s his head, presumably hard, in a trolley accident whilst attempting to flee local authorities in San Denis.\nVictims of TBI, or Traumatic Brain Injury are 65% more likely of developing schizophrenia, 59% more likely to develop depression and 28% more likely of developing bipolar disorder, according to Traumatic Brain Injury: The Invisible Illness\nNow onto my theory.\nSomething to keep in mind, as I re-watch this cutscene for American Venom, there is this interesting discourse.\nJohn: What are you doing here, Dutch?\nDutch: Same as you, I suppose.\nNow it\u2019s incredibly clear at this point in the cutscene, as there was just a shoot out between Micah and John, a scuffle with Micah and Sadie Adler, and now a three-way standoff between Micah, John and Dutch that John is here to kill Micah. This is not a \u2018social call\u2019 as Micah sarcastically puts it.\nJohn is here for blood.\nDutch MUST know that, yet he says he is here for the same reason as John is, but then goes onto argue with Marston, claiming he betrayed him.\nTheorizing that he knows Micah betrayed him, as he does turn his back on Micah when Arthur dies in the good ending, Dutch probably came up there to kill Micah. Be it for greed, be it for revenge, be it for worry that he might sell him out once more, Dutch indeed intends to kill Micah.\nHe got all he could out of Micah. From what I understand they pulled a few more scores during their time together and I guess Dutch wanted out of that relationship. Before Micah did the same to him?\nBut then John shows up to kill Micah, and it goes badly. Dutch appears, and, perhaps feeling some bit of hesitation in killing John, just shoots Micah as he came to do. And then he leaves.\nHe leaves because on top of feeling uncomfortable, there, right in front of him is a representation, a reminder of the past. Of who he was. Arguably a good man. A good man who was corrupted by that rat, one who led many people, including his partner Hosea, and his son Arthur to their deaths.\nAnd Dutch didn\u2019t have the strength to face it.\nSo he left.", "If I remember Micah was the traitor."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Cozma Dan Claudiu", "view_list": [0, 22]}, "917": {"no_of_follower": 2, "respond_collected": 3, "name_list": ["Gene Bivins", "Veronica Ribeiro-Accouche", "Tom Salinsky"], "question_title": "Can an actor or actress be nominated for an Academy Award twice in the same category for two different movies?", "topic_list": ["Academy Awards", "Honors and Recognition", "Acting", "Actors and Actresses", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "776", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0], "ans_list": ["The answer is, not any more.

But I'll give you the flat-out answer right off the bat. No you cannot put Netflix shows on your site as a matter of fact Netflix can't even show all of Netflix shows on their own sorry because of Licensing and Regional agreements with the companies that own the the copyright and leasing agreements of a particular property.\nThat may sound weird or may not make sense so let me put it to you this way first of all how do you say Netflix gets all their second run shows full seasons at a time there are on the original Network and then Netflix releases them for a. Of time that's why they're still the Netflix MCU even though they cancel two of those shows two two of the four have four seasons in to have two seasons personally I feel three should have had four seasons in one should have never had a season at all but then you wouldn't have had Defenders to come in and fill the final Gap. Now that was a Marvel product under the license ship of the MCU brand and they still have that license shift if you do a search and type in Marvel the Netflix collection and it's the Marvel Netflix shows they did what year were checking out just for the fun anyway. Here's what most people don't know and why unless you have the same amount of money that Netflix does you can't put their shows on your website legally. I'm not sure what country you live in which is not really relevant with the exception that CBS All Access before it's actual announcement was obviously going to be a u.s. distributed Broadcasting format and Netflix has what we just called Netflix here in the US there's also Netflix UK and I believe Netflix I don't know what you would call Germany Dutch boy H I don't know I'm not I'm not trying to offend anyone anyway the point is I know they dub anime in German on Netflix for German Netflix subscribers now okay I'm off subject here's where your money's come again to be a factor CVS one and let me start a new paragraph.\nCBS wanted to re-establish something to do with its possessional rides of the Star Trek franchise as far as television goes considering Paramount owns movie rights, and actually that seems to be a not too far off merger and itself, now CVS is also like hey Star Trek is so popular over the years and everybody doing the streaming platform thing let's do our own and have our primary attraction being the next biggest Star Trek thing yet okay you got to realize this was probably three or four years ago since season 1 and 2 of already aired and we're waiting on three and a very poor card. Well Netflix caught wind of this, and offered CBS a deal MacArthur CVS did not intend on providing overseas broadcasting of any of its streaming series and Netflix had already set up by the end of season 1 literally you can read my full article somewhere else 130 countries worldwide. Netflix execs went to CBS Executives and said hey if you're going to put Star Trek and by this time it was known as discovery on your all access streaming paid platform to all your Regional consumers other words to u.s. possibly Canada I don't know and I really don't know anything about anything below Texas but what Netflix said was if you're going to do that how about Netflix pays for the entire production of the first whole season of Star Trek discovery for you if you allow us to broadcast it anywhere outside of your service area and CVS says hey wait do you want to pay for this thousands of dollars billions of hundreds of millions of work hours show that you can only are anywhere we don't Eric and Netflix is like yes CVS said okay Netflix if you pay for the production of the first season of Star Trek discovery you can have the licensing rights to broadcast it on Netflix UK and what other you know where ever else Netflix is outside of the US. but of course Alex Kirkman I'm sure it was the one had to jump in and say there's only one thing we are streaming this as a weekly broadcast here in the US so if we make this deal and you pay for the production of the first season you will be allowed to are each episode but only on a weekly basis and only one week after it airs on our streaming platform in the US. Solar words Germany can't VPN CVS in watch Star Trek early like I did accept the other way around course they all figured that out now spring how to block it and Netflix said okay we're cool with that. So as it turns out I just happened to be like one of those people that actually looks at all the tabs on my web pages and apps and there's one that says account and it's right under settings on your menu and it takes you directly to your actual Netflix web page an account information has lots of useful information lots of Community Information like you know when I said community of me like forums like me of groups of people that are doing like I'm doing because this is the only place I do this I mean talk up online people but if you go there latest news newest releases what's going to leave soon all that kind of news is there for everybody but for some reason is since I guess I am the only one that seems to pay attention to that button that says account I actually got to read that stuff well the week after the airing globally of the final episode of Star Trek discovery Netflix announced its acquisition of servicing its streaming platform to 130 countries worldwide so some people say Discovery was horrible some people love it may I just love space. But the bottom line is if you keep up with your Netflix news just don't mean on your own website I mean you open the app and you're watching the stuff you might as well go look around. But after the season finale and all the numbers came in Netflix had a major announcement on their webpage you know I don't remember if it was a blog or if it was tied to whatever doesn't matter the point was with the final episode of season 1 of Star Trek Discovery Netflix had officially distributed its streaming platform service to 130 countries I haven't really cared or looked at any other company that well other. I mean Disney obviously would be in there but I mean other than that I don't really care I just happened to notice that because I have already known that Netflix paid for the show and yes their MCU attempt was failing and there were dropping shows but they were also gaining more shows and also picking up what is considered Netflix original anime and, Netflix original series and these things aren't necessarily originally on Netflix Netflix has purchased the full rights to these shows for example one show that was on NBC called Lucifer had three very good Seasons but for some reason was canceled or and bought out by Netflix and they are de season 4 hey you know well I didn't are they filmed it created it corrected it paid for it and put season 4 out this is called a Netflix original mount at one time Netflix originals meant that there Studios produce TV shows I can't remember the name of the first one but it would start with an h and it was supposed to be scary as a howling or something I don't know it was weird it had a werewolf and vampires and snakes eating their own tell American Horror Story or something anyway enough for me you now know the story is Star Trek Netflix and why unless you're going to pay Netflix to lease their content and aired on your site then it's not legal just like I make amvs not so animated music videos I've made well over 60 51309 first-place Awards but oh and that's from PG-13 and below cuz I'm hearing them at anime conventions but I'm not profiting from them I am still still in the front of me and it's still I get letters from TV Tokyo this a I stop using Fairy Tail Cuts in your videos you idiot and American Music I haven't pried a problem with copyright issues but I did my first first place AMV was from the show Ruby how to use the song from a British or UK band called The Prodigy and it was called fire starter and Emi sent me a cease-and-desist letter. So a lot of its regionally-based being a former vice president of Domino's Pizza Shane and spouse us you could consider opening In-N-Out Goshi ation with Netflix to help them expand their already 130 countries out of the what I think 151 that exist into those Market ranges and maybe make some loose change or help them expand the internet services to rural areas. Anyways okay there's you about 35 reasons why you can't just start playing Netflix movies on you're at and second of all how are you doing that in the first place considering the Codex that they use is cut in the microseconds of blacks shots in between each video clip in a binary code method and then the audio video and subtitle of the video from the server has to go through the Netflix app kodak's to be recombined for broadcast onto a home viewing device see that's the real trick this year people that off then you should be answering all these stupid questions I answer yesterday about why I can't why people can't take screenshots of Netflix they're always black yeah that's because it's in binary code and it sent in microburst of video and then black scenes than video and black scenes and combined you can still record the audio and subtitles but the video is black so four five times yesterday and if you've got to work around for it put it in the comments for me and I will consider you a great man and a good coder"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Abdellatif Sekouri", "view_list": [36]}, "656": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "How good is Irfan Khan\u2019s acting?", "topic_list": ["Irrfan Khan (actor)", "Acting", "Bollywood Actors and Actresses", "Bollywood Movies", "Bollywood", "Actors and Actresses", "Movies", "India"], "no_of_view": "403", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Akhil Goli", "view_list": []}, "666": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 3, "name_list": ["Akshay Rajgor", "Rakesh Krishnan", "Aniruddha Bhattacharya"], "question_title": "Since I've binge the Game of Thrones very recently and I am now wanting more like it.

A big part of my life. Nothing satisfies me as much as superhero movies. Disney. Warner Bros. Fox. Sony. Martin Scorsese may consider none of these to be Scorsese-level good, but I don't care. They're my favorite movies. Since the question is asking based on what I have seen, therefore I will be answering based on MY personal opinions. Note: The following movies are not ranked in any particular order. They're all random.\nIron Man(2008)\nThe movie that started it all. I always remembered giving a big fat smile whenever I see Tony creating his tech. It's the little scenes like him testing out his repulsor tech and failing that makes me love the movie even more.\nX-Men: Days of Future Past(2014)\nI consider this movie to be one of the Elites. It's just so good. So many heartfelt moments. The ones that makes you feel like your heart was being crunched into a ball of paper. When Xavier made one final effort to stop Mystique while everyone from the future was being killed, you could feel Future Charles\u2019 and Erik\u2019s emotions, how they were so scared and thought that at the end they were going to lose. This is THE perfect ending for the X-Men franchise. Until, you know, the X-Men Prequels and Logan sort of ruined it.\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier(2014)\nThis movie has, without a doubt, one of the best fighting choreographers of any CBMs. This movie had a darker and serious tone, more emotional moments, and has the best costume design. It's more of a spy/thriller movie now that I think about it.\nGuardians of the Galaxy(2014)\nMan, what a year for comic book movies \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f. James Gunn is an amazing director. He nails the theme of family very well in his movies. Every character is unique and loveable in their own way. And with his use of the 80\u2019s music, this movie has the best Soundtrack ever.\nThe Dark Knight(2008)\nAbsolutely legendary. One of the Elites as well. They gave us the best Joker. They gave us the most gutwrenching story. And most importantly, it asks an important question about life: Are humans truly awful? Would we kill if it meant that we get to live?\nThe Dark Knight Rises(2012)\nUnpopular Opinion: I like The Dark Knight Rises more than The Dark Knight. Bane was such an evil villain that really scares you. What, you weren't scared? Just me? It was another good ending for a movie franchise. Bruce gets to retire in peace and passes his legacy to John Blake.\nAvengers: Endgame(2019)\nThis movie\u2026 This movie\u2026 It was everything I've always wanted. This movie is truly a movie for the fans. If you're a diehard MCU fan, you will absolutely love this movie to bits. The emotions you feel. Happiness when seeing Bro Thor. Sadness when seeing them depressed. Defeat when seeing them die. Excitement when seeing them Assemble. This movie turned theaters into stadiums. It gave such a good conclusion to some character arcs, and also gave birth for more possible stories in the future.\nSpider-Man 2(2004)\nThis is the most Comic Book Movie ever. A really inspiring story that talks about responsibility and how a hero\u2019s life is never easy. Sam Raimi just gets Spider-Man. The Russo Bros. owns Captain America. James Gunn owns the Guardians. Sam Raimi owns Spider-Man.\nAquaman(2018)\nThis movie is the most visually stunning comic book movie, mainly due to the bright colors of all the aquatic life. The cinematography and visual effects were the best. You could take any frame, pause it, and turn it into a painting or a screensaver. And alongside Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014), it has one of the best fighting sequences ever thanks to their camera work. How the camera just sits outside the fight and just revolves around the combatants.\nBatman(1989)\nAnother classic movie of my childhood. If we focus on just Batman, then this movie beats Nolan\u2019s work. I consider Michael Keston to be one of the best, if not the not the best, live action portrayal of Batman. This movie is like the DC version of Spider-Man 2(2004). Very Comic Book-esque, with gadgets, the Joker, etc. And while Guardians of the Galaxy(2014) has the best Soundtrack, this movie has the best Original Score. Danny Elfman is the best.", "Superheroes rule Hollywood.\nWhether you like it or not, this is a fact at the moment. It is impossible to separate the movie industry from characters that came out of the pages of a comic book.\nThroughout my time on Quora, I have been as staunch a critic of this dominance as anyone. From agreeing with Martin Scorsese, to hating on Marvel for firing Edgar Wright, to disliking the climactic Joker talk show scene, I have not been afraid to dislike the fellows at Marvel and DC.\nBut, even I have to admit that the superhero genre has spawned some damn good movies through its 40 year existence. Damn good movies I am more than excited to sink my teeth into, starting with my tenth favorite:\n10: Logan (2017)\nI\u2019ll start out with a film that is rather universally beloved, don\u2019t worry you know that I\u2019ll get controversial soon.\nLogan, anchored by Oscar Quality work from Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman, is a film that is enjoyable if deeply flawed.\nThe film is directed by James Mangold, who adds a western fair that becomes the films identity. I really enjoyed how entrenched the movie was in itself without coming off as self indulgent.\nMy big problem came with how derivative the plot was. It basically stole its plot beat by beat from Children of Men, which is a much better movie.\nOverall, the film is good, but some stupid moments (Hugh Jackman Clone) and an uninventive narrative keep it from greatness.\n9: Superman (1978)\nThis film is pure, unadulterated joy. It is a classic for a reason, when I think of classic cinema Superman is a movie that comes to mind. It owns the fact that it was made in a much simpler time.\nNow this isn\u2019t to say its totally dated, there are so many things in the movie that will never get old.\nThe first is the score, this is the John Williams superhero score and it does wonders for the film.\nThe acting from Hackman, Reeves, and Brando is also spectacular. Especially Hackman. He turns Lex Luther into such a fun character as opposed to the boring evil business guy of the source material.\nBut above all, what makes this film fun is how well it understands its main character; a man who just wants to do what\u2019s right. The movie makes you want to be more like Superman.\n8: Batman (1989)\nI really enjoy Burton\u2019s take on Bruce Wayne. It\u2019s by far my favorite part of this film. He really brings out Wayne\u2019s insanity, psychotic tendency, and violent nature. Comic purists will hate it, but it makes for a way more interesting character.\nUnlike Bale, Keaton\u2019s Bruce Wayne actually has feelings.\nThe rest of the film is pretty good too. One of my favorite aspects is the production design. I love how alien Gotham looks in the film, as if it\u2019s straight out of German Expressionism. Burton directs the film with style and this is the place where that\u2019s most prevalent.\nNow this movie is far from flawless, the love interest and villain are dull and it isn\u2019t exactly arresting in plot, but it\u2019s very good.\n7: The Dark Knight (2008)\nHere\u2019s my hot take, I\u2019d give The Dark Knight 7th place.\nI wrote about my thoughts on this film rather extensively in Alex Robinson's answer to What are the best almost great movies of all time?. You can read that review if you want, but I really think I sum up my thoughts rather well at the end of the answer:\n\u201cThe Dark Knight is frustrating because of how good some parts are. If you took the same treatment, actors, and technical minds and gave them to a really great director and screenwriter, it could have been amazing. Is it a good movie? Yes. A great one? Not at all.\u201d\n6: Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)\nGuardians of the Galaxy had no business being a great movie. Yet, it is undoubtedly a great movie.\nThis film has such a wonderful sense of humor too it. The characters in the movie are assholes, but lovably so.\nI would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the soundtrack, which is possibly the best example of combining loads of wonderfully written, emotionally relevant songs into one film. It is basically perfect.\nWhat isn\u2019t perfect is the plot, this film is predictable as they come and cliche as hell. The villain is boring and because of that you don\u2019t really care when the opposing forces finally face off at the end.\nThat dance battle scene is amazing though.\n5: Iron Man (2008)\nRobert Downey Jr., as he repeats throughout the MCU, is Iron Man.\nIron Man is a movie tied together by a virtuosic performance from its lead actor, who embodies all the pathos and charisma of the billionaire whose life is irreversibly changed.\nDon\u2019t think that Downey is the only exceptional performance in this film, he is joined by wonderful direction from Jon Favreau.\nFavreau takes a hands off approach, allowing the actors, action, and spectacle to breathe. He keeps the film completely unmuddied. This isn\u2019t boring filmmaking, it\u2019s subdued filmmaking.\nThis film also suffers from a poor villain, but it is a movie where the sum is so much greater than the parts.\n4: Spider Man (2002)\nSpider Man was one of the first movies I ever saw. I loved it as a 5 year old and I love it even more now.\nThe star of this film isn\u2019t Toby Maguire, it is Sam Raimi. Sam Raimi leaves his mark on every frame of this movie. Luckily, he has a perfect mark.\nThe disconnected editing, the frantic cinematography, the incredible visual humor. This is first and foremost a Sam Raimi film, it\u2019s possibly the most \u2018Sam Raimi\u2019 in existence.\nThat isn\u2019t to say the good stops at Raimi, even if it all flows through him. The action in this film is incredible.\nRaimi is not afraid to be brutal, in that final scene when Goblin beats Parker, you feel it. There is a palpable sense of danger despite the knowledge that Peter will come out on top. This adds tension to action scenes that in a movie like Iron Man would be the boring.\nDafoe is a highlight, the amount of camp he inserts into the Goblin is so much fun.\nThat\u2019s what this entire movie is, fun. The difference between this and other fun movies on this list is the exceptional artist behind the camera.\n3: The Incredibles (2004)\nSmack dab in the middle of Pixar\u2019s ten year reign of domination over animated films, they took their talents to the superhero genre.\nInstead of just making a simple superhero movie, they instead made a thematic film using unexplored aspects of the superhero.\nThe film starts this by casting superheroes as celebrities, something that had never been done before at the time. The villain of the movie is basically a crazed fan.\nIt also uses the superhero genre as a backdrop for a story about how a nuclear family falls apart due to suppression of who they are. Where most kids movies would say be yourself, The Incredibles subtly shows what happens when you put on a mask.\nI am talking about this thematic depth, but it\u2019s still a great kids movie and superhero flick.\nAmazing action, likable heroes, a fantastic villain, and animation that holds up surprisingly well catapults this film into the top 3 superhero movies ever made.\n2: The Avengers (2012)\nWhen I think of a blockbuster that just does everything really freaking well, my mind always goes to The Avengers.\nIt is a film that succeeds at everything it attempts to do with ease. It isn\u2019t visually stunning or thematically deep, it is just a perfect action comedy.\nThe wonderful script by writer/director Joss Whedon shines a spotlight on its 6 main characters and just lets them interact.\nSometimes they laugh, sometimes they argue, never do you want to look away from the screen.\nThis is mostly thanks to Whedon\u2019s talent for comedy. Outside of perhaps Spider Man this is the film on this list with the most laughs.\nMy only real complaint when it comes to this movie is that it isn\u2019t very rewatchable due to how surface level it is. Anything else I can say negative about the film is just complaining about something it was never trying to do in the first place.\n1: Spider Man 2 (2004)\nAlright, you all knew that when I put Spider Man so high on my list that this would be number one.\nThere hasn\u2019t been a doubt in my mind since I saw this film for the first time (Not when I was 6) that it is the best superhero movie of all time.\nEverything great I said about the first film is still great. As much as I\u2019d love to talk about Raimi for another paragraph, I won\u2019t bore you lot with even more rambling.\nInstead I will discuss just what makes the second Spider Man better than the first; a question I think can be summarized in one word, scale.\nEverything that the first film did well is improved upon.\nThe action is just as tense and visually pleasing, but even more extensive. With more people and emotions at stake.\nThe villain is just as fun to watch, but this time with an emotional core that goes beyond I\u2019m crazy.\nRaimi is just as in control of his craft, but this time he adds magical scenes like the Robotic Leg scene that allows him to show off his talent for horror.\nThe pathos behind Peter\u2019s character arc is even more well defined than in the first movie. In that film he must accept his responsibility. It is a very simple Point A to Point B arc that works very well. At the start he is a regular guy, at the end he is a hero.\nThis film takes a more interesting approach that follows Parker as he struggles with his identity as a hero, even giving up the cape all together, only to rediscover his desire to help others at the end. This isn\u2019t only a much less cliche arc, it is a much deeper one as well.\nAlso, J. Jonah Jameson. Possibly the greatest bit part in the history of cinema.\nYep, this movie is basically perfect.\nWow, that was a lot of writing. This answer that I meant to spend 20 minutes on turned into 3 straight hours and 2000 words. At this point, I\u2019m sure you are tired of reading.\nBut still, I hope you enjoyed my exploration into the greatest Superhero movies ever created and; for Pete\u2019s sake, go have Pizza Time.\n(Additional Notes are in the comments)", "Superheroes rule Hollywood.\nWhether you like it or not, this is a fact at the moment. It is impossible to separate the movie industry from characters that came out of the pages of a comic book.\nThroughout my time on Quora, I have been as staunch a critic of this dominance as anyone. From agreeing with Martin Scorsese, to hating on Marvel for firing Edgar Wright, to disliking the climactic Joker talk show scene, I have not been afraid to dislike the fellows at Marvel and DC.\nBut, even I have to admit that the superhero genre has spawned some damn good movies through its 40 year existence. Damn good movies I am more than excited to sink my teeth into, starting with my tenth favorite:\n10: Logan (2017)\nI\u2019ll start out with a film that is rather universally beloved, don\u2019t worry you know that I\u2019ll get controversial soon.\nLogan, anchored by Oscar Quality work from Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman, is a film that is enjoyable if deeply flawed.\nThe film is directed by James Mangold, who adds a western fair that becomes the films identity. I really enjoyed how entrenched the movie was in itself without coming off as self indulgent.\nMy big problem came with how derivative the plot was. It basically stole its plot beat by beat from Children of Men, which is a much better movie.\nOverall, the film is good, but some stupid moments (Hugh Jackman Clone) and an uninventive narrative keep it from greatness.\n9: Superman (1978)\nThis film is pure, unadulterated joy. It is a classic for a reason, when I think of classic cinema Superman is a movie that comes to mind. It owns the fact that it was made in a much simpler time.\nNow this isn\u2019t to say its totally dated, there are so many things in the movie that will never get old.\nThe first is the score, this is the John Williams superhero score and it does wonders for the film.\nThe acting from Hackman, Reeves, and Brando is also spectacular. Especially Hackman. He turns Lex Luther into such a fun character as opposed to the boring evil business guy of the source material.\nBut above all, what makes this film fun is how well it understands its main character; a man who just wants to do what\u2019s right. The movie makes you want to be more like Superman.\n8: Batman (1989)\nI really enjoy Burton\u2019s take on Bruce Wayne. It\u2019s by far my favorite part of this film. He really brings out Wayne\u2019s insanity, psychotic tendency, and violent nature. Comic purists will hate it, but it makes for a way more interesting character.\nUnlike Bale, Keaton\u2019s Bruce Wayne actually has feelings.\nThe rest of the film is pretty good too. One of my favorite aspects is the production design. I love how alien Gotham looks in the film, as if it\u2019s straight out of German Expressionism. Burton directs the film with style and this is the place where that\u2019s most prevalent.\nNow this movie is far from flawless, the love interest and villain are dull and it isn\u2019t exactly arresting in plot, but it\u2019s very good.\n7: The Dark Knight (2008)\nHere\u2019s my hot take, I\u2019d give The Dark Knight 7th place.\nI wrote about my thoughts on this film rather extensively in Alex Robinson's answer to What are the best almost great movies of all time?. You can read that review if you want, but I really think I sum up my thoughts rather well at the end of the answer:\n\u201cThe Dark Knight is frustrating because of how good some parts are. If you took the same treatment, actors, and technical minds and gave them to a really great director and screenwriter, it could have been amazing. Is it a good movie? Yes. A great one? Not at all.\u201d\n6: Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)\nGuardians of the Galaxy had no business being a great movie. Yet, it is undoubtedly a great movie.\nThis film has such a wonderful sense of humor too it. The characters in the movie are assholes, but lovably so.\nI would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the soundtrack, which is possibly the best example of combining loads of wonderfully written, emotionally relevant songs into one film. It is basically perfect.\nWhat isn\u2019t perfect is the plot, this film is predictable as they come and cliche as hell. The villain is boring and because of that you don\u2019t really care when the opposing forces finally face off at the end.\nThat dance battle scene is amazing though.\n5: Iron Man (2008)\nRobert Downey Jr., as he repeats throughout the MCU, is Iron Man.\nIron Man is a movie tied together by a virtuosic performance from its lead actor, who embodies all the pathos and charisma of the billionaire whose life is irreversibly changed.\nDon\u2019t think that Downey is the only exceptional performance in this film, he is joined by wonderful direction from Jon Favreau.\nFavreau takes a hands off approach, allowing the actors, action, and spectacle to breathe. He keeps the film completely unmuddied. This isn\u2019t boring filmmaking, it\u2019s subdued filmmaking.\nThis film also suffers from a poor villain, but it is a movie where the sum is so much greater than the parts.\n4: Spider Man (2002)\nSpider Man was one of the first movies I ever saw. I loved it as a 5 year old and I love it even more now.\nThe star of this film isn\u2019t Toby Maguire, it is Sam Raimi. Sam Raimi leaves his mark on every frame of this movie. Luckily, he has a perfect mark.\nThe disconnected editing, the frantic cinematography, the incredible visual humor. This is first and foremost a Sam Raimi film, it\u2019s possibly the most \u2018Sam Raimi\u2019 in existence.\nThat isn\u2019t to say the good stops at Raimi, even if it all flows through him. The action in this film is incredible.\nRaimi is not afraid to be brutal, in that final scene when Goblin beats Parker, you feel it. There is a palpable sense of danger despite the knowledge that Peter will come out on top. This adds tension to action scenes that in a movie like Iron Man would be the boring.\nDafoe is a highlight, the amount of camp he inserts into the Goblin is so much fun.\nThat\u2019s what this entire movie is, fun. The difference between this and other fun movies on this list is the exceptional artist behind the camera.\n3: The Incredibles (2004)\nSmack dab in the middle of Pixar\u2019s ten year reign of domination over animated films, they took their talents to the superhero genre.\nInstead of just making a simple superhero movie, they instead made a thematic film using unexplored aspects of the superhero.\nThe film starts this by casting superheroes as celebrities, something that had never been done before at the time.

These include the hapless mayor, DA Harvey Dent, and the tired old, dead on his feat, Commissioner Gordon who is struggling to fight against the corruption.\nIt speaks volumes to this antidemocracy theory when Gordon bursts into the Ace Chemical plant, having immediately guessed Grishom's plan (both to remove evidence and to kill his own goons to cover it up), Gordon tells Eckhart to his face \u201cI'm in charge not Grisham.\u201d He then tells all the cops on site not to kill anyone. We the audiance see that Gordon, commissioner of the police, knows full well that Eckhart and his cops are not wortht of trust. So we must ask, why did he not fire them years ago? The answer is because he's an old tired man and only just keeping up.\nBut Batman is doing more than keeping up. Unlike the decrepit democratic state, Bruce Wayne is wealthy, young, energetic, tech savvy. Yet he is also down to Earth, a middle class turtleneck wearing guy who's best friend is his Butler.\nLet us not forget that the city is so financially strapped that the people themselves flock to Joker, despite knowing that he has murdered countless people by that point.\nJoker's television appearances show him make bold faced lies that his own audiance could not have but known were lies. His own earlier performances showed him bragging about murdering people, and then he insisted that he is not a killer. Before the Joker and his manipulative PR campaign, the mayor is hapless. He is dismissed with the wave of Joker's hand.\nHe has named himself Joker, dressed like a clown, committed murder, and yet the people trust him instantly when he offers them money. The people flock to Joker, showing the failure of democracy under an electorate so easily manipulated.\nBatman ultimately saves Gotham from itself. The representatives of the democratic government enthusiastically welcome Batman as their new overlord by proudly using his signal.\nBatman Returns carries on the tradition.\nGrishom is replaced by Max Shrek, unscrupulous capitalist who is robbing the city (by trying to build a power plant that drains power somehow?) He is the new villian, the capitalist greed.\nShreks avarice nearly dooms Gotham when he brings in Oswald Cobblepot and offers him great power in exchange for approving the power plant. The Penguin is in fact a child murderer and leader of a large criminal gang.\nOnce again, the elected officials are weak.

The space exploration community publicizes any particularly notable astronomical phenomenon to call attention to the fascinating, and valuable, work they do, not only to emphasize its intrinsically interesting character, but (quite naturally) to encourage its public support. The news \u2018Media\u2019 however tend to over-sensationalize just about everything. The Media sells more Adverts if there are more viewers, and \u2018Disaster Porn\u2019 sells well. This is the \u2018Catastrophic\u2019 version of the old adage about the Media: \u201cIf it bleeds, it leads\u201d, describing Media\u2019s well known infatuation with blood, gore, violence and catastrophe. 1998 OR2 will pass something like 16 times the distance of the Moon from the Earth. But this doesn\u2019t stop much of Media from touting it as a \u2018near miss\u2019. The fact is that they\u2019d do better to educate the public to the very real \u2018gaps\u2019 in our Planetary Defense systems, which is systems to detect smaller objects, and especially objects coming from the general direction of the Sun, not to mention a need to gradually and steadily develop technology to defend us from possible future collisions and building a sustainable Space Program providing an infrastructure to deploy such technology\u2026..\nI hope this help\u2026.", "\u201cBasically, I understand about this Asteroid 1998 OR2 is that it is a member of the dynamical Amor group of asteroids, and therefore does not currently cross Earth's orbit. The asteroid's closest approach to the Sun is just outside Earth's furthest distance from the Sun. When the asteroid has a perihelion point less than 1.017 AU (Earth's aphelion), it is classified an Apollo Asteroid .This asteroid's category flips back and forth as time passes, due to minor perturbations.\u201d\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0\u20133.7 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,344 days; semi- major axis of 2.38 AU). Its orbit has a high eccentricity of 0.57 and an inclination of 6\u00b0\nwith respect to the ecliptic. With its sufficiently large aphelion this asteroid is also classified as a Mars crosser, crossing the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.66 AU.\nNASA estimates that the asteroid is between 1.1 miles and 2.5 miles (1.8 to 4.1 kilometers) wide. According to Asteroid Watch, 1998 OR2 will pass and that it will pass by at a safe distance that is more than 16 times the average distance between Earth and the moon. While NASA classifies asteroids that come within less than 4.6 million miles (7.5 million km) of Earth as \"potentially hazardous,\" there's nothing to worry about with 1998 OR2.\n\"The orbit is well understood and it will pass harmlessly at 16 times the distance to our moon,\" NASA wrote on Twitter. \"No one should have any concern about it.\"\n\u201cSo I don't know what media show on television, because there is no worry about this Asteroid as NASA has explained about it clearly. So these are the astronomical accidents which are happened in space at time to time .so don't worry about this our earth has no harm by this Asteroid so we all are safe ..\u201d", "Because it is going to pass \u2018close\u2019 to Earth - missing us by \u2018only\u2019 3,900,000 miles - about 17 times the distance to the Moon."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Kawi Singh", "view_list": [16, 44, 157, 7]}, "229": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What happened to Deacon's wife in days gone?", "topic_list": ["Movies"], "no_of_view": "250", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Smith Gilliam", "view_list": []}, "763": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "How can I download the movie Black Widow (2020) in 720p, 1440p, or 4k?", "topic_list": ["Black Widow (spider)", "Black Widow (Marvel character)", "HD Movies", "4K (format)", "Movie Downloads", "Hollywood", "Marvel Cinematic Universe", "Downloading", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "73", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Mohammad Wasi", "view_list": []}, "822": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Kai Fara"], "question_title": "How do you think viewing events, especially tragedies, through the medium of a screen affects our feelings towards it?", "topic_list": ["Tragedies", "Understanding Emotions", "Emotions", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "179", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["Its nothing it's just our mind starts to make scenarios, and we like we are right in that scene ,just imagination nothing else"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Vanessa Camacho", "view_list": [3]}, "55": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Donna Hopkins"], "question_title": "Did you watch Don't F with Cats?

It was even, at one point and time, an extremely common design among the Jedi, but this was due more to utilitarian circumstance than preference. You see this hilt construction was a specialization for a particular style of lightsaber combat, specifically Form II, or Makashi, which is the form he Mastered as well.\nMakashi was a precision blade-work style, meant to be used against another lightsaber/vibrosword wielding opponent. The abrupt angle at the bottom of the hilt is there to provide additional control over the blade compared to standard straight hilted sabers. In other words, Dooku\u2019s lightsaber was a dueling weapon.\nMakashi was very popular among the Jedi for millennia, but as I mentioned before, it was born out of circumstance, that being, the Sith Empire. During the Sith\u2019s Golden Age, they were constantly at war with the Jedi, and the Jedi were bound to go head to head with them in lightsaber duels on a frequent basis, thus Makashi was a necessity, of the era. But after the Sith Empire\u2019s destruction at the hand of Darth Bane, the need for a lightsaber dueling form became nearly insignificant compared to the need for blaster deflection skills provided by Form III, Soresu and the Shien variant of Form V (which used standard straight hilts), since this was what their opponents were most often equipped with. While it was still possible to come across someone equipped with a lost lightsaber, or a perhaps a vibrosword, more often than not they would either be unskilled, or unable to compete with a Jedi\u2019s force enhanced reflexes, so Makashi slowly fell out of favor, and became simply a stepping stone for other Lightsaber Forms.\nSo, fast forwarding to the present (or past\u2026what trilogy are you in?), when Dooku decides to base his lightsaber hilt on early dueling sabers, in an era where the only enemies this gives you an advantage over are other Jedi, one can understand why Yoda might have given him the stink eye.\nAnd when you combine this with his dislike of the Republic (on account of its political corruption), and standing Jedi traditions, and you can see why they would continue to be at odds."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Dustin Darby", "view_list": [0]}, "497": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What's a real incident that was so extraordinary that it could be a movie scene?", "topic_list": ["Extraordinary", "Incident", "Movie Scenes", "Movie Story and Plot Themes", "Bollywood Movies", "Movie Production", "Hollywood", "Movie Business and Industry", "Movies", "Experiences in Life"], "no_of_view": "41", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "James Ronald", "view_list": []}, "206": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "Nitesh Rane's wife is Rutuja Shinde.

While this still happens today, this is much less common. In the times before the internet you might plan ahead to go see the big summer blockbuster, but otherwise you'd just go to the theater to see what was playing, and posters caught your eye for that.\nThis started not being the case by the time most homes had TV with commercials and movie studios advertised their movies there, even if you had to see if it was playing at your theater before making the trip by calling them, but by the age of the internet and easily-accessible reviews, and the proliferation of home video meaning that people didn't have to go to the theater to watch movies, anyone who cared to go to the movies would research their movie choice beforehand and wouldn't care about the posters.\nAs the poster influenced less and less peoples' viewing choices, it started taking less and less of films' overall marketing budget, so while in the older films you might have hired a well-known artist to create the perfect poster for your big-budget movie of the summer, nowadays you can get an intern to slap something together in InDesign in an afternoon and call it a day.\nFurther: Earlier in the history of posters, there was no data available as to how well other posters worked to drive ticket sales. Nowadays, there's a lot of data but not a lot of critical thought into interpreting it; any big movie that does well always ends up having elements copied without much thought as to why they worked in the original.

Using social media and the internet, he uses every tool at his disposal to become close to her, even going so far as to remove any obstacle --including people -- that stands in his way of getting to her.\nAre you a chilling and bubbly one!..and you like sitcom and comedy then \u201c FRIENDS\u201d and \u201cBIG BANG THEORY\u201d is worth watching.\nFollow the lives of six reckless adults living in Manhattan, as they indulge in adventures which make their lives both troublesome and happening.\u2014\u201dFRIENDS\u201d\nThe lives of four socially awkward friends, Leonard, Sheldon, Howard and Raj, take a wild turn when they meet the beautiful and free-spirited Penny.-\u2014\u201dbig bang theory\u201d.\nThat's all from my side!\u2026\nIf you like any of these series ..Doo upvote my answer!", "Series\nPanchayat\nMoney heist\nAsur\nSpecial opa\nExtraction\nMovies\nGuilty\nMarvel old series\nBhoot\nAladdin"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Tushar Pal", "view_list": [92, 16, 129, 4]}, "549": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["Sourav Srivastava", "Aaditya Sharma"], "question_title": "Can I watch Gangs of Wasseypur 2 before watching its part 1?

Not to mention that Tom Hiddleston is beloved, and the main reason why Loki is so popular is his performance.\nA significant number of people will be\u2026 disappointed\u2026 if they tune into a show thinking it will be all about this guy only to discover that 25\u201350% of Loki\u2019s scenes are using a completely different actress.\nAlso there would be the not inconsiderable difficulty of having to get the actress and Hiddleston\u2019s performances to match. Not only so they are recognizably playing the same person down to the most minute movements, but also so they are presenting coherent emotional arcs both through the episodes and across the season. They both have to play the same emotions the same way, with the same line readings, while also developing the same character growth at the same time.\nIt would be incredibly challenging for two actors.\nBut! And here\u2019s the but!\nTom Hiddleston is a very busy actor who is doing an entirely different TV show simultaneously with Loki. The costs associated with adding a second Loki to the cast might be worth it if the practicality of giving Hiddleston a more flexible schedule is also considered into the equation.\nA Loki where Loki is played by an actress 25% of the time would be preferable to no Loki at all because Hiddleston simply can\u2019t commit to filming.\nSo that\u2019s how I come to the fact that it is simultaneously both unlikely but also very possible.", "Idk.

No matter how terrible a movie adaptation might be, the book is still there, ready to be read again and again, completely unharmed and untouched by the terrible film.\nNow, if you\u2019re asking which film adaptation did the worst job of it, I\u2019ll go with the completely wrong-headed mess they made out of Steinbeck\u2019s Cannery Row.", "No book has ever been \u201cdestroyed\u201d by its movie adaptation; the book is still there on the shelf, unchanged, for anyone who wants to read it.\nSome books - probably most! - are ill-served by their movie adaptations.\nA book is well-served by its movie adaptation if it successfully conveys the essence of the book. Examples of this include The Maltese Falcon and, more recently, The Martian. Things can and indeed must be changed in adapting a book to film. For one thing, a movie is too short to contain everything that\u2019s in most books, so the first thing the scenarist has to do is decide what to take out. In addition, some things that work well in writing don\u2019t work as well in a movie; for example, a long interior monologue will have to be either cut or replaced with some form of exposition. (Sometimes a movie tries to include interior monologue by using a voice-over. This rarely works and often elicits giggles from audients.)\nLet\u2019s dissect one of my favorite books that was semi-competently translated to film: Peter Jackson\u2019s adaptation of The Lord of the Rings.\nVisually, the film version is stunning; time and again I found myself thinking, yes, that\u2019s what this person/place/thing should look like. There are exceptions; for example, I think Rivendell should have looked more organic, more part of the surrounding scenery, possibly even hard to spot. But on the whole, it looks great.\nHe also got some key scenes very right: the death of Boromir; Sam\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t go where I can\u2019t follow\u201d scene; the denouement at the Gray Havens.\nJackson also made some intelligent choices in cutting. For example, Tom Bombadil clearly had to go; he would be a distraction at best.\nIt\u2019s where Jackson changed and even added plot elements that I have problems.\nExample 1: Arwen. I understand the idea behind giving her Glorfindel\u2019s role so she would not be just a background figure who suddenly shows up to marry Aragorn. I get that.\nBut I don\u2019t get the whole scene where she\u2019s traveling with a bunch of Elves and suddenly has this vision of her child, and turns around and goes back to get And\u00f9ril reforged \u2014 that was totally created by Jackson, and completely unnecessary. Elrond had And\u00f9ril reforged while the Fellowship was still at Rivendell.\nAnd as for the ludicrous scene where she appears to Aragorn by some sort of Elf-telepathy \u2026 well, the less said about that, the better.\nExample 2: Faramir. Jackson & company clearly completely missed the point of Faramir; he was everything Boromir could and should have been. He passes the test of the Ring, which Boromir failed; and he sees the wisdom-in-foolishness of Frodo\u2019s quest.\nInstead, Jackson has him drag Frodo & co. to Osgiliath, releasing him only when the Nazg\u00fbl arrive - at which point, Frodo should be doomed because the Nazg\u00fbl would have sensed the presence of the Ring and, in any case, would have been sure to pounce on any escaping \u201chalflings\u201d.\nExample 3: The Gollum/Sm\u00e8agol - Frodo - Sam relationship, and particularly Jackson\u2019s hideous \u201cGo home, Sam!\u201d scene. That was a complete betrayal of the deep friendship between Frodo and Sam.\nYes, I know, Jackson is trying to show how eeeeevil and manipulative Gollum is, but in fact it betrays that character also. At this point Gollum is a deeply conflicted character, trying to be \u201cgood\u201d while at the same time out of his mind with the desire of the Ring and deliberately leading Frodo to where Shelob will kill him and absolve him of his oath to Frodo - which he cannot break until the imminent threat of the Ring\u2019s destruction utterly breaks him, leading to his death and the Ring\u2019s destruction with it.\nI think three examples is enough for the purpose.\nNow: Has Jackson \u201cdestroyed\u201d The Lord of the Rings?\nNo. As I said, the book is still there on my shelf. The last time I read it, it hadn\u2019t changed. Some of the pictures in my mind had been made clearer by those in the movie (I\u2019m not normally a very visual reader), but the hideously misbegotten scenes Jackson added simply aren\u2019t there. Elrond reforged And\u00f9ril and sent it with Aragorn and the Fellowship. Faramir still released Frodo, Sam and Sm\u00e9agol. Gollum/Sm\u00e9agol remains the sad, conflicted, lost Hobbit that Tolkien created.\nSo, no, the book is not destroyed. But it has been ill-served. People seeing the film first will be puzzled, and possibly annoyed, that the book doesn\u2019t match up with the film (much as I was annoyed by some of the ways the film failed to match up with the book).

What happens when one of the arishadvargas overwhelm an individual completely that the line between a man and a beast becomes blurred. Directed by Dayal Padmanabhan, Aa Karaala Ratri (= that dreadful night) showcases the tale of such a family, which plumbs the depths to the point of no return.\nCirca 1980s rural Karnataka. A nondescript, poor family in an unnamed village is accosted by a stranger Chennakeshava (Karthik Jayaram) who requests shelter for the night since the next village is several miles away. The patriarch Muthanna (Rangayana Raghu), his wife Gowramma (Veena Sundar), and their sexually frustrated daughter Mallika (Anupama Gowda) are initially hesitant on the offer. But when Chennakeshava offers them generous payment for their services, they readily agree. Steadily, Chennakeshava gains their trust and discovers that Muthanna has mortgaged the family land to the moneylender, and the latter is persisting for Mallika\u2019s hand in marriage. Chennakeshava reveals that he has earned enough money for life and displays the cash and jewelry to the family. The family\u2019s greed is tickled, and Mallika suggests a plan to bump off the stranger. While Gowramma is hesitant about it, Muthanna and Mallika pressurize her into agreeing to the plan: to lace the chicken curry with a poisonous brew. However, Gowramma doesn\u2019t go along with the plan, and so Mallika takes the matter into her own hands and slits the stranger\u2019s throat. Meanwhile, Muthanna who has been whiling away in a nearby arrack shop discovers a shocking truth about the strange and rushes to the stop the killing, but to no avail.\nAa Karala Ratri works mainly because of the tight screenplay and top-notch acting from the cast, particularly Anupama Gowda. Although Karthik Jayaram\u2019s character is largely one-note and his acting his average, in this case, his underperformance works in favor of the movie. Rangayana Raghu goes overboard as a drunkard, but elsewhere his performance has been restrained and so does Veena Sundar. My only gripe in an otherwise flawless movie is a dream song that pops up in the middle of the film. The Wikipedia entry for Aa Karaala Ratri classifies the movie as a suspense thriller, but I would consider it as a horror movie. While ghosts, spirits, banshees, haunted houses can be terrifying movie subjects, normal humans transforming into monsters is scarier than any supernatural spirit. In that sense, the movie can be suitably classified as a horror movie.\nWhen Aa Karaala Ratri was released in 2018, I believe that not many audiences saw the movie nor was it screened in multiplexes or single-screen theatres across the state. Nevertheless, the proliferation of OTT platforms has provided independent films a new lease of life. In fact, I have watched a good number of Kannada films, some of which failed at the box office or were taken off theatres due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Otherwise, gems like Dia (a love story), Love Mocktail (nostalgia), and Mayabazar 2016 (heist) would have been buried under an avalanche of new releases. Traditionally, the Kannada film industry has relied on a producer-distributor model for releasing movies. This meant that unless the movie boasts of a well-known cast, distributors won\u2019t touch it with a bargepole. Or, even if the distributors decide to release a movie with unknown names, it will be confined to a few theatres or odd shows in multiplexes, which discourages independent film producers. Alternatively, producers can release the movie themselves, but this model is too fraught with risks.\nWith cheap internet and proliferation of OTT platforms, producers of independent movies can think of an alternate business model: release movies solely for OTT platforms, bypassing the travails of movie release in multiplexes and single-screen theatres. This model would be beneficial for movies that cannot attract big-name stars and have to rely on quality content. How the Covid-19 pandemic will play out for the cinema industry is unclear, but I hope that a new business model will emerge, which will level the playing field for big-budget and independent films.\nAa Karaaala Ratri is available on Hotstar and a Hindi dubbed version is available on YouTube.", "The Kannada film Aa Karaala Ratri is an outstanding gem of a film.

A lot of the banter between characters was horrible. In what galaxy is \u201cAt least we have R2 with us\u201d worth a \u201ctee hee hee\u201d? A lot of the CGI was unconvincing (e.g. the platform falling on Obi-Wan and flipping out of the elevator shaft in Episode 3).\nBut the story made sense. Palpatine was behind the scenes, manipulating everything and eventually drawing Anakin over to the Dark Side. Yes, his final flip into killing children was sudden, but you saw his overall frustration at being held back and his desire to be all powerful developing well over the course of 3 movies. And it tied in well to the original trilogy. After waiting for so long, it felt like we finally got the rest of the story. And to be fair, a lot of the scenes (particularly in Episode 3) were very well done.\nThe sequels? Thrown together by many different people without any over-arching plan or storyline in mind. The first one was basically a rehash of A New Hope. The second one seems to be designed more along the lines \u201chaha! Gotcha! Bet you didn\u2019t expect that!\u201d rather than any sort of coherent story. And then the last one had to try and undo a lot of the mess made by the second one, then threw in it\u2019s own things that made no sense. Honestly it\u2019s better just to pretend they are some bad fan-fiction.\nWe all know what the real sequel trilogy is.", "People should really not talk in absolutes. Not everyone has the same opinion you. While it\u2019s not my favorite of the ST, I didn\u2019t see it as a hot mess.", "Short answer:\nThe prequels were not good films, certainly not good Star Wars films, but they at least had a coherent plot, consistent direction, and actually made an effort to be something more than a blatant cash grab.\nLonger answer:\n(background music)\nI\u2019m willing to admit that my griping and moaning about the Prequels in my younger years was almost entirely simple bandwagon hate.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the prequels were great. I appreciate what George Lucas tried to do, I appreciate the improved lightsaber combat and lore (and now despise with a passion those who say the lightsaber combat in the original trilogy was boring without even taking the time period or the technology involved in those kinds of props at the time into account), I kind of appreciated that he tried to tell Darth Vader\u2019s origin story even though it absolutely wasn\u2019t necessary (the mystery of who Vader was, his past, etc, only added to his overall menace; giving him a three film backstory kind of ruins his character).\nBut Jar Jar was dumb, Qui-Gon didn\u2019t get enough screen time or any real character development, making Anakin a child wasn\u2019t the best move and ruined Jake Lloyd\u2019s life, giving anakin a love interest was cliche, the over usage of green and blue screens removed a lot of the action and tension they could have had if they\u2019d used practical effects and sets, and George Lucas simply isn\u2019t a good director in these films.\nEven the lightsaber combat, while improved, took away some of the appeal for me. In the original trilogy, to draw a lightsaber meant that something very serious was going on, and it happened rarely. To my knowledge, there were only 11 lightsaber appearances in the entire original trilogy:\nA New Hope:\n#1. When Obi-Wan shows the lightsaber to Luke.\n#2. When Obi-Wan cuts that dude\u2019s arm off in the bar.\n#3. When Luke is using it to train.\n#4. When Obi-Wan fights Darth Vader.\nThe Empire Strikes Back:\n#5. When Luke is attacked by the Wampa.\n#6. When Han uses the lightsaber to cut open the TaunTaun to save Luke.\n#7. When Luke fights \u201cVader\u201d in the Force Tree.\n#8. When Luke fights Vader in Cloud City.\nThe Return of the Jedi:\n#9. During the escape from the Sarlacc.\n#10. Deflecting blaster bolts from an imperial speeder bike.\n#11. The final duel against Vader.\nLightsabers in the prequels were more about how cool lightsabers are, rather than what lightsabers represent. There was never really any emotional content to the duels. Very flashy, very well choreographed, but lacking in the emotional substance that makes the duel actually mean something.\nCan you tell me why any of the duels in The Phantom Menace matter? Do Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan have any prior relation to Darth Maul? For that matter, have I been given any indication who even our MAIN CHARACTERS ARE?\nI have no idea who Qui-Gon is, and sure, while I know who Obi-Wan is, that\u2019s only from the original films.\nI have no idea who this \u201cnew Obi-Wan\u201d is beyond nostalgia. I don\u2019t know why he became a jedi, I don\u2019t know why I need to care whether he lives or dies. Who are his family? His friends? What does he care about, or fight to protect?\nWith Luke, we got an impatient, whiny, but idealistic young man who wanted to join the Empire and see the stars, but was led to a crazy old man in the desert by a wayward droid, who offered him a different path, which he refused at first until his family was killed. He began his training out of a sense of hopelessness and revenge.\nBut who is Qui-Gon? Just a mostly nondescript Jedi Master (no, the extended universe doesn\u2019t count) who showed up for an hour and then died. Great character development there.\nWhy do the duels in The Clone Wars matter? Sure, Anakin wants to protect Obi-Wan and defeat Dooku, but WHO IS DOOKU?! What\u2019s his motivation? Where did he come from?\nAnd the only duel in Revenge of the Sith that matters is the one between Anakin and Obi-Wan, because their relationship has actually been somewhat developed over the course of three films, but overall, even THAT duel is still bogged down by an overabundance of Hollywood choreography and an overdeveloped sense of grandeur.\nLightsabers aren\u2019t simply cool toys. There is a weight to them, a weight to when, where, and why they are used. Jedi, to my knowledge, were modeled after Samurai films, such as those made by Akira Kurosawa. To the Samurai, their Katana was not simply a weapon. It was a part of their soul. To draw the blade meant to, in a sense, draw upon themselves, to draw upon their feelings to protect themselves, protect the weak, or defeat the enemy.\nThat\u2019s why the duels matter so much in the original trilogy; neither Obi-Wan or Luke ever just \u201cwhip it out\u201d without thinking. There\u2019s always a good reason.\nAs for the rest of the prequel trilogy (now that I\u2019ve ranted for a week about lightsabers), it just wasn\u2019t well directed. Perhaps those are films that show why it\u2019s not always a good idea for the creator of an intellectual property to have 100% control 100% of the time.\nBut for all the flaws of the prequels, at least you can tell that real effort was made.\nI can\u2019t say the same for \u201cDisney Wars\u201d, which saw each film change hands with directors, get injected with politics with Kathleen Kennedy, verbally attack the fans when they complained, calling them sexists, even the battle between the directors as the films went on; J.J. Abrams setting everything up with TFA, Rian Johnson and his astoundingly massive ego undoing all of that with TLJ, only to then have Abrams come back for TRoS and try to salvage what he could from the wreckage, while Mark Hamill went on record about how much he disliked the directions taken with the story and characters, George Lucas feeling betrayed by the actions taken by Disney and Bob Iger, Steve Martin forced to apologize for calling Carrie Fisher \u201cbeautiful\u201d upon her death, etc, and no end to Disney whoring out Star Wars (and now Marvel and betraying Netflix, maybe even buying DC soon) for cash anywhere in sight.\nThe entire affair is one of undisguised greed, anger, hatred, and all-round\u2019 ugliness. I always thought Disney was overrated, but now I just hate the conglomerate as a whole.\nThe prequels are not good, but they\u2019re platinum-plated gold bars in comparison to Disney.\nP.S.\nIf you\u2019re going to go ahead and over-choreograph your lightsaber duels, at least bring in people who actually know how to make it look badass. I mean, can you imagine a lightsaber duel, but choreographed by the people who did \u201cThe Raid\u201d movies?", "Nope. I'm fine with both the sequels and the prequels, generally speaking. But the prequels narrative was a mess up until (and sort of through) Revenge of the Sith. The characters were underserved and underdevelop, and the dialogue was awkward and prone to exposition dumps. While Rise of Skywalker did muddy the plot, a lot, at least the overall story was at least viable up until that point.\nI admire what George Lucas was trying to do with the prequel trilogy. He was trying to set up the tragic fall of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, as well as the conditions behind the demise of the Republic. Had Lucas tried a little more subtlty, rather than shoehorning plot and weak characterization, he would've created a vital and lively backstory for his original trilogy. A few \u201cno\u201d women and men to reign in his narrative wouldn't have hurt, either.\nFor me, ROS and ROS, were, ironically, the best and worst of their respective trilogies. Revenge because it tried to and somewhat succeeded in cleaning up the mess of Episodes I and II; Rise because it thought there was a mess to clean up, rather than just a storyline to follow-through on.\nAnd sadly, we ended up with an uneven Skywalker saga. Yet somehow that seems fitting for a series that arrived with a bang and left with a shrug, and threw out plenty of baby shrugs along the way.\nAll in all, I've enjoyed the process of getting there. And I'm sure I'm rewatch the whole story from time to time (possibly Eps I & II with the help of Rifftrax). After all, it's still a fun space fantasy epic\u2014and that's really all it is, cultural touchstone or otherwise. And I'm still looking forward to more, especially Mandalorian-wise.", "No, the prequels are a mess, and Rise of Skywalker being a failure of both planning and execution doesn't change that.\nWhat it does do is offer a good example of how there's more than one way to produce a bad movie.\nThe prequels are poorly-conceived, trying to tell a story that's best left untold, and definitely poorly executed, with their flat and boring characters, now dated special effects that make everything look like a cartoon, and atrocious dialogue, but what can't be denied is that they are the singular vision of a weirdo who felt completely unfettered, who made exactly the simultaneously extremely bizarre and boring epic he wanted to make.\nThe Rise of Skywalker is the opposite: a movie made out of corporate-mandated necessity, the result of a mediocre and wholly unoriginal director being hired to course correct after the second, extremely divisive, movie in a planned trilogy upended his first installment's workmanlike remake of the original. It's slapped together and almost bafflingly terrible at places, but it makes sense when you realize it's made by people who didn't have a story to tell so much as a series of nostalgia boxes to check.", "I agree completely! while the new trilogy was designed to simply be a shallow remake of the original trilogy, with very little effort put into it (especially in the worldbuilding department), lots of effort was actually put into writing the prequals, making them more than just boring cash grabs. The ships, vehicles, droids, and all that stuff in the new trilogy were mostly just OT ships and such with a new coat of paint, the ones in the prequels were original designs and, if we're being honest here, totally badass. While the factions in the new trilogy are literally just the Rebellion and the Empire with different names, the factions in the prequels are well written, and plenty of effort went into the worldbuilding and politics surrounding the separatist movement, the Conferacy of Independent Systems, the Free Trade Zone, and the like in order to make an intriguing story. Also, unlike the new trilogy, the characters were original, whereas the characters in the new movies are all just poor remakes of the characters from the original trilogy. And let us not forget Ray Sue\u2026 Anyways, the prequels get a lot of shit, but they were, in my opinion at least, good movies and so much better than the glorified fanfictions which Disney markets as Star Wars movies.", "No, the prequels were a good concept namely: \u201cthe story of how the dark lord of the Sith engineered a Civil War in order to become Emperor of the Galaxy while simultaneously corrupting a great and noble Jedi Knight to become his loyal follower\u201d. The story, that is to say the series of events which play out this premise a mess.\nThe same is true of the sequels: \u201cyears after the events of the original trilogy the surviving remnants of the Empire have created a new faction of tyranny. Lead by a mysterious new dark lord from the other reaches of space and bolstered by a legion of brain-washed devotees the \u201cFirst Order\u201d is an ever-present threat to the peace and liberty of the New Republic. Now old and struggling with the trauma of heartbreaking recent events the heroes of the rebellion must pass the torch to a new generation of heroes who will keep hope alive in the galaxy\u201d\nCome on that sounds great. The problem is the story that came out of it was a mess with no coherent vision.\nIf you\u2019d like an example of how, I think at least, the sequels could have been good with only minimal rewrites check out:\nPatrick Wiley's answer to How would you fix the Star Wars sequel trilogy?", "Yeah.

Study and work hard: Try learning and study as much as possible before you get to that point where you can apply for that job. If you have more knowledge than everyone else in that game like Bill Gates when he went to computer engineering, he knew everything and was ahead of the game.\n2.) Confirm if you want this job: I have a dream job and that\u2019s becoming a critically acclaimed director that made a film in more than one country in different languages. While this may be hard to do, you also got to ask yourself if you really want to sacrifice and work your way to this goal. Is this what you want? Will you enjoy it even after being forced and crammed into a political realm of hell? Entertainment Industry is politically charged with cash-grabs and clich\u00e9s. If you understand this concept and still want to work at Pixar, then you can go ahead and go for it.\n3.) Start doing some 3D animations now!: While this entire pandemic is going on, you might as well start learning on how to make this animation and how to do that. Pixar\u2019s filmography always had some type of challenge in their film (Toy Story: Vs. Computer Technology. Finding Nemo: Vs. Long Shots and the movement of the sea. Incredibles: Vs. the animation and look of a human and their hair motion most notably seen with Violet\u2019s hair.) There\u2019s always some challenge that Pixar loves to do with their movies and that\u2019s why they improve as always.\n4.) If you don\u2019t want to be an animator but instead a director, try brainstorming creative stories: All good movies must try their best to avoid clich\u00e9s. Make a film with a story nobody ever heard of. Make your film stand out on top of all the movies ever made on earth. Let it sit on a throne next to Godfather or 2001 or perhaps Citizen Kane. But, don\u2019t have big dreams because you\u2019ll feel bad in case if you fail in making a good film and you\u2019ll feel bad. Just think about making a movie that\u2019s entertaining but also bringing topics that aren\u2019t often talked about (That\u2019s not anything political or anything about saving the wildlife. That story has been told too many times by the time you release a movie). And the most difficult part after finding a theme to make a story out of: Is how do you execute this story and to add little details that people can see after repeated viewings. There you have mastered good storytelling (Not visually) and rewatchability. For visually outstanding shots, try looking at some of the best shots in film and try getting inspiration but not directly stealing or using any shots that everyone has seen before on film. Make beautiful shots that nobody has seen on film. Here\u2019s a good challenge, make every shot a painting!\n5.) Don\u2019t stress it, you need your daily dose of joy and passion: If you don\u2019t have the passion and if you\u2019re all stressed out, this job isn\u2019t for you. Just work hard and make sure to see if you still love what you want to be after a while. If you hate movies after a while, might as well give up that dream while you\u2019re still young (I assume).\nMake your dreams alive but make sure that these dreams have a healthy amount of bad truth in it. You have to understand the consequences with joining the entertainment industry.\nFor your information, I\u2019m not part of Pixar or any film business.

To try and \u201cwin back the audience\u201d he apparently trawled internet fansites for the ones to please the consumer.\nI think that last word is appropriate, personally. I've come to the conclusion Abrams not a visionary director but a rather typical example of a Hollywood producer, someone who puts forward a million dollar project not to create a work of art but to create a license to print money. Lucas was like this too even if he had a more personal stake, the direction of Episode VI was deeply influenced by his intention to make a vehicle to sell toys - who would buy a model of the Millennium Falcon if Han Solo was dead? Would Wookiees sell as plush toys?\nIf Abrams did have a vision, then it couldn't have been so special to him as to abandon it for serving a buffet of answered fan theories to please the very angry and vocal sect of the fanbase some of whom might not have even watched these movies. The initial plan was to leave progression to other directors and what he may have meant by \u201cEpisode VIII became the film I wanted to make\u201d was Rian Johnson was able to create a license to print money that wasn't an ankle-deep showcase for new merchandise.\nThe very fact Abrams would have, as executive producer for the new trilogy, greenlit Rian Johnson's script should be a hint enough that for whatever reason, Abrams liked what he saw.\nI find Star Wars is at its best when the latest entry is trying to be much more than a two hour long toy advert. Neither of the two films helmed by the legendary J.J. Abrams strike me as doing that so I find it hard to believe he had much of a vision for Johnson to ruin.\nIf anything, Abrams likely considers The Last Jedi a remarkable success - it made over four times its budget and reached the Billion Dollar Club."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Robert Hintze", "view_list": [4, 160]}, "20": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Lloyd Willey"], "question_title": "Why do people on movies who lose their memory still know how to talk and know \"complex\" words?", "topic_list": ["Talking", "Human Memory", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "351", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [2], "ans_list": ["This movie stuff makes a simple plot line, and the rare cases of this is entirely a somatic neurological response to trauma memory activation.

If you didn\u2019t like someone, you waited for them to go into an outhouse and shot them through the door.\nBill", "The Hateful Eight is a prime example:\nThe Hateful Eight opens, after Tarantino's auteur credit, on a frozen landscape reminiscent of the chillier aspects of Dr. Zhivago. In the distance, six hardy horses pulling a stage coach. A coach carrying John Ruth, Kurt Russell, a bounty hunter (bounty hunters are featured players in Tarantino westerns, despite the fact the profession did not exist. Without photographs with which to identify the wanted, it was tough to apprehend them. The technology did not exist that allowed photographs to be printed on posters, or in newspapers, assuming the villain had sat for a photo. It is how Jesse James as Mr Howard spread havoc over the land for decades. The Pinkertons and others did not know what he looked like).\nRuth was taking his prisoner, Daisy Domergue, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, to Red Rock, Wyoming to collect the bounty on her murderous head. $10,000 dollars! After 12 years on the outlaw trail of murders, bank and train robberies, Jesse James was only worth $5000. Domergue was worth roughly $250,000 in 2015 dollars. Well, no one can accuse Tarantino of being an historian. Further evidence of that fact will follow).\nRuth is armed with preCivil War ordnance. Remington 1858 \"Cattleman's Carbine\", a weapon largely forgotten and with good reason. Notoriously unreliable and inaccurate and supplanted by the Henry and Spencer repeaters and the 1866 and 1873 Winchester rifles, none of which make an appearance in this film (see, the Internet Movie Firearms Database).\nHere is where it gets good. The stage is stopped by Major Marquis Warren, Samual L. Jackson, late of the Union army and veteran of the Civil War. There is no possible way a black man of the time could rise to the rank of lieutenant, let alone to reach a majority. But, I will let that alone, but he is a remarkably well spoken for a man of the time.\nYet another bounty hunter who believes a Wanted Dead or Alive poster constitutes a death warrant, due process not withstanding. He has three, count 'em three dead candidates for accounting at, yes, Red Rock! What a place for law and order!\nThe major pays his coach fare with a letter supposedly written by Abraham Lincoln. \u201cThe president of the United States?\u201d none other.\nNext up, the newly elected sheriff of Red Rock, Walton Goggins. In my naivety I thought sheriff was an elected county office, and marshal was a city appointment. How he was elected while out in the snow covered landscape is not explained. I will leave that alone. This is becoming like a pilgrimage to Canterbury.\nA note on the highly offensive word, nigger, a word adjectively 'overused\u201d in the case of this film is an understatement. Reportedly used over sixty times, with some nonsensical explanation about racially charged times.\nBut, this film is burdened with words. The characters never stop talking. There is no dialogue, the characters make speeches. Long, dull speeches saying the same thing over and over. Tarantino is not a cinematic director. He believes in tell it, don't show it. However, he constantly moves the camera for no purpose.\nBack in the coach, we arrive at the relay station, called here, Minnie's Haberdashery (there is supposed to be a joke in there somewhere), where we encounter a congress of louts, including an ex Confederate general, Bruce Dern, still wearing his uniform in case you did not catch the dialogue.. Minnie is away, leaving Senor Bob in charge. Hmm, the Major is suspicious.\n(Note to art director: Out houses are not placed a hundred yards from the main building. The barn neither. I did not see the requisite corral for the horses, either, a standard for relay stations.)\nNow we hear a seemingly endless stream of dialogue. Tarantino fancies himself a vulgarian Noel Coward it appears. My God, talk, talk, talk.\nRuth goes paranoid and disarms a few of the louts. The general tells us he is out in Wyoming looking for his son, also a Confederate, who disappeared in the wilds. The Major confesses he captured the son, tortured and raped him (in Gore Vidal's The Best Man, the exPresident asks, \u201cIs he what we called when I was a boy, a de-generate?\u201d Yes, Mr. President, he is). The Major taunts the old man with the story of the rape, and then murders him.\nTarantino steps in with voice-over narration, explaining the action verbally because he could not do it visually. It seems one of the louts just happens to have a small vile of odorless, colorless and tasteless poison (Locusta of Ancient Rome resurrected to 19th Century Wyoming). Would a competent director use such a hackneyed story device, he would have foreshadowed it's appearance. In order to fire Chekhov's rifle on the wall, we first must see it on the wall. With Tarantino, things just pop up like frogs in a dynamite pond.\nThis chapter is titled: Goodbye John Ruth, it keeping with Tarantino's lack of visual transitions. Yes, the bounty hunter drinks the poison coffee, a caustic judging from the blood he and another throwaway character vomit up. Ruth saves his final puke for Daisy's face. Please note.\nThings get ugly (er). The Major forms an alliance with the Sheriff and gets the drop on the remaining louts. The Major threatens to shoot them, five times he tells them. Everything is stated and restated in this film. In dialogue, not visually.\nThe Major becomes Mr. Monk, or Philo Vance: this is the way it happened. Then he lays out the elements of the flashback we will see in a few minutes. The gang is there to free young Daisy, and to do so they murdered Minnie and company, and now are just waiting the chance when Ruth's guard is down to spring into action. It was the flavor of stew, clearly made by Minnie, and her dislike of Mexicans the tip-off. She would have never turned over the relay station to Senor Bob, the lone Mexican, the Major tells us. However, earlier in the day she welcomed Senior Bob along with the other louts. Well, she liked everybody.\nAnyway, the louts kill Minnie and friends, saving the old general so that he is available for the Major to murder later on.\nNear the end of the flashback we get even more narration explaining what happens. They plan the ambush, and Daisy's outlaw brother drops into a hidey-hole where he quietly remains for the first two thirds of the film. Musta been cold down there.\nIn the \u201cpresent\u201d, another round of shooting leaving only the characters with honorifics, and poor doomed Daisy, whose only discernible crime is a dirty mouth.\nSo hell, The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men Gang aft agley, and it sure did for this gang.\nSo, what's left? The Major and his minor, the Sheriff, are shot and dying, and Daisy will never make it to the gallows. Or, will she?\nLets have a party, a necktie party! With their dying breaths they hoist up Daisy by the neck to die by strangulation. They had a good laugh over that one.\nA good editor, even a poor one, could chop thirty minutes out of Hateful Eight without losing the Tarantino touch.

Compare Anakin\u2019s fighting style to Vader\u2019s and you\u2019ll seen instantly who would win. I know Obi-Wan beat Anakin and Vader beat Obi-Wan, but did he really? Obi-Wan was old, and he sacrificed himself so Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, Artoo and Threepio could escape.\nSo yes, Anakin could beat Vader", "No.\nVader is often thought of as being weaker than Anakin, but he never was.\nPeople get confused about the whole, but he was a crippled weakling thing.\nBoth are true.\nThe process of becoming Vader, the cybernetics and his lack of acceptance, his regrets over Padme, and his general apathy concerning the pursuit of power did all cripple his force abilities.\nHowever, Vader was still able to grow beyond what Anakin has been.\nHowever, because of his issues, Vader would never go on to achieve his full potential.\nThe only time we ever really saw a glimpse of Anakin\u2019s full power was when he over powered the Son and Daughter at the same time.", "Based on the limited number of comics and Darth Vader novels that I\u2019m familiar with, it seems like when Anakin\u2019s limbs got cut off, the ability the control the Force like he used to, fell away from him by a significant rate.\n\u201cAnd you rage and scream and reach through the Force to crush the shadow [Palpatine] who has destroyed you, but you are so far less now than what you were, you are more than half machine, you are like a painter gone blind, a composer gone deaf, you can remember where the power was but the power you can touch is only a memory, [\u2026] and in the end, you cannot touch the shadow [Palpatine].\u201d\n(Revenge of the Sith novelization by Matthew Stover)\nSo it\u2019s quite clear that Anakin, due to having his body intact, has a superior Force controlling ability, he is also much more acrobatic than Vader.\nHowever.\nVader has the advantage of rage (which isn\u2019t to say Anakin doesn\u2019t have rage, but it\u2019s not as ripe and developed as Vader\u2019s). Vader has been brewing in his own hatred, despair and grief for a long time, and when he decides to unleash it on an opponent it usually ends badly for them. Vader is very strong with the dark side, partly due to his tattered mental state, but also because it matches his chaotic passionate personality way better than the tranquil, sterile light side.\nVader is strong with the dark side, and Anakin is weak with the light side. The light side never truly was his. He was too hot-headed, too emotional to ever really fit into it or to make it his own, and I think that is why he felt so disconnected from the Jedi towards the end.\nA duel between Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker wouldn\u2019t be a duel between dark and light, or at least not a balanced one at that. In the Revenge of the Sith novelization I quoted above, when Dooku has his duel with Anakin he notes to himself that in the Force, Anakin\u2019s soul is like a whirling thunderstorm, his heart is like a hot furnace. He says that the boy is way too driven by emotion and passion, and he is practically half Sith already, only he doesn\u2019t realize it yet.\nGenerally, people agree that Anakin was at the height of his potential towards the end of the RoTS, just before he got turned into Darth Vader/got beaten by Obi-Wan. Would RoTS Anakin win a duel against Darth Vader? I\u2026 would say that he has a reasonable chance. But I cannot bet on him with a full heart, because despite all his Force abilities and physical strength, Darth Vader still has the advantage of his fully developed, deep dark hatred which made him very powerful.\nI definitely don\u2019t think this would be a duel between light and dark, more like a duel between a healthy and a scarred Anakin Skywalker.\nIn conclusion, I\u2019d say that it would be very interesting to watch, and I really cannot say which one of them would win.\n[Vader would probably be very confused having to fight his old beautiful self, so Anakin would have some extra emotional advantage over him, but I\u2019m not sure if this should count.]", "Anakin actually defeated Darth Vader in the end.\nI know you wanted a comparative answer but the real question would ultimately be whether Anakin could defeat himself or not.

Except that it ISN\u2019T, because under these rules I\u2019m being supported by the BBC and our Master and Commander, the naturalist David Attenborough - a bloke who ought to be world president!!!

(Though not very fast).\nLastly what about\n3. Film; Jurassic Park (whichever one) vs TV: The Clangers (Jurassic Snark)\nStrangely I seem to be drawn to kids\u2019 programmes of an originally British kind but there you go\u2026 sorry, everyone else.\nEvidently here we have small, pink, snout-nosed, animated cuddly creatures who converse in swanee-whistle language who will try to protect me from vast quantities of gibbering and rampaging dinosaurs aided by a set of \u2018scientists\u2019, journalists, token women, multi-millionaires etc who have weirdly joined forces with them in order to Dalekianly exterminate me. Looks like a foregone conclusion.\nAfter all, the Clangers are remarkably peaceful, social, likeable and weaponless and have an entirely symbiotic relationship with their Soup Dragon who sustains and nurtures them. How can the Clangers possibly ensure my survival?\nAha! They live on the Moon! And since I assume I\u2019ve been transported to Clangerland for my own safety I also assume I\u2019m able to access some kind of oxygen mix which preserves me. Possibly within a weightless goldfish bowl-like helmet. Or whatever. Moreover for many years I have possessed a fully functioning swanee whistle.\nWill the Jurassic dinos and their quisling humans also be able to breathe up here? I think not! Moreover I\u2019m pretty damn sure none of them have a whistle either.\nWhat\u2019s more we can summon up reinforcements, consisting of Wallace and Gromit and their ambivalent skiing robot-fridge.\n*\nThree potential scenarios with apologies to the OP who was asking which specific films/TV shows we\u2019d most recently been viewing and my answer then would be much less serendipitous. But then - we\u2019re all stuck indoors for a while so why not play?\nI reckon I\u2019ve survived 2 out of the three situations, though if the dinos etc also get hold of goldfish bowl oxygen helmets Scenario 3 might result in my death + Clanger genocide and, given that I\u2019ve also been bounced and crushed by the Pooh posse, if that happens there really isn\u2019t much hope for the human race.", "As I stand facing the rock group Queen (Bohemian Rhapsody), I have at my back a combined army of Vikings and Saxons under Uhtred of Babbanburg (The Last Kingdom).
