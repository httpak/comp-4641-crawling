Apparently Art wanted to record his parts in private in the studio but Paul wasn\u2019t comfortable allowing Garfunkel to take any additional liberties with his songs. Paul has often said that he didn\u2019t get enough credit for Bridge Over Troubled Water; perhaps his greatest hit featuring Art, so it\u2019s no surprise that he told Art to take a hike as he recorded Hearts & Bones. For a deeper dive, read the review by Jeff Giles: Inside Paul Simon's Commercial Slide on 'Hearts and Bones'", "It is my favorite Paul Simon solo album. However, my bias is that I am a big fan of Simon & Garfunkel, but not such a big fan of Paul Simon\u2019s solo work. I\u2019ve listened to everything Simon & Garfunkel, but not all of Paul Simon\u2019s solo work.\nWhen Paul Simon started working on Hearts and Bones it was going to be a solo album. Then he had the reunion in Central Park with Art Garfunkel in September, 1981. It was at that concert that The Late Great Johnny Ace was performed for the first time. (Unfortunately the performance was interrupted a few seconds after the lyric about the death of John Lennon by someone leaping onto the stage and yelling, \u201cPaul, I need to talk to you,\u201d before security threw him off the stage. For that reason the song made it to the video, but not the record album.)\nSimon & Garfunkel spent the next couple of years touring together, during which time they announced that the upcoming album would be their first studio album since Bridge Over Troubled Waters. The album was to be titled Think Too Much. When I saw them in concert during the summer of 1983, they performed four songs from the upcoming album. Simon performed Allergies and Late Great Johnny Ace on his own. Together they performed Think Too Much and Cars Are Cars.\nUnfortunately Simon & Garfunkel fell out again a few months later. Simon considered himself a poet of the times who liked to record his material quickly and while it was still topical. Garfunkel considered himself a perfectionist, not in any rush to put out material until it sounded perfect. Simon got fed up with how long it was taking, and wiped off all of Garfunkel\u2019s material, releasing it as the solo album Hearts & Bones.\nAlthough I was very disappointed that the new album was without Garfunkel, I bought it nevertheless. I found that the album is very much in the style of Simon & Garfunkel, more so than any of Paul Simon\u2019s other solo albums. (American Tune from a previous solo album is also very much a Simon & Garfunkel style song. Although it started out as a Paul Simon solo song, Garfunkel got to sing on it at the Central Park concert.) So I very much like the style of music of Hearts & Bones. The two songs you mentioned are particularly good. Simon\u2019s voice is very sweet on Rene and Georgette. Late Great Johnny Ace is the only one of the four songs that reference Kathy that is not a Simon & Garfunkel song. (However, although released on the Simon & Garfunkel album Sounds of Silence, Simon has always sung Kathy\u2019s Song by himself.)\nI have listened to most of Simon\u2019s solo work, and even seen him in concert once without Garfunkel. Nevertheless, Hearts & Bones is my favorite of his solo albums, followed by Songs From the Capeman."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Rick Stutzel", "view_list": [46, 60, 78]}, "276": {"no_of_follower": 0, "respond_collected": 5, "name_list": ["Dennis William Vernier", "Edward M Sousa", "Carl Scullion", "James Craik", "Lewie Docksey"], "question_title": "Would a singer like Sinatra be able to make it today?", "topic_list": ["Frank Sinatra (musician)", "Singers", "Musicians", "Music"], "no_of_view": "693", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], "ans_list": ["Not if record companies didn't think he would fit in with what they are currently producing and marketing.", "Yes.

By continuously learning, technology can extract the characteristics and the thesis of music entirely. The final AI model is then created, having the capability to compose altogether different, innovative, and unique musical pieces. Sounds cool, right? But the next AI application in the music industry will blow your mind - AI can write song lyrics too. By training the AI model with a considerable amount and type of dataset containing random lyrics and music compositions, we can obtain AI that independently generates lyrics.\nRecording a song is expensive. AI helps artists record music inexpensively. We have AI apps that record music, assisting independent artists in recording their music.\nAnother area where AI can showcase its talent in music marketing. AI can help marketers to obtain critical information on how to effectively sell a music album to the listeners. By analyzing the behavioral pattern of listeners, AI can gauge the sentiments of users and recommend them songs based on their interests.\nThe Development of AI in Music\nThe level of AI sophistication in the music industry has reached a place where we now see robots entering the mainstream music industry. We know that the potential of AI is assisting humans in the creation of audio content. But, AI is here to replace artists altogether. Did you know, robots can not only create original musical pieces but also play music? Cool, right? In the future, we might see robots performing on stage along with musicians and artists.\nTen years back, we never thought that AI will innovate the industry to an extent it is doing now.

This can be done with out learning an instrument by matching your voice to the notes on and instrument, like a piano", "No but Yes\nNo in that it is technically possible for a singer to be great with no other musical ability/skill but it is unlikely. It is rare. Normally a singer would want to understand at least the basics of their craft which means how it interfaces with the \u201cband\u201d.\nIn my experience singers who don\u2019t know the notes they are singing are not worth working with as they are likely to sing with different notes every time(!) Also when I ask for the vocal melody, they assume that is my job which is not cool at all seeing it is their song and seeing I am being paid to be the Orchestrator or Mix Engineer I am not being paid to be the Songwriter. Also if they are as out of tune as they often are, even my DAW is unsure which notes I should be moving to.\nKnow at least the basics of your craft and those around you. I know a guitar has 6 strings starting on E moving in a pattern of 4th, 4th, 4th, 3rd, 4th and that once the low E is tuned, you can fret to tune the rest - despite not being able to play a guitar in any useful fashion myself.", "Is it important? Yes. It particularly helps to be able to play piano, read music and know basic music theory. I think you are more rounded professionally if you do. Does it guarantee success? No. You still need talent.", "Almost. There are a few exceptions, but in most cases you need to be able to play some sort of instrument - with the exception that if you can hit every note perfectly and know where it is in relation to other notes, and are pitch perfect, then you are good to go. However the chances are that if you can do it that well and are that musically talented, you have already learnt an instrument anyway.\nHowever, the other exception is of course music theory. If you have an amazing knowledge of music theory then you don\u2019t need to be able to play an instrument to sing. But yet again, people with exceptional music theory knowledge tend to play an instrument.\nAlso, you will be more useful to music producers and agents if you can play instruments - more likely to get given jobs, in fact.\nSo I would strongly say yes to this.", "Yes. Important but not absolutely necessary. Playing an instrument, even at an amateurish level, greatly enhances a singer\u2019s connection to music-making. Also, you can accompany yourself as you practice singing. And who knows, maybe you\u2019ll want to be able to write songs at some point, freeing yourself from being dependent on the songwriting of others.", "Wouldn't hurt. A basic - prretty much required- if you knew your way around theory fundamentals on a piano. Singing notes from sheet music, understanding chords and inversions and things like what a 7th and a 9th are. The piano (or any keyboard instrument) is the universal center in the common sense.\nIf you wanna-be a singer/songwriter, hows does learning guitar strike you? There are some very clever songwriters. Randy Newman (toy story) does just fine as a singer songwriter on piano. Who knows? Do what works for you. Learn it all.", "Thanx for the A2A Brady. I\u2019m a musician. I can play the Guitar, Bass, Drums, Keyboards and Sing. Started out on Piano when I was around 6\u20138 years old. Hated every lesson. Regret quitting them every day now. I\u2019ve had a few guitar lessons when I was 10\u201311 too and they were just as boring as the Piano lessons. Quit them too, But I didn\u2019t give up on the guitar. I wanted to be the next Ace Frehley or Jimmy Page so I kept at it and learned on my own. Those early Piano lessons taught me one thing, basic theory. Same with the Guitar lessons, they showed me scales and key. None of which I ever used until later in my music career. When I started playing for money and publicly most of the songs I learned by ear FIRST, but I can be an anal bastard when it comes to playing other peoples material. I always seek out the sheet music, tablature or song books to check my chords, notes and phrasing. Also to see the proper tuning since there are ways to play songs written in alternate tunings in standard. Again, me trying to recreate EXACTLY how it was originally done, if it was in an alternate tuning I INSISTED the band play it that way.\nAs for vocals, I\u2019ve always contributed back up vocals in every band I\u2019ve ever gigged with and sang certain songs that were in my range and that I sounded better on. Now that I don\u2019t gig anymore, mostly due to pain issues I do LOTS of recording in my home studio. It\u2019s taken me a couple years, but it\u2019s acoustically treated and I have accumulated some excellent pro equipment (Microphones, Preamps etc.). All that pro gear does NOT make you a better vocalist. Quite the opposite, it shows every flaw more plainly. A great example is the difference between a set of $50us headphones I used to use for tracking and the pair of 250ohm ones I bought when I could afford a \u201creal\u201d set of studio headphones. They revealed all the frequencies and faux pas more clearly. I ended up going back and remixing and in some cases, re-recording entire vocal and guitar tracks. The cheap headphones didn\u2019t allow me to hear the \u201creal\u201d recording. I was thoroughly embarrassed that I shared some of those songs too. If anyone was to listen to them through a decent set of speakers/headphones, they would cringe. I may be exaggerating a bit, but it helps to make my point. Better Gear doesn\u2019t make you sound better. In my opinion you don\u2019t need to be able to play an instrument to be a good vocalist, but knowing your notes, key, scales are definitely a big help. Knowing what key the material you are singing over will help you choose the range and notes to sing over it with. It also helps to be able to tell the band or the studio session artists what key you prefer to do the piece in. If you were to get any professional vocal training, I\u2019m sure it would be part of the curriculum. IF there is any one instrument I would suggest to learn if you are insistent on the subject, I would say the Piano. Which brings us full circle here. I can play songs on the keys, just not by sight reading, but I really regret I didn\u2019t stick with those lessons way back when.", "Critical. Otherwise, they don\u2019t know where the notes are. It\u2019s that simple. The market for singers who don\u2019t know where the notes are is small and glutted. Unless you\u2019re Morrissey or have something like that going on, singing with wandery pitch isn\u2019t going to be something you can make a living at.\nSing something unaccompanied and record it. Then play the song on an instrument a few times. You don\u2019t even have to sing along; just play on it for about 20 minutes. Now sing the same bit as before and compare the two recordings. The difference will be huge.\nThe ability to accompany your own singing casts a long shadow across the rest of your musicianship. Mel Torme\u2019s vocals would never have swung as hard if he\u2019d never played drums. B. B. King would have a different singer if he didn\u2019t play guitar.\nBesides, knowing how to operate an instrument is very instructional for how to operate the vocal instrument.", "Not absolutely necessary\u2014I\u2019ve played with vocalists who had a good grasp of theory and the instruments they work with such that I felt there was no handicap. But\u2026I highly recommend that any vocalist play at least the piano or guitar (or some polyphonic instrument), which will enable them to communicate much more effectively with the musicians in their group, at recording sessions, etc. I consider it akin to speaking the language of a foreign country you intend to visit or live in\u2014kind of a \u201cduh uh,\u201d no?", "I would say, that in my opinion, that it is important.

K-pop is a group-oriented environment, so let\u2019s focus on genres that highly benefit from bands and groups. I\u2019m not just talking about rock music, you also have pop groups, R&B groups, rap groups, EDM groups and so on. Regardless of the genre, if someone is a fan of a band/group, they will have at least one member they see as their favourite.\nBias - the term itself - does have a similar meaning in the West, but outside K-pop, we don\u2019t really use \u2018bias\u2019 to describe our favourite members. Just think about how awkward it would be if you told your classmates that Quavo was your Migos bias, they may not have a clue what you\u2019re talking about. Likewise, we replace \u2018bias wrecker\u2019 with second favourite, because well, imagine how things would go down if you said Takeoff was your bias wrecker.\nSo yes, fans of other genres do have biases (and bias wreckers). It\u2019s just that \u2018bias\u2019 and \u2018bias wrecker\u2019 are simply K-pop terms used to describe favourites within groups and bands. It just comes down to how you talk about your favourites. If your friends are into K-pop as much as you are, feel free to use \u2018bias\u2019, even when referring to non-Korean groups and bands.

I just say that he\u2019s my favorite.\nAlso, a lot of K-pop fans have an established bias and bias wrecker in their favorite groups, but for me, if I\u2019m obsessed with a band then my favorite member changes a lot. For example, my whole world currently revolves around Badflower, and my favorite member usually alternates between Josh and Joey, sometimes Alex and Anthony are my favorite for a little while but it\u2019s usually Josh or Joey.\nSame with Queen and Nirvana, two of my all-time favorite bands. Sometimes I\u2019ll say I have a favorite member, but it\u2019s not set in stone.\nSo to answer your question, I\u2019m gonna say yes they do, but it\u2019s different.\nAlso, this is just rock music, I don\u2019t listen to other music, but I\u2019m assuming that fans of other, non-Korean boy bands probably have something more similar to a \u201cbias.\u201d\nI dunno how much this helped but I tried.\nRock on,\n-Quora\u2019s favorite sssssnotelek \ud83d\udc0d"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Vinny Chaparala", "view_list": [37, 76, 192, 289]}, "944": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "Why is A.R.

We excell at different things.\nThat said, I could go on for hours on why classical is better than pop, but that\u2019s another answer.", "Underestimate in what sense? There\u2019s so much that pop musicians do better than classical musicians.\nI actually feel the reverse a lot of the time. Let\u2019s talk about how many hours I\u2019ve trained in music for: obviously, I trained a lot as a kid, and then I went to college for four years in music composition and then I did two graduate degrees. Then I went and spent two more years at the Lindemann program at the Met (kind of the opera equivalent of medical residency) before starting the fancy international phase of my career just before age 30. That\u2019s a lot of years of work to put in.\nI bring this up because, when a mostly-self-taught pop guitarist takes the position \u201cwhy do classical musicians always underestimate me, we\u2019re both musicians,\u201d I often wonder what he thinks I was up to for 10 years of my life.

What I find, mostly, is that this admission is one-sided: pop musicians love to say \u201cI\u2019m classically trained,\u201d when they mean \u201cI once studied with a classical teacher,\u201d whereas classical musicians almost never say the equivalents.", "You'll notice one day that the crowd of classical musicians that underestimate non classical musicians have done nothing with their training. Their parents or they have spent an obscene amount of money on lessons and classes just so they can feel some undeserved sense of accomplishment. You see, somewhere along the way they lost the point of making music, and just got caught up in some age old processes. They are usually insecure because although they pour time, and energy into their endeavors, nobody actually cares about what they do. Most of the time, they wont be making a living off of their hard work, and so they feel cheated out of their efforts. So instead of just acknowledging that they arent that good, they pretend they are in some club. Yes, some imaginary club that you arent invited to. It makes them feel superior to you, and they mistake that feeling for accomplishment because they never actually got that feeling from their music, because the hacks that taught them have taught them to think like that. I also suspect it's a classist sort of thing as well. Your parents basically have to have some serious dough in order to pay for these classes for their untalented spoiled kids, and so their ideas about pop music being inferior are actually just a way of them saying\u2026 \u201c You are poor. You dont know anything about music. You dont even deserve to be in the conversation!\u201d I experienced this is in the world of food as well.

Beethoven already did the hard work of discovering what sounds great.\nAFAIK Beethoven wrote most of his works in a fairly timely fashion. A big chunk of his income was from selling music for publication so there wasn\u2019t an incentive to dawdle.\nA few great works may have gestated for a long time but he seems to always have had another project to turn to if he got stuck on one. I don\u2019t detect any long periods of inactivity\u2026\nList of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven - Wikipedia\nTen years elapsed between symphony 8 and symphony 9 but he did a boat load of other things in that time.\nHe has 35+ solo piano sonatas alone, that is like one for every year of his adult life. That is where a modern Beethoven imitator would fail. You could write one sonata that might be viable but could you write 35 that don\u2019t all sound way too similar?\nThe striking thing about Beethoven is he kept changing. Each symphony after the second sounds quite unlike what came before. The ninth doesn\u2019t sound like the eighth, which doesn\u2019t sound like the seventh, which doesn\u2019t sound like the sixth\u2026 And yet they do sound like Beethoven.\nThat is a real trick to keep re-inventing your style and yet keep it. This is several grades above composers like Stravinsky or Copland who ran out of gas in middle-age and began cranking out awful twelve-tone music. Or Philip Glass who has not changed in 50 years.\nOther composer were faster than Beethoven.

How could I even compare myself to such masters of their craft. It all seems easy (or easier at least) from our modern point of view, but still few can achieve that.\nThere are many things to consider. I think that a decently skilled composer with a very good theoretical background could write a symphony in the style of Beethoven in half if not a quarter of the time that it took for Beethoven himself. Does that make them as good or even better than him? Absolutely not.\nBeethoven pushed the limits of what was acceptable in his time, trying to satisfy both his artistic hunger for innovation and the expectations of the public. What today sounds standard in the past may have sounded revolutionary. Also someone today would probably be aided by computers, softwares and could have access to a huge amount information in just one click.\nThis makes it sound impossible to compose in the 1700/1800's but we have to consider the fact that many of them were following pre-made schemes (Mozart especially, which is why he was so prolific) and they were fully immersed in the aesthetical canons of their era. Beethoven probably took so long to finish his pieces because he had to completely reinvent these \u201cready-made\u201d schemes.\nBriefly, to answer your question, a skilled composer could compose a Sonata in the style of Beethoven in probably 1/2 months (just guessing), but that doesn't make him better and to be honest would be just a waste of time. You have to follow or reinvent the canons of your time, just like Beethoven did, and then MAYBE you could compare yourself to the masters of the past otherwise you'd just be a forgotten imitator.", "How \u201caverage\u201d?

You need to know difficult technical things about music - things that most pop musicians don\u2019t even know exist - and have them so completely internalized that you no longer even think about them when you\u2019re composing, so completely that it just comes out stylistically right. These are matters of form, pacing, development, and harmonic structure, and they aren\u2019t obvious or easy to learn as thoroughly as you need to learn them. Furthermore, they don\u2019t really appear in any other kind of music, at least not at that level of rigorousness.

When I realized that this was a sign of damage, I turned the volume control on my radio all the way down, totally, so that I couldn\u2019t hear any music, and noticed that I could STILL hear the internal hiss of the amplifier. I had been playing the sound louder than I really needed to, just to cover up that hiss. To fix it, I put an attenuator (at least 10 dB) in the line between my receiver and headphones, so I couldn\u2019t hear the hiss anymore. (Yes, this wastes 90% of the power coming out of the amplifier, but I don\u2019t care. It cleans up the hiss.) Now, I can hear the sounds clearly even at very low levels, and my ears are working better.\nI have three attenuators. One is a 1000:8 transformer, with the 1000-ohm side going to the receiver and the 8-ohm side to the headphones. This is actually pretty efficient, since the receiver doesn\u2019t need to pump high current through the low headphone impedance. Another is a box of pi-network resistors with bypass switches, so I can select the amount of attenuation I want. The third is an in-line stereo volume control that just splices into the line between the receiver and the headphone plug.\nOur ears, when they\u2019re working properly, can adapt to low sound levels by becoming more sensitive (just as our eyes adjust to darkness). After you put your headphones on, wait a minute or two before turning on the sound, then turn it up slowly until it\u2019s just loud enough to hear.

On the street, you would be an anomaly as the majority of people are tone-deaf. If you were to go to a conservatory, or go into the music industry, you would be just an average person. Once again, it completely depends on where you are.\nThe one thing you can do to set yourself apart from other musicians is train your ears hardcore. And by that, I mean have perfect pitch. You can hear a cello play a note, and know what it is, or hear someone setting down their glass on a table, and tell the pitch of the noise in extreme cases.\nThis is not a need, more and more people, especially high schoolers nowadays, have perfect pitch, or are training in perfect pitch.

Some pressing plants have tried different formulations using liquid dyes. You may sometimes notice that a black record is slightly transparent?

In that sense, you could say that black vinyl is better for records.", "I think black vinyl does not wear as much as color vinyl or picture disks because it is harder. I have no actual proof of that though.", "It is not the colour of the vinyl. It is its quality. And not all black vinyl sound good either. It is the quality of the vinyl (plastic) compound itself that can be questionable.\nIn a not very distant past, most produced vinyl records were quite good. Eventually, the global energy crisis imposed changes to the manufacturing process. The music industry used to rely on expensive petroleum for vinyl production. To cut costs, many labels reduced the thickness and quality of their materials and Instead of using the original better quality vinyl, they began using recycled materials. They would remove the labels from old records and the vinyl was then melted down and reused. Because of this procedure, even some bits of paper were sometimes embedded in the compound. RCA Records attempted to convince buyers this was a big innovation in vinyl production and branded these new records as Dynaflex. But the truth is that the quality of the product became worst.\nEven today, many audiophiles are convinced that 180-gram grade vinyl records provide a richer audio experience than the lighter, standard grades because of its weight. But that is not the reason. Yes, the 180g LPs may be more \u201cstable\u201d on the turntable platter thanks to their \u201cadded\u201d weight, but the truth is that the quality of the sound derives from the higher quality of the vinyl compound itself.\nColoured records are made of lower quality PVC and, they do in fact, tend not to sound as good even when compared with the lighter, standard vinyl grades. Almost without exception, coloured vinyl discs will have more noise and hiss compared to their black counterparts. Also, other steps in the production process, such as mastering and the pressing plant\u2019s quality control standards, can have a substantial impact on playback.\nPicture Discs tend to be even worst because they are typically made of 3 layers. A first layer being a clear record with no music, the second the picture layer, and the third a transparent very thin malleable plastic layer which contains the grooves. This type of record manufacturing process usually negatively affects both the playback quality and its long-term durability. But, on the other hand, it looks cool and many collectors still seek it.\nToday, most vinyl records are made of transparent PVC. Titanium dioxide and other additives are mixed in to give it a specific colour. For example, the common black colour is achieved by adding black carbon, which also strengthens the PVC compound. This is another reason why audiophiles prefer the 180g pressings because those are made with the original higher quality vinyl used in the \u201cold days\u201d.\nYou should follow the link below for the interesting history of the vinyl record throughout the years:\nPhonograph record - Wikipedia", "Some people believe that colored vinyl doesn\u2019t sound as good because vinyl is naturally translucent and the particles in the colorants distort the sound when it\u2019s played. Accordingly, most reference albums are white or translucent because of this.\nBut if there\u2019s a measurable difference, I\u2019ve never seen it. Or rather, \u201cheard\u201d it.", "I don\u2019t know if black vinyl has a different texture or if coloration can affect the quality of the tone. Back in the late 60s, there was a great album by Dave Mason, Alone Together, that was made with swirling colors and that didn\u2019t affect the quality back then. I think 5 decades record technology might have found its mark somewhere along the line.\nP.S. Look up Alone Together and give it a listen. There is a lot of great music on that album.\nDig deep and enjoy!", "How long is a piece of string? The blue and red records in my collection sound every bit as good as the best black vinyl. However, in the USA many black records over the years were manufactured from recycled vinyl \u2014 paper labels and all. They sounded as you would imagine a rough cardboard record might sound.

If you\u2019re gonna go for touch playing, that would be my suggestion.\nHere\u2019s an explanation from Emmett Chapman:\nHome of the Chapman Stick", "At least similar", "In principle, you are generally correct. It\u2019s all tapping. But what Jordan does is miraculously complex. You\u2019re aiming very high! But why not try for it? It\u2019ll be a good learning experience, and who knows \u2014 you might become very good at it.", "You\u2019d be better off studying Stanley Jordan. One other thing you should know about Jordan\u2019s approach is that s/he tunes his guitar entirely in fourths, eliminating the half-step shift between the G and B strings. This increases the symmetry of the fretboard across the strings. That might be something that you want to look into at some point if you decide to go deep into what Stanley Jordan does.", "While I don\u2019t have the most experience with electric guitars or tap, I suggest that you do start with the same way metal players tap.\nWith my limited knowledge, I can at least give you a (I forgot what the word was).\nThis is like learning to play eighth notes the classic way then learning the swing/\u201cjazz\u201d way. While I\u2019m not sure if this is your best bet, this is what I would do if I were trying to achieve the same goal.\nHappy learning!\n-Sammy", "Absolutely! Tapping like Stanley Jordan might take a few years but I am sure it will be a good technique to add to your current guitar inventory. One of the prime techniques for playing fast is playing slow and very meticulously. As you move forward you just naturally find your mark. When you train your hands to go on autopilot, you want to make sure that every move is precise. That is what separates the die hard-players from those who want to be die-hard payers. My general credo is to play at my projects as intently as I work at them.\nSometimes I get sidelined by other projects but when I sense that I am losing ground, I snap right back to business.\nI think that a jazz-based motif blended with finger tapping would be a wild ride.\nHave fun and go for the burn!\nGood luck!", "A little yes, but mostly no.\nYes, the technique of sounding individual notes by tapping is the same as metal players do, but what they do and what Jordan does are different.\nUsually metal players tap one note at a time to create arpeggios on one string or extend scalar lines.\nJordan taps whole chords and basslines with his right hand while going on contrapuntally with his right.\nIts a fairly sophisticated approach, very similar conceptually to playing piano. . .which shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise because Jordan was a piano player before starting up with guitar. A lot of the guys who play like Jordan (eg Chapman Stick players) have piano background or approach the guitar that way.\nThere are metal/rock players who do relatively sophisticated tapping. Animals as Leaders guitarist Tosin Abasi does a bit more than usual Van Halen style tapping.\nFormer Megadeth guitarist Chris Broderick (who happens to have a degree in classical guitar) does a four finger on fingerboard type tapping which is pretty involved.", "Not really. Most metal tapping is a single-note melody line that consists of scales and arpeggios. Jordan\u2019s tapping usually features a bass line, chords, and melody line that move somewhat independently of one another rhythmically, and often in opposite directions simultaneously.\nSo the individual taps are the same as far as how you make the sounds, but the musical structure is very different. Metal tapping is a lot faster, but Jordan\u2019s has a more intricate structure."], "date_list": ["Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Yaakov Hallow", "view_list": [46, 3, 4, 13, 8, 22, 45, 31]}, "901": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Anonymous"], "question_title": "Which brother/sister act started their showbiz career in \"Juvenile artists Presenting an Electric Musical Toe-Dancing Novelty\"?", "topic_list": ["Entertainment Industry", "Brothers", "Dance (activity)", "Artists and Creative Professions", "Acting", "Music Industry", "Entertainment", "Musicians", "Actors and Actresses", "Music"], "no_of_view": "704", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["Fred and Adele Astaire (born Austerlitz) started their showbiz career in 1905 in \"Juvenile Artists Presenting an Electric Musical Toe-Dancing Novelty\"."], "date_list": ["Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Jaime Almodovar", "view_list": [8]}, "232": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What is the background music in age of empires 2 in standard game menu?", "topic_list": ["Age of Empires (1997 game)", "Age of Empires II (1999 game)", "Background Music", "Song Identification", "PC Gaming", "Games", "Video Games", "Music"], "no_of_view": "77", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Jats Shetty", "view_list": []}, "301": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["Betty Draper", "Rokko Jans"], "question_title": "How long does it take to learn mucial ear training?", "topic_list": ["Ear Training", "Learning Music", "Learning New Things", "Learning to Program", "Music"], "no_of_view": "272", "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "ans_list": ["its not something you learn you are born with a natural ear to play, ear training is learned with much practice but difficult to grasp.", "Please rewrite your question; are you asking how long it takes to train the muscles in your ears?\nI am not sure that everyone can learn to wiggle their ears\u2026"], "date_list": ["Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Bhavin Patel", "view_list": [11, 12]}, "334": {"no_of_follower": 0, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "error", "topic_list": ["error"], "no_of_view": 0, "create_time": "", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "", "view_list": []}, "601": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "How historically common is call and response singing in British music?", "topic_list": ["Singing", "Music"], "no_of_view": "111", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Vineeth Bharadwaj", "view_list": []}, "382": {"no_of_follower": 0, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Sandeep Singh"], "question_title": "What is the raga classification in Hindustani music?", "topic_list": ["Ragas", "Hindustani Classical Music", "Indian Classical Music", "Indian Music", "Classical Music", "Music"], "no_of_view": "246", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["Raags are classified in ten thaats.\nEach thaat has a combination of 12 notes"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Gowseyia Rahi", "view_list": [2]}, "962": {"no_of_follower": 2, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Aquamarine Crystalline"], "question_title": "Can somebody list all of Stray Kids' comebacks/albums and some other Stray Kids songs that are important to Stays (such as 3racha's songs)?", "topic_list": ["Stray Kids", "K-Pop", "Songs", "Music"], "no_of_view": "395", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [1], "ans_list": ["This should help~!

The rights to them are owned by the music label. That has been the typical way the music business works: the record company builds its value by investing in artists - promoting them, financing their recordings, arranging production, arranging tours, etc. - and in exchange one thing they get in return is ownership of the material made. That is not different from what happens in most companies when you create something for the company: you are working essentially on their dime, so what you make is owned by them. Companies have sued people saying they developed this or that product on company time, so the company owns at least a portion of that work.\nVisual artists face a similar problem: they make something on commission, and then it becomes more valuable, and is resold, but the artist gets nothing of the increase in value. It\u2019s been a problem with galleries: they may finance an artist, advancing money for example, on future sales, and then locking in work at a price so anything above that level goes only to the gallery. People do things for money. The old saying in more complete form is not that money is the root of all evil but that love of money is the root of all evil. It\u2019s a version of power corrupts.\nThe record label apparently offered a deal: Taylor could obtain ownership of old material by delivering new material. That was an attempt to persuade Taylor to sign a new contract. I don\u2019t pretend to understand the intricacies of the music business, but I know contract negotiations. Record companies build value to be sold to larger record companies. That\u2019s how you cash out: you either get sold or you buy others and get bigger. There is a simple reason: your business relies on acts, meaning performers, that have cycles of popularity. There are exceptions: some labels have, for example, specialized in relatively low return issues of smaller scale or historical acts. The same is true of publishers: there are some publishers that have existed - don\u2019t know about today - making relatively small money off a handful of perennial sellers that allow them to issue some other relatively small sellers. And of course, many labels (like publishers) remain small because they never happen to obtain or discover an act like Taylor Swift.\nIn negotiating terms, since that is what I know, signing Taylor to a new deal would make the record label much more valuable to its owners. Otherwise, the main assets of the company are and would be the records that Taylor made \u2018for\u2019 that company. I\u2019m not sure why they offered a path to ownership which required a new record to release ownership of an old record. In negotiations, that to me would signal something bad: why not give Taylor everything right away in exchange for a new contract? Why not agree with Taylor that the ownership would only be sold with Taylor\u2019s approval? I have no idea what occurred, but the sensible thing for the record company to me as a negotiator would have been to say: we want to sell you and we need you because you\u2019re the value here. Again, people tend to lose their way when money is involved.\nInstead, they sold the record company to someone Taylor would not approve. But they seem to have received a lot for it, so that path seems to have worked for them. I say \u2018seemed\u2019 because they apparently either were unaware or lost track of the fact that Taylor has the contractual right to re-record the old music later in 2020. Unless there is a claw-back, the new owners either made a valuation mistake or they decided to take the risk anyway. It\u2019s hard to tell because that requires knowing the financing terms. A claw-back is what it sounds like: it\u2019s relatively common for deals to include a re-evaluation of the price based on economic performance.\nI note that Taylor\u2019s cooperation has real economic value. For example, built into copyright is that rights holders have to be \u2018cleared\u2019 for use in a commercial. Or a movie. That\u2019s an income stream you don\u2019t get if you don\u2019t have a cooperative relationship.\nI also note that Prince fought a version of this battle. And John Fogerty fought a version of this battle too: refusing to play Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for a decade or more. (I heard John on the radio say he was at Robert Johnson\u2019s grave in Mississippi when he found himself wondering who owns the songs.) John was so screwed by his label that they actually put another name on as songwriter alongside his, so he has had to share the money he has made as the songwriter with someone who had no role in songwriting. The Beatles dealt with this: Only A Northern Song is a toss-off written by George to fulfill their legal obligation to Northern Songs, which they hated for a variety of reasons, including that their music rights were sold without their permission.\nThe music business has never been particularly nice to artists. They\u2019ve largely followed the model of the movie business, which is famous for accounting practices that make many economic interests a joke: you get paid above a line or you never get paid because big hits never make money below that accounting line. Artists would find not only were the labels lying to them about how many records were sold, literally cheating on royalty statements, but that they were charged exorbitant rates for studio time, for the cost of tour support, etc., all plus interest, so they\u2019d owe the record company money after producing a hit. The record labels would justify this by saying an act might produce a hit, but would rarely produce a string of hits where the power relationship would shift."], "date_list": ["Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Jose Abarca", "view_list": [118]}, "519": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What are some similar songs to \u201cYes I Know\u201d by The Pack A.D.?

I was a vocalist, using the guitar for rhythm. I was a pretty good player, using only a pick, and had a adequate chord vocabulary.

But I felt I had no where to go and everything was just the same O same O and boring. I decided to do or die with my playing. I determined that for one year, I would play nothing that I had learned before, that I no longer could use a pick, and I needed to play both lead (as in voice) and back up rhythm simultaneously. Also, I wanted to expand my chord knowledge on extended chords and different inversions. Quite a plateful. I made a list of ten songs I wanted to do and dug in. The only song that was from the \u2018old\u2019 me was Country Roads, but now I had to substitute notes for my voice. To shorten this up, the beginning was frustrating and slow going. Fingerstyle was like a foreign language. But eventually I nailed it down pretty good, and with all the practice and song learning I reached the level where I can learn a new song more quickly and better. I have a large repertoire of songs now and can play for hours without any repeats. I always felt that if people were listening to me, they would rather hear songs, preferably ones they\u2019re familiar with, than listen to me play a mess of licks, and riffs, and speed drills. I know if I\u2019m listening to someone play, its\u2019 a complete song, done with excellence that hold me glued. Go to YouTube and pull up Gabriella Quevedo and listen to her play. This is my style, although she is better than me. But that doesn\u2019t deter me. She\u2019s fantastic and inspires me to get better. What makes us better? Practice and more Practice.

Freebird was a track I learnt on the guitar back when I was first playing and was one of the first and only pieces of slide guitar I\u2019ve ever practised.\nWhen cover bands gig it\u2019s pretty common for people to ask for their favourite song in the interval. In fact ones pretty common for people to cone up to and start chatting about this while you\u2019re playing, which is really annoying - don\u2019t do it.\nMost people who don\u2019t play instruments seem to have little understanding of how things work. Some seem to think that every musician knows every song by heart.\nI remember about 15 years ago being asked to play Bring Me to Life by Evanescence at a gig. I apologised and said we didn\u2019t know it. \u201cReally?\u201d said the punter. \u201cYou\u2019ve never heard it? It was huge a couple of years back!\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve heard it. I just don\u2019t know how to play it,\u201d I replied.\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Punter. \u201cDo you think you could give it a go?\u201d\nLikewise, a band I was in who specialised in doing 90s Britpop were asked often to play perennial favourites from the 70s, like The Boys Are Back In Town, which - although a great song - didn\u2019t fit our set at all.\nBands spend a long time rehearsing and deciding their set and image. Punters turn up at a gig and want their favourite song. Sometimes the two things don\u2019t tally.\nWhich brings me to Freebird. It was a popular song in the 70s and an audience of people who like American guitar-based 70s rock will know it. Most of these will be people in the 50s snd 60s so if that is your audience they may well want to hear tracks like that.\nReading comments on the Facebook group there are tracks that repeatedly get asked for at gigs, but these seem to vary depending on the country. Many American bands moan about the repetition of playing Wagon Wheel because people request it. I\u2019ve never heard the track and only know if its existence through these Facebook groups. As a British person playing in groups I have never been asked to play Freebird. Not even as a joke. I have never seen a cover band play it in the U.K. I\u2019m sure many do, but I\u2019ve never seen it. I have seen several bands do Sweet Home Alabama, and have gigged it several times, but never Freebird.\nNow, if you\u2019d asked me about Wonderwall, that would be a different answer.", "Ita a kool and great song.

This is one of the biggest unsung obstacles all musicians face, in my case it's the guitar, but when I played piano primarily, it was there too.\nTension in the hands playing fast pieces is a double edged sword, firstly it is a physical hurdle, strength and fitness that needs to be developed, and the best way to develop that is simply by playing fast alot, but never sacrifice correct technique and musicality for speed. If you cant play it right fast, bring it back a notch til it's right and then get it up to speed again. To play fast, you just have to play fast. Don't buy into the age old myth that \u201cif you can play it slow, you can play it fast\" no. The mechanics of your muscles works very differently at speed.\nOk the other big tension-maker is your psychology. When you play faster, you tense up. More than is necessary. We all do that til we overcome it. To overcome it, firstly you need to know the music intimately, that you dont have to worry about playing the righ notes. Stressing about a possible mistake popping up any second will tense you up. Get that right first.\nLearn to relax your hand beyond what it is at rest. If full tension is level 10, and your resting state is 5, practise getting it relaxed down to below 5 when you're watching TV or whatever. Then when you play again, use that same process while you are playing. That will help bring it to a more manageable tension. It takes time though. You're physically changing the musculature of your hand as well as your psychological state. It doesn't happen fast, but the progress is noticeable as you go so dont give up.

It is also considered as MJ\u2019s tribute to soul singer Mavis Staples, who used the word, \u201cshamone\u201d in a live version of \u201cI\u2019ll Take You There\u201d in 1975.\u201d\nHe has 23 Guinness World Records, 40 Billboard Awards, 13 Grammys, and 26 American Music Awards.

Having the chord root as the lowest note can be useful for beginning guitarists. Because the root note is the main anchor for a chord, a beginner guitarist has a good take on understanding a chord\u2019s purpose. When I studied composition, my mentor had me use the root as the lowest tone. The result was a secure means for following up on chord variations.\nMy mentor stated that the 5th is another good option for the lowest chord also. The root and 5th notes can be swapped out for each other as the lowest chord tone. They can also be used anywhere in a chord form (watch out for b9s and misplaced tritones).\nThe root and 5th tones help to create variations in the chord progression\u2019s sound and they support the other chord tones. The root and 5th chord tone alterations can create a bass line as the chord\u2019s move through the progressions.\nHere are a few guidelines that help a beginner\u2019s to design chord forms using the key of C major. There are 7 different notes in the scale, adding the 8th note creates a range of an octave. The octave is a convenient package for each of the modes.\nThe notes of the C major scale are 1C, 2D, 3E, 4F, 5G, 6A, 7B, and 8C to round the sound of the scale. The 3rd chord determines whether the chord is a major or minor chord, the 7th tone determines whether the chord is a major 7th tone or a minor 7th chord. The 3rd and 7th tones of a chord are called guide tones, they bring out the character of the chord. You can play the chord as a triad or a 7th chord.\nEach note of a major scale can create an inner scale called a mode. The modes are offset scales within the major chord form.\nRoman numerals are used to show the order of the modes. Arabic numerals are used to define the order of the notes within the modes. This might sound complicated but it is not complicated. I am including the mode names also. You don\u2019t have to use them right now but you should learn them a some point. Passing tones are shown in parentheses. Here is the format!\nI 1C, 2D, 3E, 4F, 5G, 6A, 7B, 8C / C maj7 / Ionian (4)\nII 1D, 2E, 3F, 4G, 5A, 6B, 7C, 8D / D min7 / Dorian (6)\nIII 1E, 2F, 3G, 4A, 5B, 6C, 7D , 8E / E min7 / Phrygian (2)\nIV 1F, 2G, 3A, 4B, 5C, 6D, 7E, 8F / F maj7 / Lydian (0)\nV 1G, 2A, 3B, 4C, 5D, 6E, 7F, 8G / G7 (dom7) / Mixolydian (4)\nVI 1A, 2B, 3C, 4D, 5E, 6F, 7G, 8A / A min7 / Aeolian (6)\nVII 1B, 2C, 3D, 4E, 5F, 6G, 7A, 8B / B-7b5 / Locrian (2)\nVIII 1C, 2D, 3E, 4F, 5G, 6A, 7B, 8C / Cmaj7 / Ionian (4)\nEach note in these diagrams fallS into place as the note shift into their place.\nYou can see the 1 root note and 5th note for each chord.\nThe chord tones are 1, 3, 5, and 7. The 2, 4, and 6th tones are called tensions, they are good for enhancing the chord\u2019s sound. Use tensions carefully so they don\u2019t collide with the chord tones, experiment and you will see why. The passing tones are shown in parentheses for each mode. The passing tones are notes the can cause conflict in a chord form but they are useful for connecting the dots to important notes in a melody.\nAs to your question regarding the lowest chord tone, you can use inversions of the chord to place the chord tones in the low spot. The inversions are created by using different chord tones in the bass. Consider how your inversions can be compatible when working with other musicians. You might have to tweak a few notes here and there as needed.\nI hope this is useful to you!", "Not always but it\u2019s a common practice.", "Nope.\nAny note in the chord can be the lowest note.\nAnd when other notes are lower, the chord is in an inversion.", "No, it isn\u2019t. Very often the chord is inverted, which means the root of the chord has either moved up or some other note has shifted down to follow the bass line, becoming the new lowest note.\nIn thoroughbass, or figured bass, there is a mildly complicated computational protocol for defining the chord as indicated by the bass note regardless of its identity (whether or not it\u2019s the root), but depending on its relation to the root.\nIn common bass part writing, we simply indicate the bass note under the guitar chord, but this is only when the bass note is NOT the root. When it is, the bass note is simply the name of the root."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Som Dutt", "view_list": [28, 2, 1, 68, 2, 11, 50]}, "575": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What Blackpink songs have swear words in it?", "topic_list": ["BLACKPINK", "Profanity", "K-Pop", "Songs", "Music"], "no_of_view": "140", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Violet Warwood", "view_list": []}, "983": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Jeremy Klink"], "question_title": "Can you sell songs made in GarageBand?", "topic_list": ["GarageBand (iOS/OS X app)", "Songs", "Music"], "no_of_view": "278", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["Yep, you can sell songs made on anything provided you don\u2019t use copy righten loops or samples.

The event organizer made a mistake. He was told not to have BTS and Blackpink at once to prevent anything going too rough, but he misheard it to not have them at all. That, however, didn't solve the problem completely.\nThe concert was held in Emirates Stadium, the only home of Arsenal FC, Sven's favourite football club.\nSven woke up at 10am after partying with Aspry Wright at a nearby pub till drop. Sven received 34 missed calls from Aurora Wang who got mad at him for not picking her up. Sven immediately rushed from Aspry's apartment in West London, but his Nissan Skyline GT-R got a flat tire.\nNot long after, a Bentley Mulsanne stopped in front of Sven. A wealthy young lady came out of the car and it turned out to be User-11223990783437714764. Knowing her friend was in trouble, Kaitlyn told her chauffeur to take care of Sven's Skyline and drove the Mulsanne herself. The duo arrived at Chenxi's apartment in South London after going through the heavy traffic.\nIn the apartment, Chenxi was playing Scrabble with Joy Wang. After the Chinese duo lectured Sven for getting drunk the night before which led to him waking up late, the four of them went to North London to watch the event. Sven gang is rolling again!!\nDay6's stage would start at 13:00 and they were still in South London at 12:00\nKaitlyn :\nJoy :\nKaitlyn channelled her inner Michael Schumacher and arrived in time. The girls rushed inside, meanwhile Sven tried to call Aspry.\n\u201cCome on old man, where the hell are you?\u201d\nAspry showed up with his boy Jordan Lubus and apologized for getting drunk the night before.\n\u201cSven, sorry for last night. I didn't wake up until my boy Jordan broke into my apartment and poured a bucket of cold water on me. When's GFRIEND showing up?\u201d\n\u201cRight after Twice. But f*ck this shit I'm watching Twice too.\u201d\nSuddenly.. Sven saw his Skyline arriving at the parking lot.\nYeon Park and Favor Mulalira came out of the car. It was revealed that Eshaan owns a workshop in Central London and Kaitlyn's chauffeur took Sven's Skyline to Eshaan's place. Kaitlyn gave the permission for her chauffeur to go home. Meni K. Roberts and Chris Wilson showed up not long after, riding Harley Davidsons, still dressed in their denim jacket and jeans.\nSven, Aspry, Jordan, Eshaan, Favor, Christopher, and Meni came inside. Meni was lucky enough not to miss EXO's stage, as he thought EXO would show up after Red Velvet, which came after Day6. EXO came right after Day6 and Meni quickly split from the group and took his place.\nKaitlyn was looking rather pissed as Joy, who stood next to her, grabbed Dowoon's drumsticks as the maknae threw it towards the audience. The 5\u20326\u2033 Joy easily outreached the 5\u20323\u2033 Kaitlyn. However, she had no reason to be pissed as EXO were coming on. Sven took his place next to Chenxi and watched the whole EXO performance.\nSven was about to get out and smoke a fag, however Chenxi and Joy restrained him. In the end, Sven kept on jamming to Tempo. Meni and Kaitlyn had the one moment of their lifetimes, thank God they were able to survive an entire EXO performance.\nDuring EXID's stage, Eshaan got involved in a fight with several trolls as they were trying to shoot Hani from an inappropriate angle. As a true Leggo, Eshaan couldn't hold it anymore and confronted the trolls. Eshaan and several Leggos got ejected from the venue. A huge fight broke out between the Leggos led by Eshaan and the trolls. The Leggos won, but Eshaan and the remaining Leggos got arrested.\nMamamoo came up next after EXID. Favor panicked as Eshaan hadn't returned to his place, but she had no time to panic as Wheein was literally two metres away from her. This time, Favor passed out as Hwasa was moving towards her and they had an eye contact. At the end of Mamamoo's stage, Hwasa grabbed the mic and said..\n\u201cUnfortunately, the young soldier had fallen. Get well soon to the dedicated fan who brought that big ass poster. She's a good girl. Tell her Hyejin loves her!!\u201d\nTwice's turn to show up. The attention turned to Aspry, Jordan, Edison, and Vincent, the last two names who weren't seen in the beginning. When Mina started with 'Hey Boy', the fanboys were still going strong. Two songs later, Cheer Up came out. As expected from the Sana fanboys, they couldn't resist Sana's 'Shy Shy Shy'. Edison fainted, Jordan wet his pants, Aspry acted all tough while drooling, Vincent shouted uncontrollably and accidentally smashed his Candy Bong into the nearby security guard. Vincent also got ejected from the venue, but fortunately didn't get arrested for an 'attempted assault'. Edison joined Favor in the medical room while Jordan had to go to Arsenal's official store to buy a new set of pants.\nGFRIEND appeared right after Twice, and fans could see Sana giving Eunha a high five near the back of the stage. They started with Fever, Sven and Chenxi weren't impressed, but still chanted the loudest among all the audiences. Sven kept on shouting Sowon's name and finally Sowon noticed him. Sowon gave Sven a heart sign and he ended up like Aspry. Chenxi tried her best not to break down, but she joined Sven drooling after Eunha winked during Navillera. However, Sven spotted a group of trolls bringing another group's lightstick despite their group weren't attending and it angered him greatly.\nKaitlyn was at the toilet and Meni went outside to smoke, so Joy had to take care of Sven and Chenxi because GFRIEND's performance made them weak.\nRed Velvet were the last group and when Chenxi thought she couldn't bear it anymore, Seulgi disagreed. Finally, both Sven and Chenxi passed out after Irene and Seulgi respectively slayed them. Joy was the unlucky person to have Sven fall on her, and was knocked down as well. Kaitlyn returned and was terrified to see Sven, Chenxi, and Joy all laying on the ground. Kaitlyn took Chenxi's lightstick and became a Reveluv for the night.\nAs they exit the venue, Sven and Chenxi bumped into the trolls mentioned earlier. The trolls confronted them and shouted insults at GFRIEND. Enraged, the duo were about to throw hands, Sven even pulled out a crowbar from his Skyline.\nJoy fled from the exit gate while Kaitlyn, Aspry, and Meni tried to make peace. The trolls left after Christopher showed up, pulled out a fake police badge and threatened to arrest them.\nIt was a chaotic concert, but a pleasant experience for them, especially Sven.", "It's a beautiful day in America.\nThings start out early around 11am. 3YE opens things up to a small crowd. Shame too, because they rocked it and barely anyone saw it. Maybe in time people will come to appreciate them more. Next up was Pink Fantasy. I missed it because I woke up at noon.

I see Sven Alexanderson and we start arguing about who would win in a steel cage fight between Dahyun and Umji. Meni K. Roberts comes over, excited because EXO is taking the stage, and tells us to hurry so we'll all get a good spot. But then some hot woman and her daughter walk by and me and Sven follow them instead.\nEXO killed it. I guess. I don't know, I was talking to that woman. Then I hear the open for \u201cUp & Down\u201d and see Hani onstage gyrating. She's up there with some other women too. Idk, I only see Hani. And security is dragging off some dude who was trying to storm the stage! Oh shit, that's Yeon Park! He has candy and flowers in his hand, wearing an EXID t-shirt. Poor bastard\u2026\nCrystal Simpson is there with lots of goodies. She walks the crowd, sharing them with everyone. Awwww!!!!\nI see Sven with that girl again. They seem to be getting along well. Gfriend emerges and introduces themselves. I look back and Sven had just left that young girl high and dry. She stands there looking insulted while he bumrushes his way to the front of the stage, ogling Sowon. The water he was drinking spills from his mouth.\nNo wait\u2026that's drool. Aurora Wang goes over to him with a handful of towels. She's so nice - always planning ahead. But then \u201cFever\" comes on and she starts slobbing too. Those towels didn't stand a damn chance\u2026\nJordan Lubus walks over looking pissed. \u201cYou were supposed to buy my ticket!

She and Eshaan sit in the back of a squad car.\nFavor: \u201cYou're really hairy.\u201d\nEshaan: \u201cYeah\u2026I know.\u201d\nTWICE!!!! I stand calmly at the very back of the crowd as all 9 make it to the stage. By sheer force of will, I make my feet leave the ground and hover above the audience like a Jedi using the force. My heart swells, pumping the superpower of love and I slowly fly closer to the front. I gently let myself down as onlookers point at me in awe. \u201cWhere's Sana?\u201d Ah\u2026there she is. And Mina too. \u201cHeart Shaker\" indeed.\nNicole Paige and Divya Nair are seen off to the side while Chris Wilson talks politics and asks them how old they are.

Then, the jumbo-tron pumps in a news feed! It's a mugshot of some Lithuanian woman looking all crazy. The police have apprehended Jo Sosna for hijacking BTS' van!

I\u2019ve been with them since their debut in 2013, and I just fell in love with their songs. They don\u2019t stick to one rhythm, actually. They have Hip Hop, Ballad, Electronic and EDM and such. Their songs not just about their fans, or about the world, or the popularity around them; they talk about themselves and how deeply they expressed it through the lyrics. I assume you know that 90% of their songs were composed by them especially RM and Suga. The lyrics, also they made it too! The lyrics, if you read it, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a deeper meaning to it. Apart from their music, their personalities. They don\u2019t act or pretend to be like handsome or cute idols, and pretending to be cool(But they always act as if they are okay and pretend as if nothing hurts them when haters got them to their lowest point of life. This makes me sad). They\u2019re being themselves. Being goofy and the staff doesn\u2019t really care about it. They made home videos about them being goofy, without cuts! So, BTS is what i should say; a rare and special K-Pop group. Their beauty, their songs, their personalities; it\u2019s all original! That\u2019s why it hurts me inside and makes me mad to see them being hate just because of their songs \u2018cuz I mean, come on!!! They do that for a living, and they\u2019re artist, entertainers\u2026 Not just some street-joker or clowns! Don\u2019t make fool of them.", "As an ARMY, I don\u2019t love the members only because of their visuals or because of their unique style of music, but also because of the important messages they convey to the people. Those messages are hidden behind their lyrics, and we have to interpret them to understand their meaning.\nHere, \u201c people \u201d doesn\u2019t only refer to the youth, but also to people of all generations. They taught us to Love Ourself and Speak Ourself,to respect our parents and elders, and to do what we feel is right regardless of the opinions of others. Not only that, they know that some of the students who are the \u201cyouth\u201d have become so obsessive with their music that they aren\u2019t studying properly, so in one of their songs \u201cPied Piper\u201d they ask the students to stop interpreting their lyrics and go and study first.\nSome of their songs throw light on their struggles before joing the group, and how they made Bangtan what it is today- the greatest k-pop boy band in the world. Their music \u201cinsfire\u201d(its inspire anyways) us to become a good human beings and to do something good in life. Just because they\u2019re stars and won many prestigious awards in the music industry, they didn\u2019t become proud and arrogant like most of the celebrities. They are still those humble and kind human beings what they actually were before and during their fame. For each and everything, they thank their parents and ARMYs.\nThere were many instances in which they started crying on stage if they were sick and couldn\u2019t perform properly for the ARMYs, or they saw their parents in the crowd and became emotional. Once they even distributed pizzas(I think it was in America) to all those who were camping in the roadside all day just for their concert. Be it their birthdays or as a relief of any natural calamity, they don\u2019t even think before and donate to the needy ones from their heart. Once the band\u2019s leader RM had even injured his foot, which was very painful and he couldn\u2019t even walk properly, but still he did not want to dissapoint the ARMYs who took so much trouble in getting tickets for their concert, so he performed for them with his cute smile and \u2018illegal\u201d dimples (My hearteu is\u2026OMG), and the ARMYs did not even come to know how much pain he had. The members are even sad because they\u2019re not being able to perfor for their beloved ARMYs because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and their Map of the Soul tours are cancelled. Now anyone give me a \u201cvalid reason\u201d for not to love them\u2026.there are many more instances such, which are not possible for me to write all of them, so I suggest you all to check them out in google.(if you\u2019re interested)\nWith best wishes,\nARMY.\n-Hwaiting !!!", "I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re asking this because there are a lot of people who started becoming fans because BTS are all just very handsome and just famous over all so they developed their opinions based on other opinions. That was a very long sentence and probably very confusing, but\u2026 whatever. There are a lot of people who just like them for being handsome and popular, but for me, no. I wasn\u2019t a fan at all at first. I was being very prejudice about it because people kept making fun of their music. I found myself being very close-minded. I actually found out I really liked their music because of some prank I did. It was stupid, but I definitely think it was worth it in the end.\nIt was in 2018. I know, not that long ago. I\u2019m not a very impressive ARMY, but whatever. I love them now and that\u2019s all that matters. My friends Mikaila and Mariloo were trying to make me fans before this, but it didn\u2019t work because I was too prejudice. Anyway, in 2018 I went to visit my cousin in Kansas. My step sister, Adora, and I found out our cousin, Merci, was a huge fan of BTS. Adora and I were thinking it would be funny to pull a prank and say that one of us was a huge fan too. It ended up being me because Adora didn\u2019t want to have to listen to their music. She was also being prejudice, and she is also kind of bossy. I was like, okay I\u2019ll do it.\nI didn\u2019t want to be a complete moron when Merci was talking about their songs and literally have no idea what she meant when she said Magic Shop or something. Otherwise it would\u2019ve been really obvious I\u2019m not actually a fan. I would make the excuse of, I\u2019m new, if I didn\u2019t completely understand something. I know, ew, it\u2019s the most stupid excuse.\nSo, I decided I would go on Spotify, search them up, and listen to a few songs. I ended up really liking the first couple of songs, so, I kept listening. I didn\u2019t know anything about the band, I just listened to their songs. Their songs just kept getting better and better. I don\u2019t know the first song I\u2019ve ever listened to. I think it was either Blood, Sweat, and Tears, or Mic Drop. I know, basic. Anyway, I just listened. I listened to music a lot, so, even though it was in a different language, I still somehow, understood it.\nLike the first time I listened to House of Cards, I didn\u2019t know anything they were saying except for when they sang their minor English parts, I still understood there was some type of relationship with a girl. I actually thought that it was probably some on and off relationship. I was actually right. I was quite surprised when I found out some 3 months later. I didn\u2019t really find it sexy at first like a lot of international ARMYs did. I eventually did find it pretty sexy sounding, but I still understand the meaning and it is a beautiful song.\nAnother example is when I listened to Dionysus. It clearly had something to do with parties and drinking because, well, \u201cone drink, *one shot* two drinks, *two shots*!\u201d Also, the title just gives it away. Dionysus is the Greek God of partying. I knew the meaning had to be deeper though. My cousin Merci was trying to \u201chelp\u201d me understand BTS as I was still a \u201cnew fan,\u201d and made it clear that BTS\u2019s concepts are very deep. While I was listening to it I was trying to figure out the deeper meaning. I listened to it on repeat because one, it\u2019s a dope song, two, I really wanted to understand. I\u2019m someone that when is interested in something I try to figure out as much as I can on my own thinking and then would research everything I could find about the topic. I decided I just want to think though, because works of art in word form are meant to be uncovered by what the reader/listener has in mind. Anyway, I was sitting in the car listening to it on repeat while thinking about it and suddenly it just kind of clicked to me. Maybe it wasn\u2019t just something about partying. Maybe it had something to do with the fans, or maybe even the people who hate on them. Maybe because they are meant to be portrayed as perfect that people will hate them because drinking doesn\u2019t exactly look clean. Even thought they are grown adults.\nOne more example is Pied Piper. OMG I LOVE THE SONG! The second time I listened to it I was very disturbed though. The first time I just listened to the instrumental part of it not fully paying attention to the lyrics because, well, it\u2019s a bop. It reminded me of feeling like I was in Wonderland. It just had that sound to it. I love Alice in Wonderland by the way. Anyway, I listened to it again afterwards because if you really want to know a song, listen to the words. I then heard the words, I\u2019m taking over you, I was like, woah there buddy. I was just thinking, now what in the Heaven\u2019s does that mean. You ain\u2019t taking over me I barely know who you are still. Then I was thinking about other fans. I was thinking, well, I know some fans can be a little obsessive, or like to watch a bunch of funny videos of them a lot instead of doing schoolwork, or something like that. I mean, I definitely don\u2019t like doing schoolwork, I would definitely much rather watch something that would make me laugh. Then I was thinking, maybe that\u2019s what that means. Maybe it means that we are taking away your time for important things and make your life a mess. That\u2019s what they did to Mikaila and Mariloo. I was just thinking, wow. They knew it would happen, but they feel bad for doing it. I guessed it was kind of their message to try not to let them take over you? I was pretty much right. Not entirely but it is a pretty good guess for not understanding half of what they\u2019re saying. \ud83d\ude02\nNow obviously I watched some videos related to BTS because I needed to watch witch Merci to make the \u201cprank\u201d believable. At some point it wasn\u2019t even a prank, I genuinely liked them. Adora didn\u2019t know that I genuinely liked them yet, I just acted to her as if I still didn\u2019t and it was still a prank on Merci. I genuinely found them really funny though and my favorite part was their music. I didn\u2019t know their names yet, but still, I loved them. Plus it was only for a week I started liking them.\nAfter those few examples of how I love them because of their music, let\u2019s continue talking about their music overall.\nMost of their music is deep, some not so much because it can just be dissing the haters, but, we love our savage Kings. Even those can be kind of deep though. Also it\u2019s just all very calming. The only songs I can really say aren\u2019t that deep is War of Hormones and\u2026 my personal favorite\u2026 Expensive Girl. Also, the song Do You doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. Like, can someone explain what it even just means in general? Like it definitely isn\u2019t deep but what the frickity frack does it mean?\nSo, just to answer your question in short, yes. I do like them most because of their music, but I also definitely watch videos because these seven dorks who when are together are BTS are just really funny. I love them a lot. I appreciate their music and all their hard work and these seven boys deserve all the love in the world.\nEven if you don\u2019t like their music though, please respect them. They are hard working people. You don\u2019t need to waste your time hating on something or somebody. For some people, BTS are the only people that make them feel loved. Don\u2019t hurt BTS just because you can. It\u2019s mean and it just says that you don\u2019t have a life and so you\u2019re just going to waste your life away hating on something/somebody because you need something to do to just waste your time. We don\u2019t have all the time in the world, don\u2019t hate with the little time you have. It\u2019s pointless and won\u2019t do you any good. That doesn\u2019t just go for BTS. Don\u2019t just hate something because you can. If you really hate something that bad, have a good reason. For example, if you hate someone because they bully you, then okay. If you hate somebody or something that have nothing to do with your life, stop. It\u2019s pointless. It doesn\u2019t help anyone. If you really hate them though and you have a reason, please just keep it to yourself, you don\u2019t need to go online and start drama for no reason. It won\u2019t benefit you and will just make you come across as rude. Respect others. Love others and most importantly love yourself.

After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name Katy Perry and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.\nPerry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, One of the Boys, a pop-rock record containing the singles \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold\". The former track also sparked controversy for its themes of lesbianism. Her third album, Teenage Dream (2010), ventured into disco and was her first record to top the U.S. Billboard 200. It peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 with the singles \"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\", while \"The One That Got Away\" reached number three on the chart. The album became the first by a female artist to produce five number-one songs in the U.S., and the second overall after Michael Jackson's Bad. In 2012, Perry re-issued the album as Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, which produced the songs \"Part of Me\" and \"Wide Awake\". Her next record was Prism (2013), which became her second to top the U.S. charts. It is influenced by pop and dance, and she became the first artist with multiple videos to reach one billion views on Vevo with the videos for its songs \"Roar\" and \"Dark Horse\". She followed this with 2017's Witness, which delved into electropop and became her third album to chart at number one in the U.S. \"Chained to the Rhythm\" was the album's most successful single, breaking Spotify's record at the time for most first-day streams for a song by a female artist.\nPerry has received various awards, including four Guinness World Records, five Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, a Juno Award, and thirteen Grammy Award nominations. She has been included in the annual Forbes lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011\u20132019. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. She is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 18 million albums and 125 million singles worldwide. In the film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled Katy Perry: Part of Me in 2012 and voiced Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and its sequel in 2013. Perry also began serving as a judge on American Idol in 2018.\n(source: Wikipedia)\nThanks for Reading\nUpvote if you agree with my answer.

Let\u2019s assume you have the computer, Audio Interface and DAW already. There are several ways, all will yield great results if you take the time to set it all up and test your sound before committing to recording the whole sections. One thing to keep in mind, microphone placement is critical and even an inch to the left/right/up/down can change the tone dramatically. I will give you just three different ways that I have used myself to record acoustic guitar. I should note that I use external mic Preamps with my audio interface in line mode (bypassing the internal preamps). But interface built-in pre\u2019s are quite capable of getting great results too.\nThe Blumlein mic setup works well. This requires recording in stereo (or to two tracks). A pair of matched mics works best here. The are usually condenser mics with a figure 8 pattern place 90\u00b0 from each other in close proximity of the array (where the mics are facing) placement should be played with here. Try them pointed at the sound hole, towards the neck etc. Do a couple of short test recordings and listen back to them to see what sounds like the tone you want to achieve. I would also suggest a 3rd mic here recording on a separate track. I like to use a large capsule condenser as a room mic when I record acoustic guitars and I place it as far away as possible from the guitar (more on this later). It\u2019s not a must, but it can be used to blend in and help give a wider stereo fullness to the piece. This method might not be the cheapest. I started with a pair of Behringer C-2 mics for the Blumlein setup. Cost was under $75us and a Behringer C-1 condenser that I got used for $40us\nTwo mics, a dynamic and a condenser. I use a Shure SM-57 for the dynamic, it\u2019s like the Swiss Army knife of microphones. It tends to record a bit darker than others, but not in a bad way..at least to my ears. I use them as cab mics for electric guitars on almost every project. The dynamic is pointed off-axis towards the top of the fretboard (around the 5th fret pointed downward) and the condenser it aimed at the sound hole. They are recorded to separate tracks. If you want, you can throw in a room mic here too. Can\u2019t hurt. If you have the mics available why not, you could always just delete the track if it sounds like crap anyway, right ? The Shure SM-57 is a MUST HAVE mic IMO. They are built like a tank and can take a real beating. They last damn near forever and are around $100us brand new. Budget wise you can use the C-1 here for the condenser until you can afford a better mic. A step up could be a Golden Age Project FC-1 mkII (around $110us) Another condenser choice albeit more expensive, could be an Aston Origin. This is more of a mid-level mic, but an excellent instrument mic IMO. Cost is around $300us but it works great for just about everything from cabs to vocals to overheads on drums.\nThis one is just in case you have an electric-acoustic. As a rule of thumb I NEVER use the built-in pickup as the ONLY source in acoustic tracks. But as an additional track, hell yeah. I plug in the acoustic through one of my 500 series rack Preamps DI\u2019s and then mic it up the same as either of the other methods above. The DI track tends to record \u201chot\u201d so be careful with your gain staging here. Sometimes I like to drive the input level though..add a little bit of \u201ccolor\u201d or saturation to the mix. It\u2019s recorded to a separate track so it can easily be blended in or cut out if it doesn\u2019t \u201cfit\u201d well. For me, it\u2019s all about options for the final mix\nHaving 3 tracks of the same take gives me clean, in time and synced takes. Here is where you can get creative. With all of them played back center panned it will sound like a single track for the most part. What I do is add a little delay to the room mic (if the placement didn\u2019t result in any on it\u2019s own, but I usually place the room mic as far away from the source as possible and set the gain accordingly to match the close mics). That is left center panned, the other two tracks I pan slightly left/right. Now we have separation and a much wider stereo feel. Method 1 What I generally like to do is hard pan the stereo mics if I recorded them to two different tracks. There are many more ways, this is just 3 I use a lot. As I stated at the very beginning, mic placement plays a HUGE role, so be sure to experiment with it, take your time, don\u2019t just plug in the mics, point and record. As I said, an inch can make a huge difference in the tone. Once you get them to your likely, take a picture or make notes of some measurements so you can easily duplicate (or get in the ballpark faster) the same tone the next time you record the acoustic.", "It really depends on what quality of final product for which you are looking.

It would start with Eric Clapton leaving John Mayall\u2019s Bluesbreakers to form Cream and Peter Green brought on to replace him. There he meets Mick Fleetwood and John McVie and they decide to form Peter Green\u2019s Fleetwood Mac. Soon after forming they hear an incredible slide guitarist named Jeremy Spencer and get him to join changing their name to Peter Green\u2019s Fleetwood Mac featuring Jeremy Spencer. While playing a few live shows to tighten their sound their manager suggests they go see a band featuring another great guitarist. The band is pretty bad but the guitarist is the real deal and they ask Danny Kirwan to join them. At this point they realize that not everyone can get their name in the band\u2019s name and shorten it to Fleetwood Mac.\nFrom there comes incredible success with commercially and critically successful albums and world tours. That\u2019s when the trouble begins. Following the recording of Then Play On they decide to take a short break before doing another tour of the US. During the break, Peter Green meets some hippies in Germany and spends a couple of months in a German castle doing massive amounts of LSD. He never really recovered from it and left the band. Since the band were under contract to tour the US they decided to carry on. Somewhere in Texas Jeremy Spencer disappeared. It turns out he met a couple of young women from the cult Children of God and they convinced him to join the cult. That left Danny Kirwan who found himself going from one of three guitarists to the only guitarist. The pressure was too much for him and he became an alcoholic. It got so bad the band finally had to fire him.\nSo there you have the makings of a great musical biopic from their beginnings through their triumphs and ending as they crash and burn.

The frequency stays the same while the speaker gets louder because it is literally making the same wave shape, just at smaller and larger scales of power.\nFrequency is when that shape changes.

The four strings of a violin G,D,A,E correspond to their counter parts on the piano. But a piano is slightly mistuned to permit easy movement from one key to another. This is called temperment. There are several temperment schemes and you\u2019ve probably heard of Bach\u2019s \u201cWell-Tempered Clavier.\u201d This was an early temperment scheme. There is an international standard one now according to my piano tuner who was at my house yesterday. The best example I can give is on a violin, when you play a B on the A string, an interval of a sixth and tune it to Pythagorean consonance that same B when played with and open E will sound out of tune to a trained ear. So violinists make a slight adjustment. Since a violin is continuously variable, except for the four open strings we can tweak the pitch, something pianists cannot do. Kurt Sussmanhaus, noted violin teacher explains this better than I can in this video", "It's called timbre, a French word pronounced \u201ctam-ber.\u201d It means tone color. The two instruments may play the same pitch but the difference is in the timbre, which is produced by different overtones. There is also the kind of attack which starts the sound. The piano is a percussion instrument in which the sound is produced by the striking of a \u201chammer\u201d (a rounded walnut core covered with a thick layer of felt) on a steel string under tremendous tension. The violin sound is produced by rubbing a horsehair bow (roughened with rosin, a solidified tree sap) against a string (which used to be made of catgut; today other materials are used). It would be illogical for the two instruments to sound alike!", "Both the violin and the piano are \u2018C\u2018 instruments which means they both read the same notes on the treble clef. So if they read an F (bottom space on the treble clef staff) for example, the pitch will be exactly the same on both instruments. So they\u2019re not different in that way. Unless you mean the tone of the piano and violin which, of course, are quite different.\nBoth are stringed instruments but are executed differently. Violin strings are bowed which creates its own unique tone and timbre (among other things) compared to the piano whose strings are struck by a hammer to produce its own unique tone and timbre. In that case, they are different.", "There are a lot of contributing factors. The shape of the piano is different than the shape of the violin, the composites of the strings are different, and the medium of making the sound is different as well. The piano hits the string with a mallet to make it vibrate whereas the violin uses constant friction to cause vibration with a bow.", "Since violins have a different type of string and playing method than pianos do, notes sound different.

Spanish music sounds faster with more percusion, the clapping, and more agressive rythms. And it's more guitar, guitar is the essence of any bit of music from Spain. Mexican music feels like the same thing, but kinder, the rythms are slower.\nAlso lots of guitar and similar instruments to Spain but more varied, usually there are more instruments so it feels more colourful, Spaniards tend to like more the effect of just one guy with one guitar and some percusion. There are groups in Spain too and obviously music with more \u201cbody\", but in a general sense, I feel music from Spain is less of an orchestra type of music than Mexican music.\nSpanish music\nMexican music\nGetting metaphoric, Spanish music to me is like a bonfire and fireworks on the beach the night of San Juan to celebrate the start of the summer, like a car going through the yellow fields of inland Spain during an August afternoon with 40 degrees and a burning Sun. Lonely, faster, more aggressive, burning.\nMexican music is like a tropical forest with trees in all colours and shapes cut by a slow wide river, like a large dinner in the backyard of a colonial hacienda with all the tastes of Mexican food. Social, more joyful, slower, colourful.\nSome examples of what I mean\u2026\nThis song La Bikina in the movie Coco and the song Llorar\u00e9 las Penas by David Bisbal, in this case the Spanish song doesn't feel less colourful to me, in fact it sounds quite similar to the Mexican in terms of instruments; but the Spanish one is a lot more aggressive.\nLa Bikina (Mexico)\nLlorar\u00e9 las Penas (Spain)\nBut outside some cases like that, I think Spanish music tends to have less body than Mexican music, which makes it more \u201clonely\" as I said before. For instance here you have a song by Spanish group called Amaral, this song is called Cuando Suba La Marea and it's the song you hear in Money Heist or La Casa de Papel when they take the body of Nairobi outside\nNairobi's Funeral in La Casa de Papel\nCuando Suba La Marea (Spain)\nThis song captures the essence for me of that typical song on the radio when you come back to Madrid at the end of the summer in the car through the fields of Castile with a burning sun. Because it's the typical Spanish \u201cpop\" with a slight sad tone for the end of the summer feeling.\nAnother example which keeps the \u201caggressiveness\" of the first song while fitting a lot more with this typical Spanish sound is Estopa. For example here you have the song Fuego by them.\nFuego (Spain)\nKeeping the story of the car, this music is the one you would hear in the petrol station when you stop to repost and buy a sandwhich of tortilla for the rest of the ride. And this is not a metaphore, this is a description of what actually sounds in every Spanish petrol station.\nOn the contrary Mexican music if you get to more typically Mexican sounds still feels more colourful, and certainly a LOT slower.\nAdi\u00f3s Amor by Cristian Nodal (Mexico)\nOr this one which is a corrido originally a type of poem from Spain and then a very typical type of music from New Spain and after independence Mexico. And honouring that this song by Mexicans is set in Spain.\nLa Reina del Sur by Los Tigres del Norte (Mexico)\nThen again, none of this applies to modern pop-electronic music or party music, which is identical in all the Spanish speaking world, it's the so called modern Latin music. And this is the music you will listen in parties in Spain and Latin America, and the main music produced by Spaniards and Latin Americans today. And there is no difference at all between countries, all Spanish speaking countries produce this the same and with singers from one country featuring those from the other constantly, any of these songs without more than one Hispanic country involved is impossible to find.\nAnd actually increasingly Italians too, Italy is slowly \u2013if not quickly\u2013 becoming part of the market, I could name Italians who are \u201cbig\" stars of Latin music listened in Spain and Latin America today.\nHere you have an example of electronic-Latin pop song by a Mexican group called CNCO and a Spaniard called Ana Mena\nAhora Lloras T\u00fa, by CNCO and Ana Mena (Mexico and Spain)\nAnd here you have a more reguet\u00f3n-like typical Latin party song that you would hear in any nightclub in Spain or Latin America, also by CNCO (I only know them and Sof\u00eda Reyes making this type of music from Mexico) and the Spaniard Abraham Mateo, who used to make more Anglophone type of pop music but at some point he started to make Latin party music and he's become pretty big in that genre.\nMe Vuelvo Loco, by CNCO amd Abraham Mateo (Mexico and Spain)\nYou also have examples of this in the US, Becky G or Bad Bunny are the main US stars in this type of music, obviously both Latinos, one descended from Mexicans and the other Puerto Rican.", "Not necessarily.

If you like live theatre, and music and singing, you should like operas because you already like each of the three things which, put together, make up operas.\nThe great thing about opera is that opera is, absolutely and hands down, the most directly emotional theater ever. The music and the singing act on your emotions without you even being conscious of them doing so. You will smile when the composer and writer want you to smile, laugh when the composer and writer want you to laugh, and cry when the composer and writer want you cry.\nTo figure out what operas to get into, think about what types of movies you like. And think about how you go see movies - do you go to them on dates with a sweetheart ? Or do you go with a friend or bunch of friends ?\nDo you like romantic movies ? Really, really, romantic movies ? With maybe sad endings, so you get elated and then get some sadness, and even some tears ?\nIf so, got the number one recommendation for you: La Boheme, by Giacomo Puccini.\nThere are three things necessary to love La Boheme.\nFirst, you have to have been young at some time in your life. Most people have done this, or they are young.\nSecond, you have to have been in love at some time when you were young. Really deeply in love. Again, this is a fairly common experience.\nThird, at least one of those times you were young and in love, it has to have ended not very well. This is pretty common, too.\nSo. Go see La Boheme, live on stage, and go with a sweetie or a friend or two. Make a trip if you have to, to see a performance, if there is one near you. If there isn\u2019t, well, go see something else.\nOpera does require a bit of preparation to enjoy. Basically, you will want to know the story before you go, so. . . buy a DVD and watch and listen. My favorite DVD of La Boheme is the one from the Australian Opera, directed by Baz Luhrman. Familiar name ? From movies - Moulin Rouge, for one. Turn on the subtitles ! Read them as it goes along - you will see.\nIf you buy a CD recording, it will probably have a booklet with it that has the text in the original language and an English translation parallel to the original language. Listen, and follow along, with the original language and the English translation - you will see how it goes. And you will start to learn the Italian (or French, or German, though Russian is difficult) (If you are listening to an English opera, you will really appreciate the surtitles or subtitles or text booklet. American singers are much clearer, to Americans, anyhow).\nMost opera theaters now have supertitles, with the translations shown above the stage, in parallel with the action on stage. The program will have a synopsis of the plot and action, so read it, and watch.\nKeep in mind that opera productions, the stuff you see on stage, the set, the props, the costumes, can be and generally are different from each other - there is no One Right Way to do the stage picture of any opera. The action of La Boheme was originally set in about 1845; the Australian production is set in about 1955. It works fine - young love is always the same.\nSo where to go ? You know - anyplace there is a theater. A big city is probably best, because big cities are more likely to have theaters. But, and this is important, so do universities - if you have a local or close by university with a music department, look at their schedule. And go. Go and see it live if at all possible.\nWhat to wear ? Folks get all anxious about this, with no need. Just dress up a bit, like you would for a date to a nice place. That is it; nothing to it.\nThe important thing is - go see it live."], "date_list": ["Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Elizabeth James", "view_list": [235, 214, 159, 23, 6, 184]}, "485": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Ryan Jacob Dunfee"], "question_title": "What is the music app on iPhone?", "topic_list": ["iPhone Applications", "iPhones (product)", "Mobile Applications", "Music"], "no_of_view": "183", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["Apple Music"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Catherine Doucer", "view_list": [5]}, "836": {"no_of_follower": 0, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Robert Stevens"], "question_title": "I was gonna take music as a GCSE but my school didn't let me because there was not enough people.

Thanks, Deevin, Your the best or one of the best at writing answers on Kpop and as a person in general.\nEvelyn G. Medrano (\uc5d0\ube14\ub9b0 \uba54\ub4dc \ub77c\ub178) - I also like Evelyn as a friend and a person in general. Her answers are good and informative. I also like it when her answers are short and simple and they cut right to the point insted of beating around the bush and then coming to the point. Some people *cough cough me* beat around the bush and see I even did it again Lol Anyway Short and simple is the key to success and Evelyn shows that above and beyond.\nAspry Wright - I sometimes read his answers and they are good I have to admit. His Answers are mostly about Girl\u2019s groups and I can't name a Kpop girls group off the top of my head. So yeah I like his answers.\nYeon Park - I don't know how I followed him but I like his humor in the Kpop answers. His answers are good too!!\nHonorable Mentions\nGrace Yang\nKim Seokjin\nGabriela Forte\nJoy Yang\nYui Lee\nThat\u2019s it Guys But again if You are not on the list. It doesn't mean I don't like you. I still like you but It just means I have to be more active on Quora and have to find some way to discover you.\nI will add more if I find any other good Kpop writers\nEDIT 1. I have found Two more good Kpop Quorans...\nDaniel Baker - Okay So I discovered his profile and took like two days to read his answers. His Answers are honest and informative. I like the way when he speaks for the other groups in an honest way. Good Job Daniel!!!!\nReena Carson - I also like her answers when I read it. So same thing with Daniel. Honest and Informative Keep up the good work Reena!!! Doing good so far!! :)\nAgain I will add more if I find anyone else\nEDIT 2. Although This sounds childish and pretty much 99% of all Quorans will be laughing about this. Thanks for the 5 upvotes!! I think this is the most upvoted answer I wrote so far.\nEDIT 3 - I changed my picture because I feel like I don't look good on the last one. I am still confused in my new pic Lol.\nEDIT 4 - 10 Upvotes?? Wow, I am speechless guys. You guys are the best. This is the most upvoted answer in my whole Profile.

I have a few favourites though (if I haven\u2019t mentioned anyone then don\u2019t worry! I still like and appreciate you!):\nInuri Hettiarachchi: Inuri\u2019s answers are always so considerate, informed and respectful. But they\u2019re also honest. It\u2019s really easy to appreciate that content. Her answers are always a joy to read, and (when necessary) can be quite hilarious too :)\nGrace Yang: Grace is one of the most mature and insightful ARMYS I\u2019ve met here on Quora. Her answers are always honest, informed and I love reading them. She has great flow as well. She\u2019s always open to discussion, and debate as well. But she\u2019s also cool just to talk to.\nAdam Smith: Adam is very insightful, and very honest, but in a respectful way. He\u2019s never afraid to offer his brutally honest opinions on controversial issues in K-pop, but always manages to keep them respectful. He remains unbiased and provides a unique perspective on K-Pop. He is also always open to debate and discussion on his opinions, and is quite interesting to talk to. He is also quite well-spoken, philosophical and creative when he needs to be, and makes me question my own views. Couldn\u2019t appreciate him or his answers more :)\nJo Sosna: Her answers are very honest, and make me question my thoughts. I love it when writers are able to do this :)\nKrenda Seiler: She\u2019s such as creative thinker and writer. She explains her opinions well, which makes for an interesting read.

I always find her answers to be bold & straightforward which is why she's one of my favourites.\nAspry Wright - His answers sound so professional and it seems like he's well informed on girl groups more than anyone.Hehe. For real though, I love going through his answers. A must follow,if you are into girl groups.\nJo Sosna - I come across her answers a lot on my feed,and I thoroughly enjoy reading them.

Every time I would need an answer to a Red Velvet question, Ru would already have that answered in a different question. Her answers are just filled with so much facts and color, it\u2019s literally eye candy to me. Her dedication to Red Velvet helps me create that same dedication to stanning other groups and what not. Ru spends a lot of time writing answers, and although people only realize the controversial things she has written, little do they know the time it takes to come up with such an answer. Ru, I appreciate the efforts you take to give us quality answers, thank you. <3", "There are several which I can't mention one by one, but my number one favourite K-Pop Quoran is my man Aspry Wright.\nAspry is twice my age, which sounds weird considering many K-Pop Quorans are teenagers and young adults, I'm even considered pretty old in this space. I just find his content interesting and I love his sense of humour.\nAspry likes a lot of groups, but if I can remember correctly, he's one of the few Miracle Quorans here. Well.. you can find ARMYs and Onces quite easily, but Miracles? Not so much. Considering my affinity towards non Big 3 groups, with Twice being the only Big 3 group I like, I'm very happy to find someone who likes a group which isn't BTS or any from the Big 3.\nAspry is also one of the Quorans who doesn't hate Blackpink. I constantly wrote answers degrading Blackpink at least until a few months ago, but I'm struggling to get rid of my image as a Blackpink hater. From my point of view, Aspry is pretty unbiased. He answers a lot of comparison questions and I've read his answers more than enough times to approve my earlier statement.\nAspry's bias in Twice is Sana, who's my bias wrecker of the same group. He isn't an Ujung, but I'm pretty sure Cheng Xiao (who shares her birthday with me) is his ultimate bias.\n-\nHonourable mentions goes to Yeon Park, Favor Mulalira, Lauren RB, and Arina Glebova.\nOut of all of them, I particularly enjoy interacting with Amina. She's a fellow Buddy just like me and I like how outspoken she is.\nEshaan is a girl group stan and mainly a Leggo. Even in EXID he likes Hyerin who is one of the less popular members, well.. I also have a tendency to like the underrated (or underappreciated) members, so Eshaan is very relatable to me.\nFavor, well.. is Favor. Her ultimate bias is Hwasa and for some reasons I always expected her to look like Hwasa, because Favor is African and Hwasa doesn't look like a typical K-pop idol with her tanned skin and curvy body.\nLauren often pops up in my feed and her name is pretty familiar and the easiest one to remember for me. There are few more but I can't remember them one by one.", "Five letter name", "uhhhH i don\u2019t have a favorite quoran cause like a lot of them are great people, but i do have a list of people i wanna mention \ud83d\ude08\n\u2026..\nYui Lee : her answers are really entertaining and i enjoy them a lot. i do think she\u2019s a very kind person and cares about her followers a lot uWu. her answers are sO well written, i mean i would most likely mistake her for a high-schooler cause like\u2014she doesn\u2019t act like a typical middle school so i\u2019m like triple shook. she is also one of my friendos i made on quora, like ngl, i was awkward as shit when we first chatted but she was very nice to me which made me like her even more as a quoran writer. <3\n__\nSage M.

His answers are also filled with so much\u2026 smartness, you can tell he\u2019s a genius. AND, he\u2019s the biggest girl group enthusiast I have ever come in contact with. (Because of that, I have a mild obsession with Mamamoo\u2026) Eshaan is a wonderful dude and everyone needs a friend like him!\n~fm", "Who is your favourite K-Pop Quoran? Why?\nThis is a somewhat easy answer and it's kinda not. Because I enjoy lots of reads in this community as I come to understand the music more and more. I write a lot on here because it is new to me and when I like something new, I abuse it to death. But instead of writing, when coming across a good read it's an extra treat.\nJordan Lubus adds a great deal of insight in perhaps one or two posts a week. His writing is strong and he supports his points, which is where the insight comes in. Opinions are nice but adding reasons and examples for and about how you feel are the very guts of editorializing. Everything Jordan writes, I think to myself \u201cthat's how I'd have done it.\u201d\nNone of this is payback, btw. Just because I was featured in Jordan's question doesn't mean that's why I'm writing this. Just recently we shared messages where I praised his writing style and ability, so this was an overdue post. I'd tell you to follow Jordan but you probably already are if you're smart.\nNow you owe ME Twice tickets.\nThank's for reading.", "I have a great time reading Favor Mulalira, Sven Alexanderson, Selma Finn, Aspry Wright, and Maleah\u2019s answers. All of them are great K-pop Quorans who have detailed answers.\nFavor is a great friend of mine, we die after watching Hyerin and Mamamoo videos. I even turned on the \u201cNotify Me\u201d thingy so I get the notif everytime Favor writes an answer. She writes amazing answers mainly about Ateez, BTS, and Oneus, Favor even got about 300 upvotes on an answer. She is an awesome Quoran, go follow her.\nSven is a fellow Buddy and Once that knows a lot of knowledge about Kpop. His English is better than mine, sadly, and I enjoy reading his answers. I don\u2019t know his Gfriend bias, and I predict he will say it in the comments. I like how he gives his former Blink experience and telling us why he left.

She\u2019s basically listened to every song I have, she\u2019s amazing, go follow.\nAspry knows a lot about Twice and Oh My Girl (a rare Miracle Quoran), and it\u2019s fun to read his answers. I also love how he first writes the question in bold before the answer, it at least awakens the crowd. His answers are quite similar to mine, but he somehow manages to write longer than me and I still don\u2019t understand how. He\u2019s amazing, follow him now.\nMaleah recently followed me and she is so relatable with a year in age difference omg. I love her answers, go read them and follow her.\nWhoever you are, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t say your name. It\u2019s either because I\u2019m really tired to write anymore today or I haven\u2019t known you that well YET. Anyways, there you have it (btw to everyone that\u2019s gonna thank me for mentioning them, you\u2019re welcome. it\u2019ll spare my brain from writing 5 comments with the same words in them).", "Oof, this is a tough one to answer, because pretty much everyone I\u2019ve encountered in the K-Pop Quora community is super cool.\nBefore I got back into K-Pop, I mostly wrote about video games and anime. And let me tell you, you\u2019d be surprised at just how heated Naruto conversations can get.\nBut in the K-Pop community, pretty much everyone here is kind and respectful. They get super hyped about shared fandoms and opinions, but are amicable in the case of disagreement. It\u2019s a nice vibe overall.\nHmm, if I had to choose though, I\u2019mma go with Aspry Wright as my favorite K-Pop Quoran.\nOne of the main reasons is his writing. Composition-wise, it\u2019s always on point without grievous typos. This is just me being anal because English has always been my best subject (I will literally find a typo in my own answer from 5 months ago and facepalm before hastily correcting it), but sometimes I see an answer on Quora that makes me go \u201cOof.\u201d\nBut way more important than that, it\u2019s his style. He somehow hits a magic point in the center of the writing grid where his answers are both succinct but elaborate, casual but eloquent. You\u2019ll get a quality answer from him, and he\u2019ll insert little bits of humor into it. It will always sound like you\u2019re just having a conversation.\nThe second main reason his about how knowledgeable he is. The amount of K-Pop idols this man can keep track of is astounding. I follow like 5 groups and I\u2019m already overwhelmed. He has answers on so many different idols that pretty much any fandom can find their way to his answers. I respect the multi-stanning.\nAnd I don\u2019t know if this should count as points to him as a K-Pop Quoran, but his knowledge doesn\u2019t stop there. Game of Thrones, comics, classic television, you name it, Aspry knows it. Guy is a complete whiz, and I enjoy having my horizons broadened by his posts.\nAs a final point, he put me on to Red Velvet.\nGood looks fam.", "Hmmmmmm lemme think\u2026..\nHave you ever heard of this girl named Ella Taylor? I love her answers and she\u2019s kinda the reason why I stay on Quora. Even though I don\u2019t approve of ALL her answers, I still love her and she is like my Quora rolemodel! She\u2019s my favorite Quora person ever! (PS: I love uuuu)", "Kim Seokjin writes amazing answers.

If combined with maturity and critical thinking, tribalism can lead to strong communities with good value systems that allow the tribe to grow and prosper. If tribalism is based on a desire to please others (peer pressure), to acquire status (social networking), or to impress (projecting fake identity), then of course we have negative, immature outcomes. Most music genres arise in the context of historical and social events and if a musical style arises out of a social oppression or a need to liberate oneself from certain norms, people identify with that music in the same way as they identify with the tribe. What can happen is that the music loses its meaning or the musicians are shown to be hypocrites or undeserving of imitation. Regardless, the genre can become irrelevant due to lack of authenticity. People who cling to the genre despite this because they lack critical thinking and maturity perpetuate an immature community. They then have their identity at stake and have to construct an ideology which they rationalize and defend regardless of evidence, and since we also live in an pluralist age in which opinion and taste have been proclaimed as far more important than fact and skill, the path to immature communities based on subjectivity continues. I\u2019d say that if people had a set of basic standards by wich to evaluate music, such as authenticity (how does the musician live in relation to the message of the music?), emotional communication, depth of meaning, and skill, we would see fewer shallow genres being defended for superficial reasons.", "Many people seem to think their taste in music, in books, in films defines them.

By this time, you probably need to start going back in time approximately five minutes and start tuning each of the strings to their proper pitch. This is also a good time to start collecting trash, string clippings, minor cleaning, or other productive things. Remember, this process should slow down once you get near the end. You don't want to exceed the intended tension for the strings. With that in mind, continue:\nThird string: a major third higher to B. Wait five minutes. Find something else productive to do.

But because it stretches, they keep detunig until the material gets to the point where it stabilizes and can't stretch any more.\nNow, two weeks, assuming you regularly play and hence tune up quite often, should be more than enough to let the strings stabilize. If this is indeed the case, then it is likely that you did not tie or wind your strings correctly, making them slip.\nHowever, if you barely touched your guitar since, all it needs is a stretch.

Not better at playing uke!!!\nPlaying songs is an important part of every practice session. You need to have fun with the uke. That\u2019s why you\u2019re learning it.\nBut if you want to get better at playing uke, you need to practice . . . uke, not songs.\nIf you\u2019re a beginner, you probably learned 4 chords.

And your body needs to develop a LOT of muscle memory. And in more places than just your fingers. Playing a song is indeed practicing the chords of that song. But only in a single song context. And you\u2019re only playing the chords in one order. Not \u201cevery\u201d order. So no muscle memory is being developed for all possible chord changes.\nSo what you do is practice each chord you know, with ALL of the other chords you know. It\u2019s called permutation.

The hand and finger movements going from G to C are NOT the same as going from C to G!\nTo develop serious muscle memory, (which is what happened to those people who got really good!) you need to work on ALL of the permutations. Like this . . .\nLet\u2019s do 4/4 time first. Then we\u2019ll look at 3/4 time. In the exercises below, strum each chord for 4 counts. You can strum 1 strum per count, like 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 etc. Or if you know some strum patterns already, use those. Like 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & . . . or 1 &a 2 &a 3&a 4&a. What ever. And a \u201c \u2018 \u201c is one count. So C \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 would be C 2 3 4 .\nC \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 Am \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 C \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 Am \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 % (% - REPEAT.

Let\u2019s say you learn a Bm. That would be a logical next chord. The 1st four chords are used in literally 100\u2019s and 100\u2019s of songs. Learning a Bm will add another couple 100 songs!!!!\nSo add Bm into the mix . . . Each time you practice you do all of the above first! Then add in the new combinations . . .\nC \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 Bm \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 C \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 Bm \u2018 \u2018 \u2018\nAm \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 Bm \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 Am \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 Bm \u2018 \u2018 \u2018\nF \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 Bm \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 F \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 Bm \u2018 \u2018 \u2018\nG \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 Bm \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 G \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 Bm \u2018 \u2018 \u2018\nOK, the last 3rd, before you start playing songs today for fun. You gotta finish your practice before you play songs.!\nPROGRESSIONS: Progressions are also combinations of chords, but played together in a series. Most often the series will be 8 bars, or 12, or 16. (A lot of Jazz standards are in 32 measures, or bars.)\nSongs are just progressions, for the most part. Every song has an order the chords go in. So let\u2019s practice the most common progressions in C. You will be essentially learning, and practicing 300 to 400 (probably closer to 1,000 if you consider many genre.) different songs when you practice the progressions!\nHere are the most common progressions. They are used in Gospel, Rock, Folk, Jazz, Country, Gypsy, Blues, get the picture!!! We\u2019ll start with 4/4. You do them all, then go back and do them again in 3/4. After the 1st one, I\u2018ll leave off the \u201c \u2018 \u201c marks. But play them all the same.\n8 BAR: C \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 F \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 C \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 G \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 C \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 F \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 C \u2018 G \u2018 C \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 %%%%%\n12 BAR 1: C C C C F F C C G F C G %%%%%\n12 BAR 2: C F C C F F C C G \u2018 F \u2018 C \u2018 G \u2018 %%%%%\nThe 50\u2019s Progressions . . . There are 2, but you need to learn Bm for the second one.\nC \u2018 Am \u2018 F \u2018 G \u2018 C \u2018 Am \u2018 F \u2018 G \u2018 %%%%%\nC \u2018 Am \u2018 Bm \u2018 G \u2018 C \u2018 Am \u2018 Bm \u2018 G \u2018 %%%%%\n~\nNEXT STEP: Learn an Em, Dm and (with a teeny bit of a stretch) you have all the chords in the key of C, and can play any song in C, except for some now and then that have unique melodies and use chords out side of the key they\u2019re in.\n~\nAfter that, (working with a teacher if necessary) take everything I showed you above, and pick a new key. If you chose the key of G next, you already know all but 2 of the chords! Just learn a D and you have most of the songs covered. And you can play ALL of the progression exercises above in G. Learning an F#diminished (or minor in a pinch) will cover the rest.\nEither learn how to transpose, (for another topic!) or work with a teacher. Show him your exercises and progressions and have him show you how to change them all to the key of G.\nSo now you can play basically ANY song you can think of, in both the key of C and G.\n1). DO NOT forget to add each chord to ALL of your permutations! That list of exercises gets bigger every time you add a new chord. But by the time you even added just the Bm above, you\u2019ll know the 1st group so well, you\u2019ll just play each one 3 or 4 times, and move to the next. BUT DO THEM ALL!. Every day. Start to finish.\n3). As you continue to learn 1 or 2 chords at a time, if you add the right ones, you add another key to your skill set!!!!\nWhen you have this done for the keys of C, D, E, F, G, A and Bb . . . you will be able to play just about any song ever written, in almost any key.\nNOTE: There is a LOT more to playing a song than just strumming chords. There\u2019s timing, playing single notes (lead, solo and fills) there\u2019s learning how to be percussive! How to entertain. How to make a melody out of chords!!!!\nThat will all come with time as well. How much time? Somewhere between a few years . . . and a life time!", "It is a great way to learn. It sets you up with a specific goal. You will learn the chords, the strum patterns and the words to go with that song.

When we feel positive emotions they are often mixed in with negative emotions as well. So because our negative emotions are easier to identify they're also easier to write about. I also think that are negative emotions tend to be stronger than that of our positive emotions. For a personal example, I have dealt with a lot of trauma in my life. Because of my experiences with negative emotions I am more familiar with them then with positive emotions. I am in a very happy relationship with my boyfriend and we love each other, but because I do not have as much experience but this love it is harder for me to write about it. We live in a broken world, and so other artists are going to have more experience with negative emotions and positive emotions, so that means that there are going to be more negative songs than positive songs. That's my two cents on this question, though I bet people with more experience with positive emotions will give you a more positive answer.

His first album, Infinite (1996), sold poorly, however, and he continued to work menial jobs.\nIn 2020, Eminem\u2019s net worth is estimated at $230 million. This makes him one of the richest rappers in the world, next to the likes of Dr. Dre, Sean Combs, Jay Z and more.", "Eminem, AKA Marshall Mathers, AKA Slim Shady, is an American rapper, originally from Missouri. He is without a doubt, the most notorious and influential white rapper in hip-hop, challenging the stereotypes of rap music.\nEminem is now 44 years old, one of the best-selling hip-hop artists of all time.\nIn 2020, Eminem\u2019s net worth is estimated at $230 million. This makes him one of the richest rappers in the world, next to the likes of Dr. Dre\n, Sean Combs\n, Jay Z\nand more.\nEarly Life\nMarshall Mathers was born in St. Joseph, Missouri on the 17th October 1972. His father Bruce left them and moved to California to start a new family. Eminem had a rough childhood and was often bullied and beat up in school.\nWhen his family was living in Detroit, their home was in a majorly black neighborhood, and thus Eminem was also victim to racial beatings during that time.\nBefore he discovered hip-hop, he was first very passionate about comic books and storytelling. He dropped out of Lincoln High school at 17 years old, and worked at various jobs to help pay the bills.\nHis mother would often throw him out of the house, and neglect him. Whenever she went to play Bingo, Eminem would turn up his stereo and start writing songs.\nCareer\nEminem started performing at rap battles with his friend Mike Ruby when he was only 14. Later on, as his reputation grew, he was recruited by several rap groups, including New Jacks, Soul Intent, and D12.\nHis first solo album, \u2018Infinite\n\u2019, was released in 1996, and was a failure; majorly due to Eminem\u2019s style, and feelings people had towards it at that time. He was told that his style was not cut out for hip hop, and that only motivated him to keep on writing more rhymes.\nIn 1997, he was spotted by Dr. Dre, the founder of Aftermath entertainment, and began working with him. Two years later, The Slim Shady LP was released and went Platinum.\nSince then, Eminem has released multiple albums and sold over 40 million copies in the US alone. He\u2019s collaborated with a wide number of artists and even starred in a movie based on his story.\nToday, Eminem is considered to be one of the best, if not the best, rappers of all time.

Don\u2019t be afraid to be different\nWhen Eminem first started performing at battle raps, he was one of the only white performers. He was victim to a lot of stereotypical harassment, centered about the thought that white people can\u2019t rap. He proved a lot of people wrong, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\n2. Your past does not have to determine your future\nMarshall suffered from a lot of bullying when he was younger, always moving from place to place, and never really staying in one spot long enough to make friends.\nHe could have let these experiences dictate how his life was going to turn out; but instead, he used them as motivation.\n3. Stand up for yourself\nI don\u2019t think that Eminem would be where he is today if he didn\u2019t stand up for himself and for his dreams. Knowing what he wanted, and believing in exactly that, fuelled him for success. Despite people trying to tell them what he could and couldn\u2019t accomplish.\n4. Collaborate with others\nWe mentioned above, just how many people Eminem has collaborated with in his career. And it\u2019s a lot. In fact, when you look at some of his most recent albums, he\u2019s actually made it his mission to collaborate with other artists on each of his songs.\nHe\u2019s done an excellent job of collaborating with other people, and that has allowed him to gain opportunities which produce different styles of music, and help promote his albums to the respective audiences.\n5. Always be adapting\nIf you take a look at the work Eminem produced early on in his career, and compare it with his most recent work; you\u2019ll see that the type of music he produces, and the topics he raps about have changed.\nWhich is interesting, intriguing, and makes for the perfect story of progression both in music and his personal life. The lesson here is don\u2019t be afraid to adapt. You don\u2019t have to continue doing the exact same thing that made you successful in the first place.\n5 Surprising Facts About Eminem\n1. Eminem was still making payments on his trailer home when the Slim Shady LP dropped.\n2. Eminem doesn\u2019t allow people to curse in his home, and he won\u2019t swear in front of children.\n3. Eminem said he used to spend hours every night studying the dictionary, so he could expand his vocabulary for his rhymes.\n4. Before he became a rapper, Eminem\u2019s true dream was to become a comic book artist.\n5. Eminem got evicted the night before the 1997 Rap Olympics, and had to break into his own place and sleep on the floor before leaving for LA.\nSummary\nWell, Marshall Mathers is one of the most successful hip-hop artists in history and one of the 20 richest rappers\nworldwide.\nIn 2020, Eminem\u2019s net worth is estimated to be $230 million.\nHe\u2019s inspired many other artists to climb through the ranks, and he\u2019s also helped people all over the world in dealing with the problems they face in life."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Aman Kumar", "view_list": [2, 216, 41]}, "693": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Dani Alcide"], "question_title": "Which K-pop company allows you to produce and choreograph ALL of your music?", "topic_list": ["K-Pop Companies", "Choreography", "Music Production", "K-Pop Idols", "K-Pop Artists and Groups", "K-Pop", "Music Industry", "Companies", "Music"], "no_of_view": "415", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["There are a lot of companies that allow you to produce and choreograph as you please but under certain circumstances.\nCompanies like JYPE, YG, BigHit, Pledis, Starship, Cube, RBW almost all Kpop companies allow you to do this but only if the quality meets their standards and often times their standards are quite high (but that\u2019s what the trainee process is for). What ends up happening often times (especially if it\u2019s a stricter company like SM) is that they don\u2019t often trust young trainees or rookies 100% to \u201cdo it on their own\u201d so if someone truly has a passion for producing music or creating choreography they have to prove themselves exceptionally talented in said field, they let them do a trial run maybe working on smaller projects in trainee evaluations or bside tracks before debut but if said person fails to impress time and time again with no signs of improvement, the chances are much lower that they will be able to work on these things as much as they would like to once debuted.\nGroups like Stray Kids and Seventeen kind of showed this process in their predebut shows. BTS showed some of this process in their predebut vlogs. These groups are self producing because they have members who are very talented in that area and are proven to be reliable in these areas according to the company they are under.\nAn example, the ceo, JYP is known for dance thus the artists under the company are a reflection of this so Stray Kids members proved themselves to be very talented in both producing music and choreography however JYP is very strict with choreography so while he gives them complete freedom to do what they want with the music, often times if they have an idea for choreography some of it is used but the parts that aren\u2019t approved or don\u2019t meet standards by JYP get changed.\nSeventeen\u2019s company is just crap and Seventeen deserves better. So if you ask me they are grateful for the talent that falls into their laps because if Seventeen weren\u2019t so talented at being a self sufficient group in both producing and creating amazing choreography they probably wouldn\u2019t have made it as far as they did with what little Pledis did for them.\nOverall, the BEST company that someone would have the best chance at producing or choreographing regardless of standards in my opinion would be BRAND NEW MUSIC.\nA truly, underrated company.\nThey are mainly a hip hop company but have started taking in more idol trainees recently. The only idol group they have debuted thus far is AB6IX who are able to do whatever the hell they want with their music and choreography. It\u2019s a very nice company and one of the very few companies where the rookie groups debut with NO TRAINEE DEBT. The CEO of said company has stated that he wants his rookie groups to wholeheartedly be able to express themselves and hopefully succeed on their own without the burden of a debt they created while working hard to debut.

The way I answer questions is I give some context on my opinion before answering the question. I\u2019m not hating on blackpink or saying they\u2019re overrated, I'm saying their songs are. I think that they are quite talented, just the songs they are given are repetitive and aren\u2019t unique. I'm not gonna compare them to another group\u2019s songs, just an FYI.\nIntroduction\nWhat is the most overrated blackpink song? The easy answer is most of them. Especially the ones with mvs. Blackpink songs have the same format and are all basically the same song with similar lyrics. I will explain that later In this long post.\nWhat makes something overrated?\nWell according to google it means: to have a higher opinion of (someone or something) than is deserved. In order for a song to be overrated, it has to be overhyped and not have anything unique or special about it. (if that makes sense?) The reason why Blackpink songs are almost all overrated because they all follow a format, a pattern if you will.\nWhat makes blackpink\u2019s songs overrated?\n(BTW this is all from a video, that I can\u2019t find anymore)\nWell, as I said before, the format does. The format of all blackpink\u2019s choruses is some primary phrase, some sort of onomatopoeia, and a looped beat. Let\u2019s take ddu-du-ddu-du, for example. The entire beginning beats are all just 4\u20135 beats on a loop, this continues throughout the song, btw. The chorus has the same beats as the beginning, only slightly modified. The primary phrase is \u201chit you with that ddu du ddu du\u201d, the onomatopoeia is \u201cah yea ah yea\u201d. You may say this is only one song. Well, I\u2019ll also cover boombahyah. In the beginning, you hear the repeated EDM beats in a loop, and then throughout the song, you hear that same beat but modified. In the chorus, the primary phrase: \u201cboombahyah\u201d, onomatopoeia: \u201cyea yea\u201d, same EDM beats, nothing really different. You see the reoccurring theme here? It\u2019s the same format of some sort of beat, repeated over the course of the song, it basically makes it all the same songs, just with different beats.\nThis makes their songs overrated because every time people say, \u201cwow this song is so different\u201d and hype it all up. This is overrated because its hyping something up that is not special and, in the end, doesn't deserve all its hype. The songs wouldn\u2019t be so overrated if blinks didn\u2019t hype everything that blackpink did. The format is fine, a lot of groups have a format. But it starts to become a problem when it takes close to a year for each comeback, and each time the comeback is basically the same song remixed. And then, on top of that, blinks hype it up because they are so deprived of content, that as soon as content reaches them, they think its great no matter how repeated it is.\nWhat is the most overrated song of blackpink\u2019s?\nEasily, ddu du ddu du. It has 1.1B views for something that isn\u2019t very different from the rest of their songs.\nCLOSING STATEMENT/SUMMARY\nAt the end of the day, blackpink doesn\u2019t choose their songs, and it is not okay to hate on them for their music. Blackpink\u2019s entire discography is literally just one format applied to different EDM beats.\nhi.\n-E.", "Definitely KILL THIS LOVE, I felt like it was very similar to DDU-DU DDU-DU, it\u2019s just very boring and the chorus seems very low effort (at least to me). It was kind of overhyped probably because they hardly ever have any comebacks.", "Kill This Love and Ddu Du are extremely overrated. Lots of people rave about them because it's because their newer songs and they are very popular right now, but those song's just aren't good.\nI think underrated songs of theirs are Stay and Playing with Fire, there's a nice show of vocals and talent in both songs and their nice to listen to. Whereas with Ddu Du and Kill This Love, I just don't get the hype.", "in my opinion, it\u2019s kill this love.\nthis song is honestly not special \u2014 jennie & lisa\u2019s rapping skills aren\u2019t adequately showcased, ros\u00e9 is forced to sing too high-pitched which isn\u2019t good for her, and jisoo, as always, isn\u2019t given enough lines. for me, the song is annoyingly repetitive and not memorable at all.\ni\u2019m saying this as a blink, btw ; i really love bp but this is honestly a disappointing comeback :c", "Blackpink has 13 songs out of which 9 use a formula. A popular formula might I add. A large amount of starved Blinks overhype everything done by Blackpink.\nBut if I had to choose one song it would be DDU-DU DDU-DU. It was mid-2018 and Blackpink had only released ONE SONG in 2017, people were excited, to say the least.\nSquare Up, Blackpink\u2019s first mini-album, was a mass hit. Including DDU-DU DDU-DU as the title track.\nAs of April 2020, the music video has 1.1 billion views. DDU-DU DDU-DU was kind of the song that broke Blackpink into the west as well. BTS had released Love Yourself: Tear the previous month and it wild in the west. Now people were waiting for the next Kpop comeback to sink their teeth into. That comeback was DDU-DU DDU-DU.\nI hope this helped.\nAraminta Emerson, Once, Reveluv, Blink, MooMoo, ARMY.", "In my opinion, it\u2019s probably As If It\u2019s Your Last.

Use a reactive load box.\nIt absorbs all of the power coming from poweramps without the need for a cab as the resistance, so you can turn it to 10 and it will act as if it were a cab with speakers, with the difference that there is no cab and speakers.\nThen you can attach your favorite cab, and control the output from the load box, feeding the cab.\nThis way you have your amp running at max volume, while being really quiet, but it has a Con: it doesn\u2019t feel like a really cranked amp. But let this to the elitists who think that putting a tube screamer into the preamp is cheating.\nIndeed, you actually can put a tube screamer without having to pay for an (expensive) reactive load box. Again this is not like a cranked tube amp.\nAnother way is to have a Kemper/Fractal hi-gain profile running into a poweramp + cab. Again, this is not for elitists and you\u2019re free to use the setup that most serves to your songs.", "Many many amps have only a volume control.\nMany man newer amps have a gain control and a volume control.\nthe gain control will increase the preamp distortion sound..\nthe volume control will push the power tubes into overdrive.\nYou can\u2019t overdrive preamp tubes and get the same sound. usually described as a crunch.\nthink of preamp sound pushed hard as sand pouring down a metal slide.\nyou know. fuzz!\nthink of overdrive sound as power tubes pushed and gravel sliding down a metal slide.\ncrunch!\nSo. you can\u2019t. You can fuzz it out if you have a gain control.\npush the gain up, set the volume low. and there you go.\nZZTOP!\n(ok only sorta)\nsomething you can do to get closer is look at your speaker specs.\ndb sensitivity. the lower it is, the harder the amp will have to work to get loud. So a low rated db sensitivity amp will give you overdrive at lower volume.\nThe other way is usually done with a pedal. they are overdrive and distortion.. you can choose. best to try them out, or search pedals with sound clips.. maybe at the store or on you tube.\nI build my own amps and pedals so I\u2019m good to go.\nTWANG", "If your amp has a MASTER KNOB: Turn Master on 0.

I am wondering if you can saturate the tube when it is at a .5 watt setting at a much lower volume and if that is the whole point of the settings.\nSorry to answer your question with more questions, but it is all about learning in the final analysis.\nCheers", "The majority of tube amps have a Vol/Gain knob for each channel, then a Master vol. For an overdriven sound you crank up the channel Vol/Gain and turn down the Master volume - even single channel amps such as the Fender Blues Jnr have this.\nThere are some amps without a Master vol eg. the Fender Pro Jnr just has a Volume and Tone, which is a budget step too far. In this case you\u2019d have to get the overdrive from a pedal such as a Tubescreamer.", "You either need a tube amp with a master volume which lowers the gain into the power amp (so your preamp does all the distortion but output is low) - this requires an amp that has a preamp voiced for this, e.g. Mesa/boogie, or it could sound harsh/unpleasant. Alternatively you can add a power soak between the amp and the speaker.

Besides, Germany still uses Deutschlandlied.", "It was Putin\u2019s decision to change the lyrics of the Soviet anthem and adopt it as the new anthem for Russia. After he came to power, Putin set off to \u201crebrand\u201d Russia and distance it from Yeltsin\u2019s Russia in both locals and foreigners\u2019 perception. This new Russia was an independent hegemony, a political and military heavyweight. For Putin, one of the ways to restore Russians\u2019 pride in their country which had been weakened in the \u201ctough 1990s\u201d was to remind them of the glory of the country they were citizens of until only a decade ago - the USSR. As one of the ways to do it, Putin opted for adopting the Soviet anthem as the new Russian anthem by changing the lyrics.\nHow do I feel about it as a citizen of another former Soviet Republic, Azerbaijan? Honestly, I am not very much fond of it. After the collapse of the USSR, newly independent states agreed to recognize Russia as the successor of the USSR. That is why Russia inherited the USSR\u2019s seat in the UN Security Council, the nuclear weapons program of the USSR etc. However, outside the former Soviet space, one important point is always missed: While Russia was indeed the core of the USSR, still they weren\u2019t interchangeable. While all Soviet nations recognized Russia\u2019s primary role, for them, back then and now, the USSR and Russia are not equal. Equaling them is ignoring other Soviet Republics and nations. This distinction is missed in the West. Therefore, I and many other people feel offended when we are told in the West that our countries were \u201cpart of Russia\u201d. The USSR was different from the British or the French Empires, and from the Tsarist Russia as well. Communists had relegated Russia\u2019s role. Therefore, when Russia adopts the Soviet anthem, for me, it seems unfair to adopt the anthem of a country that was made up by many states - not just Russia. There have been concerns over Russia taking to itself almost all the credits for the Soviet\u2019s victory in WW2. This issue evokes a similar irritation. We do not want to go back to the USSR but all that belonged to it are the common heritage of all former Soviet nations - not just Russians even though they were kind of the \u201cbiggest shareholder\u201d. Yet, they did not have all the shares.\nAlso, of course, this step at the time sent signals of neo-imperialist ambitions of Russia to restore the USSR. Obviously, this is unwelcoming for many in the former Soviet space."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Vahe Demirjian", "view_list": [18, 17, 5, 90]}, "920": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 6, "name_list": ["Malcolm Kogut", "John Bruss", "Diane Harder", "Jake Guthmiller", "David LaDeau", "Peggy Krise"], "question_title": "Why do we worship with music?", "topic_list": ["Religious Worship", "Worship and Worshipping", "Music", "Religion"], "no_of_view": "1,309", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "ans_list": ["People go to church to be healed.

Sooner or later, many electric players will learn this practical skill\u2026\nThe thirty bucks or so it takes for tools is covered by the first time you don\u2019t need a pro shop\u2026 Like for a popped wire to your guitar\u2019s output jack, or a wire loose from a control pot, or improving shielding inside the control cavity, or changing out a broken end on an instrument cable, etc. But I digress.\nBut if you gather six pedals, ya end up with six power supplies, a mess of cables, and a need to get a \u201cpower strip\u201d (or two) to plug them all into. And few who play electrics with a pedal ever stop at just one\u2026 So, back to the store\u2026\nSomewhere around three pedals, look at multi-pedal power supplies. Some pedal makers market these, but, again, the polarity may not match what you need. But, since 9V/150ma DC is the same no matter which brand, we\u2019re just back to cables. Per the above.\nPersonally, I used a multi-outlet for many years, with a batch of self-made cables to supply a half-dozen different makes of pedals. Original single wall-warts, if any, got tossed in a box. Still kept a couple of lithium 9V\u2019s with me on the road, just in case (and for my sweet tuner).\nYou too can do it. Inhale enough solder and life gets simple.", "No it will not. I\u2019m not 100%!sure, but it\u2019s possible that you could damage your pedal by trying. Just buy the correct power supply, or use a battery. Here is one of my pedals, it works with a standard power supply. If yours doesn\u2019t look like this, I would look up the pedal on the manufacturers website and see what power supply they recommend.", "No, absolutely not. This is one of the best ways to turn your nice guitar pedal into an expensive paperweight.\nBecause most effects pedals operate off of DC current rather than AC, it is very important to use the correct power supply with the recommended specifications. This is typically labeled either on the bottom of the unit, or next to the power supply connector, or both.\nUsing the incorrect power supply can easily result in some nice sparks and smoke if the components are pushed past their tolerances, which will be much more expensive to repair. If in doubt, contact the manufacturer, and they will be happy to suggest the correct power supply for your use.", "Dude, Music is so much more than this. Please get a fucking clue", "You mean a positive centre adapter instead of a negative centre one?\nNo.\nNot only no, but I can't guarantee your pedals' safety if you try.\nYou must always match the polarity and voltage specified on the pedal, and use a power supply rated at a high enough amperage (usually measured in milliamps or mA) to match or exceed the requirement on the pedal. Give a pedal more voltage than it's designed for and you might blow it up. Give it too little and it won't work properly (analogue pedals sometimes don't work properly in interesting ways\u2026).\nAmperage is the only one that doesn't need an exact match- the pedal won't draw any more current than it needs, so as long as your power supply is rated for at least the same amount of milliamps the pedal needs (but ideally quite a bit more) it'll work fine.\nIt's well worth investing in a dedicated audio power supply, if only because it'll be less likely to introduce noise in to your signal. Something like the Truetone One Spot is relatively cheap but effective. Get it as a bundle with a daisy chain cable and some adapters for different DC jacks and you'll be all set.", "Probably not, though I once plugged a Line six AC power supply into a Roland keyboard (that needs a DC supply) and it worked (must\u2019ve rectified it its self!)\nIf you\u2019re not using the \u201cwrong\u201d power supply for anything, you could cut the cord and re-solder with the polarity reversed."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Alex Andrisca", "view_list": [47, 59, 46, 5, 88, 74]}, "291": {"no_of_follower": 2, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Albana Prishtina"], "question_title": "Do you think we albanians have good music?", "topic_list": ["Albanian Ethnicity and People", "Albania", "Music", "Survey Question"], "no_of_view": "747", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["Why not.\nWhile i\u2019m sad that some Albanian songs that, according to me, are beautiful, like this one\ndon\u2019t have the attention of many Albanians, i like also some of those songs that have million of views and are considered hits.\nAnd, it isn't true that only Kosovo produce those songs.There are many songs from Albania that are hits in the Albanian world.

I think part of this is the image of the tortured young quixotic artist, fighting the system, is more saleable than the established and rich one remembering their past. There are certainly more issues with being young and poor than being old and successful.\nThere is a certain amount of confirmation bias within this. It\u2019s possible to say that great rock and pop music is made by younger artists, but the industry promotes those artists. Also, historically, artists released far more material in the past when albums made up most of the revenue, and tours promoted album sales. These days the opposite is true, so far less music is released. The Beatles released 12 studio albums in under 7 years. Ed Sheeran has released 4 albums in 8 years.\nCertainly there is a quality in the material of people who are young and hungry that is lacking once an artists is an established one. The idea of writing songs about missing your \u2018baby\u2019, or struggling to pay the rent if you're a 60 year old rock star in one of your mansions on your 4th marriage is a little hypocritical.\nBut that does ignore the great music produced by older artists, writing interesting and age appropriate songs. There was some criticism of Kate Bush when she did her one set of live gigs in 2014, and based these on her later works. She came to stage dressed as a 56 year old woman, and sang songs that worked in her established eccentric catalogue; the idea that she may have come on wearing stockings and singing Babooshka is ludicrous, and would be like Mick Jagger complaining he can\u2019t get no satisfaction, or Roger Daltrey stating he hopes he dies before he gets old.\nThere are artists who older singing songs that fit their current image, and much of it is great. Bowie\u2019s last two albums deal with ageing and dying; Springsteen still manages to write about the issues he sees in modern USA. There are others still making great music, that isn\u2019t being promoted, but is interesting and thought provoking. It may not be as raw and cutting as their earlier work, but that, surely, is the point of being an older writer."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Camille .Moore", "view_list": [20, 2, 58, 82]}, "1029": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What is the name of a musical which starred or was created by a professional dance couple or dancers from strictly come dancing or dancing with the stars?", "topic_list": ["Dancing With the Stars (TV series)", "Dancers", "Musical Theatre", "Dance (activity)", "Music"], "no_of_view": "210", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Kevin Chung", "view_list": []}, "320": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What is Brian Teasley (Birdstuff), the drummer from Man\u2026 or AstroMan?

Cause other members are horrible at freestyle and general dance or if they out of their music video concepts\u2026\nNow comes the Prince himself. JIN a.k.a Worldwide Handsome!!!

He\u2019s number one!! get it!?\nNow lemme ask u something. Imagine you\u2019re in a famous band. You go through your Instagram or twitter or Youtube\u2026 and you see videos that say \u2018how other members are better than y/n\u2019 (something like that). How would you feel? Would u feel nice to get squashed by your own fandom? No right? It hurts. Terribly.\nI\u2019m just trying to say\u2026 Treat everyone equally. I know most of ya\u2019ll have your own biases but still\u2026 that doesnt mean that you\u2019ll just eradicate the rest. Be a true ARMY. Instead of putting the members down\u2026 raise them. Make them feel good. They must be already receiving so much hate from the haters. So why should their own ARMY family hurt them.

The problem is that SM is the one managing them and let me tell you, SM sucks at managing Kpop groups. If SM can manage them better, they would have been even more popular.\nNCT is really talented though. They don't ever follow the trends, they always make the trends. Their songs are so unique and diverse, they literally have a huge variety of concepts.\nNot to mention that NCT is one of the most diverse groups out there. Their songs won't appeal to you at the beginning, but once you actually listen and pay attention to their songs, you'll get to know how amazing they actually are.\nMore than their songs, their personalities are amazing. They're crackheads, all of them are crazy. Their visuals ? Off the charts.

Wherever you are , neo -soul songs will still use elements like percussion , synthesiser , guitar with main focal point being the vocals .\nMost k-pop fans don't seem to be aware of the fact that k-pop is NOT a genre rather an umbrella term for what constitutes k-pop and is heavily influenced by western sounds.\nIf you have to ask me about BTS' music , they LOVE fusing different sounds with Hiphop being their base.\nNow the second point.\nDepending on the amount of western music a person has listened , they will or will not hear the influence in BTS songs or in general kpop songs .\nFor me , I can hear it in almost ALL BTS songs especially their older albums.\nI think people don't listen to much music outside of pop or music outside of the current decade thus not having enough knowledge .\nThird point .\nWhen BTS changed their sound when they transitioned into the hyyh era from the school series ( more hip hop based ) , they started using more of EDM .\nNot many had a problem with this although the hyyh - wings era use MORE of EDM compared to the love yourself .The love yourself era had much more musical diversity compared to any of their previous eras .\nFire\nSave me\nDope\nBlood sweat and tears ( moombahton is a form of edm music )\nOutro wings\nCypher pt 4\nI NEED U\nBegin\nNot today\u2026 I could go on\nNow some people weren't able to resonate with their music when love yourself her came out.\nTheir music became more brighter and mellow . They were no longer making emo sad music .\nApparently listening to 'Dark and Wild ' has become an edgy personality trait for a lot of people .\nPeople thought they became 'westernised' just beacause they entered the American music market.\nBut think about it , the love yourself :her album must have been prepared / discussed about way before they were invited to the US or before they BLEW up after its release .\nFourth point\nI seriously doubt whether people listen to what BTS themselves have to say .\nThey had stated that they don't want to make music that is just emo sad. They have changed / matured as people and they have a different outlook on certain things and that reflects in their music . ( Grammy museum interview ) .\nRm also said in that same interview that they took a big risk when they did the ly series cause their music style changed . They have stated they are an experimental group and WILL NOT be going back to any of their previous eras. We only get glimpses from their previous eras but not the exact same thing . They still pay homage to their older album sounds even if it is not that prominent in EVERY ALBUM. Every album has atleast one song that sounds like a song that would fit one of their previous album but people are not open minded enough to listen .\nOutro her and gogo from ly her\n134340 and anpanman from ly tear\nI am fine from ly answer\nDionysus , persona , home from mots persona\nRespect from mots 7\nSome fans keep expecting them to go back to their previous eras and when it dosent happen or something totally different is presented , they feel disappointed . They expect too much .\nNext point\nThe BTS hate train.\nSome people just like to hop on the bandwagon train because it makes them look cool .\nSome people are not happy that BTS rose to fame . They liked them when they were not popular .\nFurthermore to justify their feelings towards BTS , people would be ready to form any kind of uninformed opinion no matter how much ever people keep barking straight up facts .\nLast point\nAgain this one is related to the previous one .\nJust because BTS didn't meet THEIR expectations they think they are undeserving or everything that they put out is trash .\nSome international fans have a certain notion of how k-pop should be . They keep demanding and demanding without realising that their rules don't apply .\nI feel like this is mostly international fans .\nBTS are basically titled as pride of the nation . I think they are very much respected in South Korea.\nThey bring in a lot of economic benefits to the country through tourism and their music . Who is heavily promoting Hangul right now ?\nI dont want to say this , but just because BTS' work dosent fit certain people's narrative/ tastes , there are people who take this as an opportunity and just bitch about everything that they put out . They are never satisfied . If you ask me , there is no such thing as \u201cwestern\u201d touch . Anyone with basic music knowledge would know this .\nPS 1 - If we are really going to talk about western touch , then BTS\u2019 music is far far veeeeery far away from that . The foundation of their songs itself is traditional. Plus their songs are in Korean .\nPS 2- Tell me have you heard a song like Dionysus , persona , ON, black swan , respect , ego ..made by western artists ?\nPS 3 - People who say that their music is generic , I will have to slap a dictionary right in your faces . Also you have to be more specific ? Generic in terms of what ? Structure ? Melody ? Beats ? You know a song has a lot of components .\nPS 4 - Point 3 applied to the word \u201cmainstream\u201d as well . I will give an example of mainstream .\nIn 2019 , the mainstream stuff in k-pop was all the dark songs with hard hitting edm drops . Bwl was a breath of fresh air .\nNow , bwl is generic when it comes to the structure of a typical funky pop song .", "K-Pop Is Known As This Song\nBut Non Koreans Think This Is What K-pop \u201cIs\u201d But Actually There Is 20 To 40 Different Types Of K-pop And Real K-Pop Stan's Think K-Pop Is So Much More And Their Right There Are All So Many Haters Out Their And Hate On It And Maybe A Used To Be K-Pop Fan Hates K-Pop Why You May Ask Well Because A Lot Of K-Pop Fans Like Chill K-Pop Song\u2019s And Their Wearing A Red Dress Or Black Suit With Heels Or Men Shoes (Whatever There Called Lol) And They Like That, The Mind Does Not Like Somethings Ok And The Mind Likes Other Thing And The K-Pop Stan Hates The Next Era ( A Era Is new single or album, i.e enters a new 'era'.

I am a Classical Guitarist. Because of the current coronovirus situation the graduation ceremony at New England Conservatory was cancelled. To lift the graduates spirits they are putting together a virtual orchestra where everyone records their part at home. They sent me the entire orchestral score although I played \u201c Pomp.and Circumstance\u201d many times in high school and college orchestra s, I never heard the beginning fanfare section we never played that part in high school. They also sent me a click track( metronome) and a click track with first violin. There were three free measures at the beginning where I was to start recording and count out loud. I actually did not start playing my part until two minutes into the piece I had to count measures and it was helpful to listen to the violin part in my headphones so it would not bleed into my recording. It was a fun project and I am anxious to hear the final result next month.

It is interesting to know that Ace Maestro Naushad started his innings at Lucknow with this type of bands under Ustad Babban Khan and Yusuf Ali Khan. This practice later paid him high dividends that he emerged as most authentic background music composer.\nWhen sound was added later from film Alam Ara even then there were no music directors.

Background music was done by the foreigners.\nRC Boral, Shyam Sunder, Puknaj Mullick and Anil Biswas were the early batch of Music directors but they did not have any status. Even their credits appeared in chorus and no special slide was used for them. There were no playbacks also. Songs were recorded on actor singers during the shooting in one take after making several rehearsals. The music scene was dominated by Rabindra Sangeet and later some Muslim music directors added Punjabi lure when production started in Bombay and Lahore. Ustad jhande Khan, Ghulam Haider, Mushtaq Ahemd etc were the prominent music directors.\nIt was Anil Biswas who first grasped the nuances of Western music in films like harmony, counter melody, and other styles. A hit film of that era was Kismat that ran for three years with success.\nNaushad joined the scene. He accepts the contribution of Anil Biswas in training and helping in in early stage as his mentor. There was mono recordings on one track. The Cutler Feeder microphone required to be heated for some time before it could pick up. Naushad brought Hindustani music ( the folk music of Uttar Pradesh). His film Rattan was a super hit. The entire cost of the film was Rs 75000 but it earned royalty of music only for Rs, 3,50000.

Pitch intervals are composed of notes that vibrate at specific frequencies. Because notes vibrate in the medium of transmission, usually air, they can interact. That interaction is called consonant or dissonant depending on how much of the energy of the two \u201cparent\u201d vibrations goes into the \u201coffspring\u201d vibration. The less energy, the more consonant; the more energy the more dissonant. As each pitch interval of any chord produces this third \u201coffspring\u201d vibration (except the tonic - octave interval which produces no third vibration at all and is perfectly consonant) they all interact. The multiple interactions are what produce a set of vibrations which can be judged consonant or dissonant.\nThere are two aspects to consonance and dissonance; objective and subjective. The objective aspect is that every pitch interval produces a definite amount of dissonance, from zero (tonic - octave or Do-Do) to a lot (staying with the western equal temperament scale of 12 semitones) that would be the tonic - augmented 4th interval, sometimes referred to as the tritone. This phenomenon can be seen as a graphic display on an oscilloscope and has nothing to do with whether a given person enjoys or is repulsed by a given chord.\nThe subjective aspect is what a person likes when it comes to consonance and dissonance. When I was young, I delighted in consonant intervals and detested dissonance; now I prefer a judicious blend of both as relentless consonance is boring and relentless dissonance is irritating.", "Unresolved tension between two or more pitches in the chord. This is a result of two or more tones that are a half or whole step apart, or that are the inversion of those intervals, major and minor sevenths. Any diminished or augmented intervals within a chord also causes dissonance.", "Anything that doesn\u2019t belong to the harmonic series", "It\u2019s rather subjective -\nthat being said, it really comes down to intervals. Some intervals play well together and some don\u2019t. (Almost literally based on how often their waves crest and trough together, this is called interference and may be worth checking out).\nFor example: A perfect 5th is consonant and when played with a root makes a nice consonant chord. If you use a tritone with the root it\u2019s by and large more dissonant.\nSo one thing to consider are the intervals involved. Now what makes it a bit more complicated is when you add more and more intervals to your chord\u2026\nYou have to consider their distance from the root, AND their distance from one another.\nFor example, half steps are often considered more dissonant. You could play an \u2018A minor 7 9 chord\u2019 with this voicing : A B C E G this will be a crunchier voicing than spacing the B and C further apart. A C E G B\nNow we have nice spaced out thirds from one another instead of a half step (or minor 2nd)between the B and the C. This may sound better or not to people, but the literal interference between the half step is audible, especially in lower ranges.\nThis is one example of how the perceived dissonance of a chord is affected by all intervals involved.\nTldr: If you\u2019re a beginner, here\u2019s my list of scary intervals: minor 2nd, tritone, minor 6th. Make a chord and put a bunch of these intervals in it. It will be dissonant (to most people) Also I should add that context helps as well, a passing diminished chord probably sounds wayyy sweeter than a 32bar diminished chord ; )", "Not an easy thing to answer.

That\u2019s exactly whet it feels like.\nas you breathe out try and create the support for each note you sing in this way The higher the note the lower the base of support- The lower the note the higher the support. Or put it another way when you sing low relax more, when you sing high tense muscles lower and lower in your torso.And each note requires a tiny almost imperceptibly different amount of air pressure or air speed . But don\u2019t worry or think about this - it happens naturally if you let the body do it and don\u2019t think about it or try to achieve it in a conscious way.\npractice support by lying down and breathing in, relax and notice your tummy go up. Do not tense but at the end of the in breath try to get your tummy muscles to gently and gradually push the air out.", "Try this\u2026\u2026hold the palm of your hand on your stomach and when you sing, push against your stomach and force the air through.

If it sounds like your normal conversation seems a bit forced, keep doing it After a short time, it will be a part of your normal breathing.

But in case you still don\u2019t understand, this song is about a girl who got cheated on, her boyfriend never keeps his promise. However, she moved on almost immediately, showed some savageness, and, in my opinion, portrays the look of a very independant, strong and powerful girl. Some lyrics such as: \u201cI will throw you away\u201d,\u2026 shows all her savageness. Hope this helps!", "hmmm\u2026 as far as I know though I may be wrong as I consider myself to not be as dedicated fan as some other people might be which is definitely OK. But I do have my own reasons for that which is basically that often I have too much on my plate or am busy with something else( hobbies, competitions, family etc.:) and can\u2019t afford to use all my time to stay updated on \u201cLiterally\u201d everything that black pink do, every time. Plus I am also a Multi-Stan which I don\u2019t think I have to explain much about but Multi-Stan's do have lot\u2019s of variety and content to watch, obviously which is another reason for why I may have the \u201cwrong information\u201d or wasn\u2019t updated about something. Anyways that was a pretty big disclaimer so let\u2019s move on to the actual answer.\nSo first, I searched for the meaning behind the song on google, yeah I know, you probably asked this here because the results that may show up on google aren\u2019t always right and want to trust someone who is more experienced and can give you the correct answer Or you were like me and searched the exact thing on google but didn\u2019t find any video\u2019s of interviews where black pink themselves or someone from YG( anyone who you can trust that they will give you the exact meaning of the song) have explained the meaning behind the song or something similar like that and only got the English translations of the song.\nWhy may that be a bad thing you ask? It isn\u2019t I guess because everyone\u2019s perspective is different so everyone interprets these translations differently, which may be cool in a way because you can attach your own meaning to the song, but I guess it may be awkward if someone asks you the meaning of this song or I guess it may also lead to a fan war, I can already imagine an army telling blinks that BTS are superior because they actually have meanings in their songs, now before anyone comes at me, I am not saying that army\u2019s are like this, it can be anyone and I am also not saying that I want armies and blinks to fight(never!), I am saying just in case and it isn\u2019t a bad thing to not have actual lyrics to songs.\nI guess the above answers your question if you were looking for the \u201cexact meaning of the song\u201d. The reason I don\u2019t think black pink do have a exact meaning to their songs because they have said before that their producers write the lyrics for them and they just embody it so the only thing you have to work with are the English lyrics(But it isn\u2019t anything to be sad about. Take a look at BTS, even though do tell their fans the exact meaning of their songs, plenty of their songs meanings can be guessed from the english translations as well. Idol is an example).

I would appreciate the help and will correct it.\ud83d\ude0a) so if you don\u2019t understand, I will give you my interpretation of the translation but if you are still confused, I will personally recommend you to check out Janny\u2019s (youtuber) English cover of the song, even though it may not be a translation, I think it conveys the message much better or you can check out videos on you tube with the song\u2019s translation on them.\nSo judging from the lyrics, I will guess that this song is related to a girl who has recently broken-up with her partner who is a player, has cheated or has probably broken up with her for someone else and in general is not a good person. And this song this about how she realized from that experience that she was with the wrong person the entire time and now that she has recovered from the break-up, everything has been changed completely for the better. Now that she thinks back about it, she realized how much of a loser that guy was or maybe she is showing the guy what he has lost\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude06.\nWow!, that was long and I am so sorry for that.\nBut Anyways\u2026.\nHope that answered your question.\nCheers,\nMe.", "I read an English translation, here is what I think it means:\nI\u2019ll throw you away recycle\nThe girl next to you is an idiot\nI\u2019ll tell you today\nI don\u2019t want you no more\nThey are over a past relationship.\nSee u later boy see u later\nSee u later boy see u later later\nSee u later boy see u later\nSee u later maybe never\nThey are going to NEVER see that ex again.\nSavage.\n:)", "About a breakup.\nShe was in a relationship and did her best, but now she doesn\u2019t care anymore and couldn\u2019t be more done with him.

She also began acting at the same time and dabbled with various guest starring roles until she was cast as in the biopic about Karen Silkwood Silkwood (1983)\nwhere she acted opposite Meryl Streep and garnered critical acclaim for her performance as the colleague and friend of the employee of a plutonium processing plant who had possibly been murdered to prevent her from exposing worker safety violations at the plant where they had worked. When Cher won her Oscar for Moonstruck (1987)\nfour years later, she paid tribute to Meryl Streep in her acceptance speech [2](see 4:20). Along the way, she has become an icon in LGBTQ community and often plays it up in television shows like Will & Grace (TV Series 1998\u20132020)\nwhere she alluded to her iconic status in a chance meeting with one of the characters.\nCynthia Erivo\nAlthough she is just getting started, she is well on her way to legendary status having won a Tony Award in 2016 in the best actress category for her role as Celie Harris Johnson in The Color Purple. She also won a Grammy in 2017 in the best musical theater album category for the same role and won a Daytime Emmy Award later that year for her performance on Today alongside her The Color Purple castmates. She has won wide acclaim for her performance as Harriet Tubman in the movie Harriet (2019)\nculminating in her Oscar nomination (she lost out to Renee Zellweger) and she also starred as Aretha Franklin in analogy series Genius (TV Series 2017\u2013 )\ntracing Ms Franklin\u2019s life and career from her early beginnings.

Unlike guitars, where the maker\u2019s name is almost always clearly labeled and there\u2019s usually a serial number to help determine date of manufacture, many violins are not so labeled and there\u2019s no easy way for a layperson to determine the maker and age.", "Sorry, you don't have a Strad.\nStradivarius made around 1,100 instruments. About 650 survive today. They are all known to one degree or another. The likelihood of you finding an undiscovered Strad in a storage unit/grandma's attic/pawn shop is less than you getting stuck by lightning when you go to pick up your lottery jackpot winnings and then getting eaten by a shark.\nJust about every violin made has a famous makers name inside. Stradivarius being the most famous, the majority of instruments over the last 250 years have probably been made in his pattern. Guarneri, Stainer, and Amati are common names/patterns. It isn't/wasn't to deceive but to indicate the model.\nJust because it isn't a Strad doesn't mean it is worthless. Even mass produced violins from the 19th century can easily be worth over a thousand dollars, depending on quality and condition. On the other hand it may be another run of the mill student instrument with a retail price of $300 USD.\nThe only way to be sure is to take it to an expert to get an idea of what you have.

So, there is no need for a magic creature who lives in the sky to reveal an eighth note because we already have more than that available in our music. Very strange question.", "The idea of seven musical notes in a scale is not God-ordained\u2026at least any more than other ideas for scales.\nThe diatonic scale was originally an ancient Greek concept, having been restricted to \u201cGreek modes\u201d from the 4th century \u0299.\u1d04.\u1d07. to the Middle Ages.\nThe majority of early believers in Christ were considered Grecian, from the perspective of the Roman empire. So was the culture of the eastern half of that empire, which contained the province of Judea, as well as most of the other areas mentioned in the New Testament as having been missioned to.\nWith the proliferation of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches, then, came the proliferation of the diatonic scale in some form. The missions that proliferated them were usually sponsored by one monarchy or another: the Byzantine Empire for Orthodox missions; various western post-Roman kingdoms for Catholic ones. Just like their claimed predecessors, the Romans, these monarchies took to a colonialist attitude of belitting other societies and their cultures as necessarily primitive.\nIn other words, the diatonic scale\u2019s popularity is a product of power, not of any divine mandate.\nHonestly, the Lord loves whatever we have to give Him\u2014of whatever aesthetics\u2014just as long as we offer it with a pure and pretenseless heart.\nA fun fact, however, is said that most cultures actually conceive of the pentatonic scale first. This is the same scale as ancient Rome was using all that time: their uses always approximating C,D,F,G,A.\nIt could also be argued that without first knowing the pentatonic scale\u2019s F-C-G-D-A order of fifths, the Greeks would never have reached the diatonic\u2019s F-C-G-D-A-E-B.\nAdditionally, the chromatic scale (upon which all of traditional Western music has been based) has twelve notes. That is setting aside things like quarter-tones, as used in either of the two classical music traditions of the Indian subcontinent; and overtones, which for the most part defy twelve-tone equal temperament.", "This is a very interesting question! So let\u2019s start by talking about what we do know:\nThere are already scales with more than 7 notes. The reason we stick to diatonic scales are because they are directly derived from the physics of sound, and they are the first (and, hence, most prominent) tones generated in the mathematics of acoustics. Also, the human ear innately hears these tones before all other \u201cless obvious\u201d possible pitches. But there are plenty of scales that either \u201cremodel\u201d the intervals of pitches from the 12 chromatic notes we commonly have at our disposal (for instance, the octatonic scale\nis a derived scale that alternates whole and half steps; depending on how you start the alternation, it can actually be used to make some pretty cool tonal jazz settings), or rely on actual frequency modification for \u201cnotes,\u201d as in microtonal music. So finding an \u201c8th musical note\u201d is not hard\u2014depending on how you want to count it, it\u2019s been done already.\nThe Bible does not make a practice of discussing music theory. While there\u2019s some supposition that the \u201cselah\u201d in the book of Psalms gives guidance to performance practice (and this is largely conjecture), there\u2019s never any language about music from a structural standpoint such that an introduction of a \u201cnew note\u201d would have any meaning or value; it would be so far out of context for eschatological doctrine as to be more of a distraction than anything useful for spiritual growth (which is really the point of such texts\u2014to encourage right living now in view of what\u2019s to come).\nNow to the meat of your question (and considering your specific use of the word \u201cMessiah\u201d), I have to ask: what\u2019s youre perspective? I\u2019m a Christian, so my opinion is based on the notion that this is not Messiah\u2019s first visit to our little third rock from the sun. (Of course, I\u2019m not a Mormon, so I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s been back to visit the Native Americans, but that\u2019s an entirely other matter.) However, if you\u2019re Jewish, Yeshuah isn\u2019t really a \u201cthing\u201d for you and you\u2019re still waiting on the actual Messiah\u2026 except Jewish theology has long eschewed treating Isaiah and other Messianic texts as prophetic of an actual Messiah, choosing rather to interpret them as prophecies for the Jewish people, so \u201cMessiah watching\u201d probably isn\u2019t your speed. (If that\u2019s you, we\u2019ll just have to agree to disagree.)\nI\u2019m going to proceed from the assumption that you\u2019re asking after the Christian doctrine of \u201cthe second coming of Christ.\u201d\nThe New Testament states that the redeemed of the Lord will be \u201ccaught up\u2026 in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air\u201d (1 Thessalonians 4:17\n). At this point, there\u2019s some debate about where we go and when this happens, but Scriptures indicate that when this happens, we receive new bodies (1 Corinthians 15:51\u201353\n). What most theologians believe is that this does not speak of a new \u201cmode of existence\u201d that is fundamentally different than we have now\u2014that is, we will receive new physical bodies\u2014but will no longer have a sin nature. There are two important considerations that, in the context of this question, create bit of a tension with regard to certainties and possibilities as pertains to your question:\nWe will have physical bodies: that is to say, we won\u2019t be ephemeral \u201cghosts\u201d that have been \u201cabsorbed\u201d into some \u201cconsciousness that we call \u2018God\u2019\u201d or some whack New Age weirdness like that. This means there\u2019s no supposition that the laws of physics as we know them will suddenly stop (as the bodies we\u2019re in now, and presumably the ones we\u2019ll receive, were made for this physical universe as it is, only without the taint of sin.\nWe will be utterly perfect: this is more vague, because the Bible is (probably intentionally) silent on what exactly \u201cimperishable\u201d means beyond the obvious matter of \u201cno death or decay.\u201d\nWill we all be one race? Probably not; in Revelation 14:6\n, John saw \u201can angel flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people,\u201d and this is after Messiah has already physically appeared and is on the ground on Mt. Zion.\nWill we be genderless, or will there still be men and women? Jesus told the Sadducees in Matthew 22:30\n, \u201c[In] the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.\u201d And we know less about angel physiology!\nWill we have babies? There is far less evidence for this than against it: babies are a byproduct of marital love (which will be nullified, per the above point), but this speaks more about the deeper spiritual desire we will have for Jesus than any physical or emotional desire we will have for another person that there would be some urge to procreate.\nHere\u2019s the tension, especially with regards to music: while we will have physical bodies, we know that they will be superior to the bodies we have now. Could this include an ability to hear sounds in a physically perfect world that would organize in some kind of octatonic scale with modified frequencies that sound utterly foreign to us now, but will make sense \u201cwhen this corruptible puts on incorruptible\u201d? Maybe, but I doubt it.\nI think music has its emotional gravity\u2014its ability to penetrate and manipulate us and bypass the thought process with almost utter disregard\u2014because its very physics communicate to us that there is another plane of enjoying God\u2019s creation that our bodies just can\u2019t access yet. It\u2019s not like all music is perfect (believe me, you can launch Spotify and catch Miley Cyrus or Katy Perry and hear how simultaneously so beautifully close and horribly far we are in music composition and performance styles to music that is remotely perfect or in any way transcendent), but I do think the ability to quantify\u2014or even qualify\u2014music in scientific terms is elusive because it\u2019s not made to be understood by a fallen mind. As long as we have sin, we can recognize something that is sublime, but will never\u2014in these bodies such as they are\u2014be able to comprehend or fully appreciate it. We have trouble enough coming to a consensus on how to understand and discern good music now, so I\u2019m disinclined to think there\u2019s necessarily something wrong with the physics of music such that it needs an overhaul. It\u2019s our hearts, minds, and ears that need to be fixed!\nAll that is to say this: I don\u2019t think music needs a renovation, by adding another pitch or whatever. I think our understanding of the universe as God intended it will be complete, not that a new law of physics will necessarily come into play. But hey, that\u2019s just my thinking. I haven\u2019t been there yet, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m talking from experience; these are just my musings and are not more or less valuable that anyone else\u2019s.\nLet me just quote Paul from 1 Corinthians 13:12\non this: \u201cNow I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.\u201d"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Kevin James Durain", "view_list": [2, 16, 18, 30]}, "351": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Jax Maximus"], "question_title": "What is the mechanism in a music box called?", "topic_list": ["Music Boxes", "Mechanisms", "Music"], "no_of_view": "282", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["The ratchet lever [1] rotates the cylinder [2], the pins pluck the comb teeth [3] which produces the music.

They tend to have a more aggressive edge than most power metal groups, yet are heavily influenced by Queen in their guitar work and vocal layering.\nThat sounds weird, I know. But the end results of those two elements are epic songs that swell with emotion, from quiet contemplation to furious, roaring defiance. In the same vein, vocalist Hansi K\u00fcrsch can go from a fey-sounding croon to a ferocious scream within seconds, often utilizing a unique style that blends melodic singing with the gritty, harsh tones that characterize screams and growls.\nMy favorite of theirs is like Nightfall,[1]an amazing song that showcases the band\u2019s emotional range to phenomenal effect. It\u2019s really, really, really good stuff.\nAvantasia is another power metal band mainly from Germany. With a name like Avantasia you know the music\u2019s gonna be cheesy and bombastic, but it\u2019s executed in the very best way\u2014it\u2019s a power metal supergroup headed by Tobias Sammet, lead singer of Edguy. The lineup and overall sound changes each album, so there\u2019s something for everyone in Avantasia\u2019s catalogue: their sound ranges from crunchy hard rock to a strange, wonderful musical theater influenced power metal.\nSammet does crazy things with all the styles he chooses to play, and I really recommend diving into Avantasia\u2019s albums to find one you really like. My personal favorite is the musical theater-influxend stuff, and I don\u2019t even like musical theatre! It just creates a totally unique sound, and the band sells it 100%.\nI\u2019d recommend the songs The Story Ain\u2019t Over[2] , Devil in the Belfry,[3] Master of the Pendulum,[4] and Ghost in the Moon[5] for a good sample of the different styles the band plays.\nFinally, Summoning is an atmospheric black metal band out of Vienna. Now, I am not a black metal fan by any means. It\u2019s always sounded droning and off-putting and harsh and gross to my ears, but Summoning is different.\nThe atmosphere created by their pulsing drums, the sonic wall of synth and strings and guitar, the screamed vocals that feel muted and far away, and the flute thar cuts through everything else from time to time is just\u2026.incredibly free-sounding. It evokes a massive, multifaceted world, full of danger and adventure, life and death, glory and fear, love and loss. I\u2019ve never heard anything that stirs the kind of emotion the way Summoning\u2019s stuff does for me. It\u2019s near impossible to put into words. It really is like being transported to a differnt world, with just your ears.\nI haven\u2019t heard much of the band\u2019s music yet, I only discovered them a week ago. But I\u2019d recommend Beleriand[6] and The Land of the Dead[7] for sure. They have differnt vibes, but are both incredible pieces of music.\nFootnotes\n[1] http://like Nightfall,\n[2] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OwkhuUqlhoA\n[3] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BAO6BR9_3vg\n[4] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eHZZkRC1gbw&index=5&list=RDXt07-yfUdbo\n[5] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tYvZOe6cmeM\n[6] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WkdT2MGkWoY\n[7] Page on youtube.com", "Old skool: Definitely check out Accept(German)\u2026Balls to the Wall, Princess of the Dawn, Living for Tonight\u2026any( 80s ) old stuff is awesome.\nSlightly newer\u2026Ramstein \u2026.also German\u2026check out the entire wicked album called Sehnsucht\u2026.you willie si gong great German songs in no time lol.\n2 great American band that arent greatly known are Savatage\u2026check out albums: Sirens, Dungeons are Calling, and Hall of the Mountain King.

Otherwise, a stock Bigsby is a royal pain to restring.", "Your problem is that you are asking for the condition easily. As bad as some folks make it sound, it is just fussy because Bigsby uses those silly little pins onto which you must slip the ball end of the string. If they only had drilled chamfered holes into the roller rod (like many Bigsby clones & knockoffs did even way back in the 1960s) most of the hassle would be gone.\nAs it is, the \u201ctrick\u201d is pre-bending The string right behind the ball (where the string core is wrapped around itself) such that when you slip the hole in the ball end over the pin, it naturally wants to curve around the roller bar wher you cann catch it and put tension on it so it doesn\u2019t fall off the pin. That little trick alone can save you many headaches when you are in a hurry. Some players keep a mini needle-nosed pliers in their case for just this purpose. [Add 10 bonus points if you buy a quality small (not mini) needle-nosed pliers with a hardened steel cutter notch at the back of the jaws for clipping your strings after installation.]\nA second \u201ctrick\u201d is to use a dab of petroleum jelly on the ball end to temporarily stick the ball to the pin with a bit of goo. This will keep the ball on the pin long enough the thread the string around the roller, grab the free end, and pull to keep it under tension. If in conjunction with pre-bending The string, you\u2019ll rarely drop the end of the string off the pin and have to re-finesse it onto the pin. The petroleum jelly thing doesn\u2019t work when it\u2019s very warm, like in the middle of summer, unless you smear it on like butter\u2026but don\u2019t do that, please. You\u2019d regret the mess.\nAnother Quoran has suggested an aftermarket solution and I know the Vibra-mate product just works.

Typically mixing involves:\nGain staging - Making sure every vocal and most instruments have the same consistent volume throughout the whole song via gain automation.\nCompression - Correcting any volume inconsistencies that made it through your gain staging.\nEqualization - Removing or lowering specific frequencies that are too loud/bright(piercing)/muddy(ugly), or to just make room for other frequencies.\nSaturation - Essentially stretches out the frequency range for a specific sound, making it sound louder when it\u2019s really just more present.\nLimiting - It\u2019s basically a compressor that works way harder, used when you want to heavily balance a sound at the expense of dynamics(e.g. loud sounds and quiet sounds have the same volume, where as with a compressor, loud sounds and quiet sounds will be closer to each other, but you can still hear the volume differences). Many hip-hop producers only use a limiter on the master track when mastering or on heavy kicks and 808s.\nPitch Correction(Auto-Tune and Melodyne) - This one is a bit different than the others as it is more of a flavor effect than a \u201ctrack balancer.\u201d It\u2019s mostly used on vocals but can also be used to tune certain instruments, especially 808s.\nDe-esser - If you\u2019ve ever recorded you might have noticed that your T\u2019s and S\u2019s have a bright, piercing sound that most other letters do not have. You need a De-esser to reduce these piercing sounds, but not too reduced, otherwise you will sound like you have a lisp. You can also EQ out sibilance by hand if you do not have a de-esser, but I highly recommend one.\nNoise Gate - Gets rid of any sound below a certain threshold. If you have a fan going on in the background for example, it will cut off the fan and leave your voice. It only works to an extent though, as it will often only cut off parts when you\u2019re not talking. It can also be used on instruments.\nDelay - You could refer to a delay as an \u201cecho\u201d because that is what it is most of the time. It essentially just gives your vocals or instruments an echo effect or a doubling effect with no need to record additional lines.\nReverb - If you\u2019ve ever been in a church and noticed the echo when somebody is singing, that is reverb. It\u2019s not just any echo however, but an echo simulated according to the size of a room. The smaller the room, the shorter and less present the echo is.\nSo those are most of the terms used when referring to mixing. As for the actual mixing process, experiment! There are some general rules to follow when mixing, but there is not a formula to follow to give you the best mix for every single song. ALWAYS do pitch correction first, then your next two should always be either a compressor first, eq second, or eq first, compressor second. They both sound better or worse depending on your song, so try both or see which sounds better and stick with it! After these you have a lot more freedom to do what you like and it will be different for you, but for me, I like to use a de-esser afterwards, a multiband compressor such as soundgoodizer, OTT, or a manual one such as FabFilter\u2019s. After that I use saturation to make it a little louder. Noise gate afterwards, especially if you\u2019re a home studio artist, then last but not least, flavor effects such as delay and reverb(if you use both, make sure they don\u2019t collide too heavily). If you\u2019re a novice don\u2019t worry too much about additive and subtractive eq, but once you\u2019ve mastered everything else, i\u2019d recommend learning about them.\nIf you need to learn how to use these techniques, youtube is a good place to start and too complicated to type into a quora post. There are people who literally spend decades learning these techniques and are still learning new things.\nOn to mastering. Phew. You got past the hardest part, mixing! Mastering is in a nutshell just raising the volume of your track. Typically it only consists of limiting, glue compression(only sometimes!), and sometimes eq. For the sake of this post, limiting is the one that does 70% of the work. If you\u2019ve done a good job mixing, mastering should be a piece of cake(in theory, but it is actually more complex than mixing) and if you struggle with it too hard, it\u2019s because your mix is not good enough."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Ali Abouei", "view_list": [16]}, "425": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["Ayush N", "Jake Arnott"], "question_title": "Is it possible to play music from a USB stick in a USB port in a car?", "topic_list": ["USB Ports", "Car Audio", "USB Powered Devices", "Flash Drives", "Universal Serial Bus (USB)", "Computer Hardware", "Computers", "Technology", "Music", "Cars and Automobiles"], "no_of_view": "183", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "ans_list": ["yes u can, thats why its there", "You can in my car (a Nissan Qashqai - but the audio system is German).

So, in modern Western music these days, we have a equal temperament, chromatic scale that consists of 12 intervals (e.g. starting on C and thinking in sharps, not flats): C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, C\nThe reason why there is no half step between E&F or B& C is that the list of intervals above is already in equal steps. So to go from C to C#, you multiply the frequency of C by 1.0595 (approximately, there are many more digits to get it exactly), then to get C# to D, multiply the C# frequency by 1.0595, and so on until you reach C up an octave which is a frequency of twice the lower C.\nSo, the frequency difference of every note in the chromatic in sequential order is 1.0595 that of the next lower note. Thus, the actual frequency difference in percent between E and F is the same as between F and F#, or D# and E.

In music, this scale, along with the chromatic, octatonic, and pentatonic scale, were utilized to mask the idea of a central tonality.

The interval from C to D-natural is a major second for the same reason.\nBut the interval from C to D-flat is considered a \u201cminor\u201d second (even though it\u2019s not part of a C-minor scale) because it has been \u201clowered\u201d by a half-step (in the same way that lowering major thirds and sixths by a half-step will yield their minor equivalents).", "In the real world we have something called gravity. It means that for an ordinary observer standing on the ground there is a clear difference between up and down. Musical space is similarly biased. In the harmonic series, harmonics get closer together as you go up, never the other way around.\nin music theory we say that larger intervals are called major and smaller intervals are called minor. It doesn\u2019t always gaurantee the major interval will sound happier than the minor version, but that is how we name them.\nNow imagine you have two notes an octave apart. Lets say C4 and C5. Now you place a note B in between them but closer to the upper note. To be more specific this new note is a half step (or minor 2nd) below the upper note, and a major 7th above the lower note. It only stands to reason that because the outer distance of an octave is constant, making one of the intervals larger, i.e. major, would make the other interval smaller, i.e. minor.\nThe same is true for other intervals which are inversions of each other such as:\nMajor 2nd vs. Minor 7th\nMinor 3rd vs. Major 6th\nMajor 3rd vs Minor 6th\nThe only time this doesn\u2019t hold true is for perfect 4ths and 5ths. Perfect intervals retain their \u201cperfect\u201d quality when inverted.", "Ok, C to C#/-flat is a minor second. C to B above is a major 7th. If that is inverted it is a leading tone which is a minor second. It all depends on the context.", "There is no minor 2nd. A major 7 is the \u201cleading tone\u201d What you are referring to as the minor 2nd, is actually called the b9 (flat 9). It\u2019s not minor. Minor only implies the minor 3rd."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Voilier Bleu", "view_list": [14, 27, 35, 20, 20]}, "27": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What genre is the music of Rex Orange County?", "topic_list": ["House Music", "Orange County, CA", "Counties", "Southern California", "Country Music", "Genres", "Music Genres", "Music Industry", "Songs", "Music"], "no_of_view": "174", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "C Elizabeth Blocher", "view_list": []}, "816": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "How much money does king rocco take for 1 concert?", "topic_list": ["Concerts", "Musicians", "Music", "Money"], "no_of_view": "168", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Sourabh Jain", "view_list": []}, "192": {"no_of_follower": 2, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "Where can I go to get production for my music?", "topic_list": ["Music Producers", "Music Production", "Music Industry", "Movie Production", "Musicians", "Music"], "no_of_view": "528", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Dionna Antoinette Louis", "view_list": []}, "761": {"no_of_follower": 0, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Anonymous"], "question_title": "Who played Thisbe in the 1964 TV special \"Around the Beatles\"?", "topic_list": ["History of The Beatles", "The Beatles (band)", "Bands (music)", "Entertainment", "Musicians", "Television", "Actors and Actresses", "Television Series", "Music", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "1,025", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["John Lennon played Lady Thisbe as well as playing himself."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Blake Winfield", "view_list": [4]}, "703": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Anonymous"], "question_title": "What was The!

I\u2019m kinda certain that he will give Blackpink a different concept in the comeback. And I can\u2019t wait to check it out. I feel like it may be a slow song but it will still have that Blackpink vibe. I think that the members will get fair line distributions, as all the members got pretty fair line distribution in \u2018\u2019Kick it\u2019\u2019.\nBut, today I\u2019m the person who gets to decide :D\n[math]NAME[/math]\nFor the name, I don't really have any ideas, so if you have one, tell me them in the comments and I\u2019ll give credits! :D\nI feel like Black Swan would be suitable, but I want a \u2018\u2019uniquer\u2019\u2019 (lol is that even a word) name. So yeah I don't have any ideas \ud83d\ude02.\n[math]CONCEPT[/math]\nI really, really want the concept to be creepy in this song. I just feel like Jisoo and Lisa would fit this concept so. freakin. much. I mean- Jisoo has that really creepy stare, while Lisa looks like a doll.\n(BTW: I didn\u2019t say anything about Jennie and Rose because they usually stand out the most in comebacks and I just feel so bad for Lisoo so I\u2019m gonna base this song on them. I have nothing against Rose and Jennie, I don't even have a bias I love all of them the same!)\n[math]MV/MUSIC VIDEO[/math]\nSince it is a creepy song, I would like to give a big twist and a \u2018\u2019hidden\u2019\u2019 meaning behind it. Like \u2018\u2019Russian Roulette\u2019\u2019 by Red Velvet.\nSo its gonna be a bright music video, but not too bright. I want it to look kinda creepy, but also bright.\nSo that's why in the beginning Lisa and Rose will be playing with dolls that look exactly like them in a treehouse in the forest, but the inside of the treehouse would be really bright and pretty, but since I want them to know what the treehouse looks like from the outside and where the treehouse is located, I will start the MV off with a camera going through the woods and flipping to the inside of the treehouse (XD)\n(Kinda like this but it would be night and there would be longer and thicker trees.)\nThe inside would look like this, but half of the side would be green and the other half would be pink. Also, there will be no furniture except for two cushions that Rose and Lisa will be in sitting on whilst playing with the dolls. (Maybe even a small cactus? idk).\nBoth of them will be staring at the camera 5 seconds after the camera flips into the inside of the house (\ud83e\udd23) after that, they will sing their lines, talking about how they have an obsession with dolls. (they\u2019ll talk about how many people think they\u2019re creepy because they have a full house filled with the exact same dolls.)\nThen for the unnie line, they will be in a party (I know, REALLY original) poisoning other peoples drinks. If you watched Jennie\u2019s \u2018\u2019Solo\u2019\u2019 mv, you probably saw her in a party, looking at everyone (kinda) creepily. I want both of them to do that. They will be talking about how they know they\u2019re \u2018\u2019 mental\u2019\u2019 but can't help it. (They won\u2019t say it directly, but the lyrics will give hints) this part would be when the beat kind of drops.\nThey\u2019d be giving these type of stares. Sorry for the low-quality :/ I couldn\u2019t find any pic on google so I had to screenshot it from youtube. Also, I don't know what that weird pink thing is on Jennie\u2019s face.\nInspired by a scene in another Kpop groups mv (Ugh I hate myself I can't remember which K-pop group), the camera will zoom in to Jisoo\u2019s eyes, and then it will zoom out and they\u2019d be in a completely different location.\nAt the candy store.\n(It would look like this but bigger, and there would be a large empty area in the middle where there would be no adults but children (Blackpink is an exception).\nYou might be wondering why? because they will be kidnapping children.\nOk, that sounds too creepy.\nThey will be taking children to their homes by bribing them with candies and dolls. When the children arrive in the \u2018\u2019house\u2019\u2019 (which is basically just a cheap basement with rats running around) they will put capes over the children and poof! they are gone! (No, the capes won't be magical. It\u2019s just that the camera will zoom in to Rose when she sings with her godly vocals) then, THEN ladies and gentlemen, we will finally have Jennie rapping!!\n(If you didn't know Jennie almost never raps even though she is the main rapper. Typical YG)\nShe will blow your minds off with her powerful rap. Then we\u2019ll have Lisa\u2019s rap following after Jennie\u2019s long rap (I will give her a longer rap because she never raps and we want Boombayah, Whistle and DDU DU Jennie back :( )\nThen we will have the best part of the song!! Lisa\u2019s dance break!\nAfter that, Jisoo will soften our hearts with her deep, but soft vocals.\nThe end.\nSo ya that's basically the mv, I didn't add parts like the chorus and stuff cus I'm too lazy to, but they will definitely have those parts :D\n[math]Styling[/math]\nLisa and Rose would be styled as dolls.\nLisa\nLisa would have her signature bangs:\nBut the colour will be blonde.\nShe\u2019ll be wearing bright pink lipstick, blue eyeshadow and a lot of mascara, we need her to look like a doll.\n(Kinda like that)\nShe will be wearing this dress:\nBut without the bag. She will wear this dress in the beginning when she will be playing with dolls in the treehouse along with Rose.\nIn the candy store, she\u2019ll be wearing this dress:\nBut it would be pink and shorter.\nIn the basement, she\u2019ll just be wearing sweatpants and a crop top\nRose\nHer hair colour will be black.\nAnd her makeup will be exactly like the image above.\nShe will be wearing this dress:\nShe will wear this dress in the beginning when she will be playing with dolls in the treehouse along with Lisa.\nIn the candy store, she\u2019ll be wearing this:\nIn the basement, she\u2019ll just be wearing sweatpants and a crop top\nJennie\nShe\u2019ll be wearing this look:\nShe\u2019ll be wearing this dress:\nBut it will be in red. This is the dress she will wear when she is in the party along with Jisoo.\nThis will be what she will wear in the candy store:\nIn the basement, she\u2019ll just be wearing sweatpants and a crop top\nJisoo\nHer makeup will look exactly like this:\nShe\u2019ll be wearing this at the party:\nBut it would be black.\nShe\u2019ll be wearing this at the candy store:\nIn the basement, she\u2019ll just be wearing sweatpants and a crop top\nI would add more outfits, but I\u2019m too lazy soz.\n[math]Outfits[/math]\nThe outfits in the red carpet will be a bit elegant:\nLisa:\nI feel like she gets a lot of boyish dresses, so I\u2019m just gonna turn the tables around.\nJennie:\nShe would really suit this dress.\nRose:\nI know it looks really plain but I feel like she would really suit it.\nJisoo:\nOmg, I found the perfect dress for Jisoo. It would look so pretty on her!\n(Btw, I gave Jennie and Rose short dresses because as I said earlier, I want Lisoo to stand out more in this song.)\n[math]Stage Outfits[/math]\nI\u2019d definitely want to give them comfortable outfits.\nJennie:\nTotally fits her style. Maybe without the sunglasses?\nJisoo:\nOml HOW do I keep on finding perfect dresses for Jisoo jlijksjdhefkkre.\nLisa:\nWe all know that Jennie and Lisa are the \u2018\u2019girl crush\u2019\u2019 members, so they need pants lol. Maybe without shades and bag?\nRose:\nI really liked what outfit I gave her for the red carpet outfit, so I\u2019m gonna stick to something similar as it suits her.\nAaand that was the song! :D\nI hope you liked it! :))))\nBtw.

Briefly, typically one would take every other note, e.g, 1-3-5 this is a triad), where 1, 3, and 5 represent the first, third, and fifth notes of the scale. Seventh chords are similar but extend to the seventh, i.e., 1\u20133\u20135\u20137. Since there are often (but not always) 7 tones in a scale, you can extend these further such as 1\u20133\u20135\u20137\u20139 where the \u201c9\u201d is actually the 2nd note of the scale (\u201c8\u201d is the octave). Common extensions are 9, 11, 13 (but may be \u201caltered\u201d as in b9, #9, b5, #5, #11, etc.)\nSo as an example, the C major scale consisting of C-D-E-F-G-A-B(-C) would yield triads C-E-G (C major), D-F-A (D minor), E-G-B (E minor), F-A-C (F major), G-B-D (G major, A-C-E (A minor), B-D-F (B diminished). Other scales (e.g., C harmonic minor, C melodic minor) will yield different chords. These are diatonic chord as they come from the scale. Note also that the examples are in \u201croot\u201d position. If we \u201cvoiced\u201d the notes of the C major (C-E-G) differently, say E-G-C, it\u2019s still a C major but we would call it an inversion.\nThere are also symmetric chords from scales which have a repeating sequence of intervals such as diminished that yield diminished chords.\nThe notes of a chord can also be \u201ctweaked\u201d which are called alterations.\nNoticed how we took every other note? Those are a \u201cthird\u201d interval between notes. We can takes scales in fourths, fifths, seconds, etc. which work the same way but yield sometimes dramatically different sounds.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with that either.\nI would say you could follow a more traditional electronic music theme, which has a build up, a drop, and a recurring melody. On the other hand you\u2019d be one of many if you do that.\nTo be truly original you\u2019d have to make something that is its own style. But one thing is true for humans: they don\u2019t like repetition in art, that is the downfall of any piece. So e.g. \u201ctwinkle twinkle little star\u201d is one string of a repeated simple tune. It works for little kids, but people who are a little older won\u2019t be playing it all day and still loving it.\nBut don\u2019t take this the wrong way, repetition in art is also essential! If you listen to Bach it is a amazing amalgamation of repetition. However there\u2019s always a little twist: the melody is reverse, enhanced, made longer, shorter, faster, slower, is intertwined with other compositions, etc. That\u2019s what makes it creative.\nSo repetition, yes, but make it sparse, or modify it constantly.

Trust yourself more and don\u2019t overthink things so much.\nBut there\u2019s something deeper here for us to discuss. You are using words like \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cmistakes\u201d to describe your music. Good and bad are 100% subjective and personal, so any opinions using those terms are going to be worthless. I suggest that you NEVER alter your creations based solely on whether one person (or a few people) thinks it\u2019s \u201cgood.\u201d The ONLY question to be answered here is \u201cdoes this music express what is in your heart? Do you have something to say to the world, and does this piece go anywhere toward saying it?\u201d NOTHING else matters.\nAs for \u201cmistakes,\u201d I suggest you learn to embrace your mistakes. In any art form - music, painting, or whatever, your hand will eventually slip and you will play a note you hadn\u2019t intended. You have two choices. You can say \u201cUh-oh, that was WRONG.\u201d Or you can say \u201cHmmm\u2026 I hadn\u2019t thought of playing that note before. I wonder what happens if I play that note, say, three times in a row, followed by a small riff to loop it back into the main idea?\u201d So if you make a \u201cmistake,\u201d you repeat it, or maybe even add a couple more \u201cmistakes.\u201d If it creates a dissonance, you have created a bit of tension in your music. You can relieve this tension by resolving the \u201cwrong\u201d note back to the \u201cright notes\u201d and repeat your main theme. Then when the next verse cycles around, you can repeat this new phrase you just wrote that began as a mistake. This is called improvisation, or more aptly, composing.\nYour subconscious has ideas of its own, and making mistakes is often one way that these ideas get born.

We were fresh with this thought when we walked into the studio 10 minutes later. This was the beginning of the true magic between us. IRONIC - Alanis Morissette & Glen Ballard\nThis was nominated for Grammys in the categories Record of the Year and Best Short Form Music Video.\nIn 1996, this won MTV Video Music Awards for Best Female Video, Best Editing, and Best New Artist In A Video.\nWith Glen Ballard, she wrote 20 songs in 20 session, 12 of which ended up on the album. \"Ironic\"\nSinger/songwriter Alanis Morissette became a runaway success story of the 1990s with her album, Jagged Little Pill. At the end of the song, Alanis says life has a funny funny way of helping us out - in spite of all of the bad stuff that we have to go through. The bad stuff helps us get to where we are going, and that is ironic.\nA former child actress turned dance-pop diva, turned herself into leading vocalist of alternative rock in the late 90s\nAlanis Nadine Morissette was born in Ottawa, Canada, on June 1st 1974. Alanis' Greek name is a feminine version of her father's name,\nAlan. Her mother's name's Georgia and she has two brothers: Chad and Wade (Alanis' Twin). She learned to play the piano at age 6 and the guitar at age 21. In 1986 Alanis made a single called Fate Stay With Me (b-side: Find The Right Man). She recorded two albums as a dance-pop singer in Canada: Alanis (1991) and Now Is The Time (1992). At age 18, she moved to Toronto and worked with several musicians and songwriters, but the collaborations didn't work. In 1994, she finally found the right partner: producer and songwriter Glen Ballard, who had already worked with many artists, including Aretha Franklin Micheal Jackson and Barbara Streisand\nShe moved to LA at age 19. On June 13th 1995 \"Jagged Little Pill\" was released by Maverick Records owned by Madonna . Alanis had found an autobiographical, extremely personal way to write songs. JLP has sold about 30 million copies around the world, turning into the highest selling female album and the 3rd highest selling album of all times.\nAlanis Morissette spent well over a year touring and promoting her 1995 album Jagged Little pill, which burned her out physically and emotionally. For the next year and a half, she took a lot of time off to decompress and re-evaluate. \"Thank U\" is her reaction to the conflicted feelings she had after achieving success.\nDisillusionment, frailty and silence are among the things and feelings Morissette thanks in this song, but at the top of her list is India, where she spent time in 1997. The trip was enlightening and gave her some of the ideas for this song.\nThis was nominated for a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal from the album Supposed Infatuated Junkie , but lost to \"I Will Remember You\" by Sarah Machlain\nAlanis returned with the song Uninvited, for city of Angels (1998) soundtrack on March 31st 1998. In the same year the album \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\" was released. Alanis directed the videos Joining You, Unsent and So Pure from SFIJ. In 1999 she played the role of God in the movie Dogma\n(1999) and collaborated with the song Still for the soundtrack. In 1999 she also recorded the album MTV Unplugged. In 2000 with well known her cover then - King ofPain by sting Alanis performed on Broadway show The Vagina Monologues.\nA Canadian singer who has a powerful singing voice and has written some pretty amazing songs.

Originally The Classical Guitar was strung with gut strings and then by accident The Dupont company discovered nylon and some fisherman started string the guitar with fishing line Thanks to him we have nylon guitar strings. The reason the steel string acoustic was invented was before amplification the nylon string guitar could not be heard when playing with other instruments. With the afvent of Jazz an instrument was needed that could be heard with the other instruments. Although it seems that steel string guitars are more popular than nylon string guitars that is only so in certain parts of the world. In Latin America and Spain nylon strings rule and I. the US and Europe it is steel strings.", "The acoustic is lost to antiquity but it likely wasn\u2019t invented, it likely evolved from other instruments. Even now, there are many types of guitars that vary from what we consider \u2018standard\u2019 - size, number of strings, tuning, all vary throughout the world\nThe electric pickup is generally credited to Adolf Rickenbacker ( of Rickenbacker guitar).. it was installed into a lap steel guitar, nicknamed \u2018the frying pan\u2019.\nI believe that Les Paul iscosidered to be the inventor of the electric guitar, by installing pickups onto what was essentially a board. Nicknamed \u2018the log\u2019, he cut a guitar in half, stuck the log inside, and glued it back together, creating the guitar that would eventually become the ES 335.\nLike Henry Ford and the automobile, Leo Fender did not invent the electric guitar, but he did develop manufacturing techniques that allowed them to be standardized and mass produced.", "Modern classical guitar was invented by Spanish luthier Antonio Torres Jurado in the middle of the 19th century.\nTorres pulled together design elements from other guitars of his era into the design that form the basic one that classical guitarists still use today. So the 650mm scale length (copied by Leo Fender for his Telecaster prototypes), fingerboard width, general body shape, and traditional 7 strut fan internal bracing sytem all come from Torres.\nHere\u2019s classical guitarist Brendan Acker playing a restored 19th century Torres guitar. Not sure you could even tell the difference between it and a contemporary classical just by looking at it:\nAcoustic guitar is a little harder to nail down, but I think Christian Frederick Martin is probably the best contender. Its unclear whether or not he personally invented the X bracing system that supports the top of most contemporary steel string acoustic guitars, but he certainly popularized it and widely expanded its use.", "Double chambered resonator bodies of string instruments came from Central Asia and became sophisticated instruments in Persia. Rajastani pilgrims migrating west passed through Persia on their way to Andalusia and made modifications to the Persian \u201ctar\u201d, a word which means \u201cstrings\u201d or, the instrument with strings, the condition of being with strings. It was called \u201cgitano tar\u201d then that word morphed into guitar. The Persian tar is covered with a membrane made of pericardium (heart sac from sheep, cow) and the migrants modified that by replacing the humidity sensitive membrane with a wood covering that was very thin and supported by bracing. The Persian tar has moveable frets, the guitar has fixed frets which eventually followed the tuning of the 12 semitone equal temperament scale so one can play any chord in any key and still sound more or less (not perfectly) in tune. Metal strings were replaced by gut strings, then nylon. Gut frets were replaced with nylon frets (wrapped around the neck) then metal frets embedded in the neck / fingerboard.

A breathy voice means that your voice is working in a way that is damaging it. When your voice is breathy, you have to increase your air pressure which leads to further damage, creating a cycle.\nThere are many reasons why this can happen. To name a few of them:\n-if you smoke, the membranes of your vocal cords will be damaged and unable to close properly, leading to escape of air.\n-If you are constantly dehydrated. For example, if you don\u2019t drink a lot of water but you drink lots of coffee or alcohol drinks.\n-If you yell a lot your voice gets tired and weak.\n-If you work in a call center and have to be all day talking on the phone.\nIn my experience, this is an issue that can be resolved completely, but it does require mindful practice and in most cases, also some habits have to change.\nGenerally, you have to learn to use your whole instrument properly, but if you want to do something right now, the best thing I can tell you is to check your air support.\nTo make it simple and straight forward: if when you sing you are pulling your belly in, you are not using your air support properly. The air pressure that you send to your vocal cords is going to be too high.\nMake sure that you are breathing properly for singing (using the diaphragm), and that when you sing, you are supporting the air. Letting the diaphragm come to its relaxed position slowly. This will give you a low-pressure airflow and you will be able to control the sound from your vocal cords.\nHOWEVER: have in mind that if you have been a smoker for a while, or if for any reason the membranes of your vocal cords are damaged, it is not going to be a quick fix. It can be restored but you will have to be willing to make some changes.\nIf you are interested, I have just released a free workbook that is designed to help you prepare your body for singing. On it, you can also find a link to a breathing exercise and another for posture. If you want to, go through them and see if you can find where the problem is!!\nAll the best and I sincerely hope you resolve that!\nTune your body to sing"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Ashley Rodriguez", "view_list": [22, 12, 8]}, "537": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 6, "name_list": ["Vivian Liu", "Nerie Lonapse", "Aaron Lo", "Pallavi Naik", "Kara Khampuang", "Irene Kim"], "question_title": "Why is Kpop adored by many who don\u2019t speak Korean?

That means there is less of an issue with the frequencies where you usually expect a crossover dip, especially for vocals. But the tweeters also go up to 40kHz, way above what you need, which means you never run into the limitations of the tweeter ever.\nThey are driven by a 100W amp for the tweeter and 150W amp for the woofer (both AB class specially designed for this speaker) and deliver 109dB SPL, plenty for any room these are designed for.\nThe guy who sold them to me told me he prefers them to the Twins as he says they sound cleaner.

The different contexts of the two songs make the meaning of those words totally different. John replied to Paul, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a tribute.\u201d John lost that lawsuit and, as I recall, covered a couple of Chuck\u2019s songs as payment. The owners of those songs then received royalties when Lennon\u2019s albums were purchased. All in all, it wasn\u2019t too painful for Lennon, but he could have avoided the entire thing by changing those words just a bit\u2026 \u201cThere goes a flat top.\u201d would have probably passed by without any issues.

Since Antonio Stradivari\u2019s time, many, many, many violin makers have made violins using Stradivari\u2019s designs and specifications to some extent and have labeled them as Strad copies. Some of these are exact replicas of famous Stradivarius instruments, meticulously handcrafted by master luthiers, worth tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, that any professional violinist would be proud to play. Many others were made by lesser craftsmen, good violins worth a few thousand or so. A lot more \u2014 maybe the majority? \u2014 are mass-produced, factory-made student grade instruments, some of which are decent playing and sounding instruments perfectly suited for a beginner, worth a few hundred dollars or so, and some of which are cheap, shoddily made, unplayable violin-shaped objects that are sold exclusively online (because no reputable violin shop will sell them).\nSo simply knowing that a violin is a Strad copy tells you nothing about its maker, age, quality, condition, or sale price. Those are what you need to consider when purchasing a violin.\nGo (in-person if at all possible) to a brick-n-mortar violin shop. Do not go to Guitar Center or Sam Ash or your local guitars-drums-keyboards music store; they won\u2019t have violins and even if they have one or two, they will be cheap crap and the sales people won\u2019t know anything about them anyway. You need a store that specializes in violins and bowed string instruments. Talk to the sales people, let them know how much you\u2019re able to spend (don\u2019t forget \u2014 you need a bow and a case in addition to the violin!) and let them recommend some instruments for you to try out and listen to.

The differences between loud and soft, solo and ensemble (as in the concerto), different instruments and timbres all play an important role in many Baroque compositions. Composers also began to be more precise about instrumentation, often specifying the instruments on which a piece should be played instead of allowing the performer to choose. Brilliant instruments like the trumpet and violin also grew in popularity.\nMonody and the advent of the basso continuo\nIn previous musical eras, a piece of music tended to consist of a single melody, perhaps with an improvised accompaniment, or several melodies played simultaneously. Not until the Baroque period did the concept of \u201cmelody\u201d and \u201charmony\u201d truly begin to be articulated. As part of the effort to imitate ancient music, composers started focusing less on the complicated polyphony that dominated the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and more on a single voice with a simplified accompaniment, or monody. If music was a form of rhetoric, as the writings of the Greeks and Romans indicate, a powerful orator is necessary\u2014and who better for the job than a vocal soloist? The new merger between the expression of feeling and the solo singer come through loud and clear in Monteverdi\u2019s preface to the Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda from his Eighth Book of Madrigals (1638), in which he writes: \u201cIt has seemed to me that the chief passions or affections of our mind are three in number, namely anger, equanimity and humility. The best philosophers agree, and the very nature of our voice, with its high, low and middle ranges, would indicate as much.\u201d The earliest operas are an excellent illustration of this new aesthetic.\nAlong with the emphasis on a single melody and bass line came the practice of basso continuo, a method of musical notation in which the melody and bass line are written out and the harmonic filler indicated in a type of shorthand. As the Italian musician Agostino Agazzari explained in 1607:\nSince the true style of expressing the words has at last been found, namely, by reproducing their sense in the best manner possible, which succeeds best with a single voice (or no more than a few), as in the modern airs by various able men, and as is the constant practice at Rome in concerted music, I say that it is not necessary to make a score\u2026 A Bass, with its signs for the harmonies, is enough. But if some one were to tell me that, for playing the old works, full of fugue and counterpoints, a Bass is not enough, my answer is that vocal works of this kind are no longer in use.\nBecause basso continuo, or thorough bass, remained standard practice until the end of the Baroque period, the era is sometimes known as the \u201cage of the thorough bass.\u201d\nDifferent instrumental sounds\nAfter being ignored for decades, Baroque music has become increasingly popular over the last fifty years. As part of this new interest, scholars and musicians have spent countless hours trying to figure out how the music might have sounded to 17th and 18th century audiences. While we will never be able to recreate a performance precisely, their work has unearthed several major differences between Baroque and modern ensembles:\npitch: In 1939, modern orchestras agreed to tune to a\u2019=440hz (the note A pitched at 440 cycles per second), which replaced a previously lower pitch (a\u2019=435hz) adopted in 1859. Before 1859, however, there was no pitch standard. The note to which Baroque ensembles tuned, therefore, varied widely at different times and in different places. As a result, the music notated on a score might have sounded as much as a half tone lower than how it would traditionally be performed today. In an effort to allow for this discrepancy, many baroque ensembles adjust their tuning to the repertoire being performed: a\u2019= 415hz for late baroque music, a\u2019=392hz for French music, a\u2019=440hz for early Italian music and a\u2019=430hz for classical repertoire.\ntimbre: While most of the instruments in a baroque ensemble are familiar, there are several prominent members no longer featured in modern ensembles. The harpsichord was the primary keyboard instrument (and an important member of the continuo group), and instruments important in the 16th and 17th centuries like the lute and viol, still continued to be used. Variations in instruments still popular today also gave the baroque ensemble a different sound. String instruments like the violin, viola and cello used gut strings rather than the strings wrapped in metal with which they are strung today, for example, giving them a mellower, sweeter tone.\nperformance technique: A baroque score contains little (if any) information about elements like articulation, ornamentation or dynamics, and so modern ensembles need to make their own informed choices before each performance. Mechanical differences between baroque and modern instruments also suggest that the older instruments would have sounded differently, so ensembles like Music of the Baroque often adjust their technique to allow for this. Because baroque and modern bows are structurally different, for example, string players using modern bows often use a gentler attack on the string and crescendos and diminuendos on longer notes. 17th and 18th century performance treatises also imply that finger vibrato (a technique in which a string player rocks his or her fingertip on the string to enrich the tone) was used sparingly for expressive moments, while bow vibrato (an undulating movement of the bow) was generally preferred."], "date_list": ["Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Bhavin Patel", "view_list": [188]}, "1006": {"no_of_follower": 3, "respond_collected": 4, "name_list": ["Arielle Lim", "Dannika Esquibel", "Neneh Duanda", "Irene Kim"], "question_title": "Why many KPOP artists' MV are posted on Stone Music Entertainment or 1THEK YouTube channel?

And because Ringo wasn\u2019t a real song writer like himself and Paul. George Harrison actually helped Ringo finish some of Ringo\u2019s songs. They all worked together with only perhaps a dozen or so songs that one or more did not like or want to do. Paul and John wrote songs for George once, and for Ringo often, one song per album, so each Beatle had a shot at singing the lead on a song. After all they got by with a little help from their friends!\nJohn mostly said he would not be able to write some of Paul\u2019s songs. Paul wrote more positive extrovert songs with characters, like Eleanor Rigby and Lovely Rita. John became more of a self absorbed song writer, starting with Help, In My LIfe, and even Mr Kite (about a poster he bought) and Lucy in the skies (inspired by his son\u2019s drawing for school). Even his marriage in the Ballad of John and Yoko and references to his drug use and abuse became part of his musical topics.\nWith the competitive genius of the two main songwriters, and their styles becoming distinctive to each, criticisms began to arise. Paul was not a fan of a few of John\u2019s songs but he respected his partner enough to never discuss the matter in public. We know for example that Paul and George chose to not record Cold Turkey, likely for it\u2019s drug focus not being an image they wanted for the Beatles. But they did not make it public. John complained about it later.\nJohn had a bit of a cruel edge to him. He even wrote about hitting a woman in a song. John was willing to let his edge out on occasion. And as he grew distant from Paul, Paul became a target. The breakup made that worse as while John left the Beatles, Paul got the credit for it, and that did not please John at all. Which led to John (and George) making the song How do you Sleep.\nPaul writing a song hinting at peace between them helped mend their parting and they rebuilt their former friendship until John was taken from the world by a bullet from a madman.\n(I told you it was complicated!)\nGive Peace a Chance!", "He probably didn\u2019t consider Ringo his equal as far as abilities of songwriting.
