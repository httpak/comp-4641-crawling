He retired in 77 took 10 years off, and with Ali\u2019s encouragement came back in 87. He looked out of shape and old, but he still had tremendous power, and guts. He gave a prime Holyfield all he could handle in losing a decision. At 45 he beat Moorer for the title. I never gave him a chance in his comeback, now when I watch his second incarnation as this jolly old fat guy, I\u2019m amazed. He is living proof that the last thing a fighter loses is his punch. When he was young and meteoric, he always looked angry. When he came back he was funny and lovable. Everyone cheered. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever see the likes of him again.

So the huge and fat old champ knew how to make money! Boxing! I have to admit I was extremely skeptical of George\u2019s comeback.

He had greater self- control and paced himself well during the course of his many later fights. This was certainly not the case in his first incarnation. Finally he fought well against young lions and regained the world heavyweight championship in his mid-forties. He did more than improve his legacy. He became something of a legend.", "It obviously helped it. I mean, the guy was at or near the top of the heavyweight contenders for several years after his return, won back the lineal heavyweight title at the age of 44, went the distance with Evander Holyfield at the peak of his powers, and completely changed his image from the brooding bad guy of the his 1970s peak to a folk hero in the 1990s.\nHe was in no way better in his comeback than he had been before, but he always had tremendous boxing skills. If he had a problem in the 1970s, it was that sometimes he got away from that and let his opponent dictate the fight to him, like he did against both Ali and Jimmy Young in the two fights he lost. As others have said, when Ali started that rope-a-dope stuff, Foreman\u2019s trainer should have told him to go to the middle of ring and tell Muhammad, \u201cif you want the belt, you come and get it.\u201d\nI once saw an interview with Foreman where he said he wasn\u2019t a smart fighter in his prime, and when he came back, he was, but by that time his physical gifts were long gone, and he had to win on his skill and toughness.\nBut even taking the second half of his career on its own merits, without considering what he did prior to 1987, Foreman would have been a worthy champion. He got a few extra opportunities due to his popularity, but he earned that popularity. Plenty of guys have done that. Mike Tyson didn\u2019t deserve a title shot after he got out of jail based on beating Peter McNeeley and Buster Mathis Jr., and he didn\u2019t really earn his title shot against Lennox Lewis, either. Evander Holyfield got several shots he didn\u2019t earn late in his career. So why not Big George?", "of course it helped immensely", "It improved it exponentially. In his first career he was most famous for losing to Muhammad Ali. In his 2nd career he won the title again 20 years after he first won it-and re-invented himself from a surly young man into a lovable grandpa that everyone wanted to buy grills from. He was even a pitchman for Meineke Muffler for a while. And giving 29 year old champion Evander Holyfield a helluva fight in 1991 at age 42, and KO-ing Michael Moorer-who had taken Holyfield\u2019s title-at age 45 cemented his reputation of invincibility. He was beating champions 15 years younger than him-that were in junior high when he fought Ali.", "Helped.

If anything, ESPN and the conference networks like Big Ten and Longhorn have shown more older football games then ever (and likely have better ratings than a live softball game).

Sure, they get paid many millions of dollars to do this, but what they are paid in salaries is less than half of the revenue collected by the leagues.\nNo players means no games, so shouldn\u2019t they be paid according to the revenue that the league collects? People complain about this all the time, but the NFL is a big business and its players get over 45% of the league revenue. This criticism often comes from people in other countries - like, say, Australia, where the much poorer leagues of Australian Rules Football pay their own players something like only 30% of revenue.\nIt is the owners - the billionaires - who are making money from corporate welfare. You can make the argument that the league could simply fold and the players would be completely out of a job, but time has proven that this is a mutual relationship. Players are necessary for the game, and when the best players aren\u2019t on the field, fewer people will watch. Leagues can and do try to reduce player salaries, but when the league teams are independent and legally subject to anti-trust laws, they can\u2019t dictate terms to players as they have in the past.\nOne thing you should look at is the average length of career, and how many players are making closer to the league minimum, rather those star players who are making tens of millions per season.

Instead of even one more penny going to a sports group of any kind, better preparation and financial reservoir for emergency situations and medical care should be prioritized.\nIn fact, spectator sports and stadiums may be the most useless blots on the scenery for the next thousand years; it was about that length of time between building these behemoths already. Plagues and pandemics played a role in that.", "Why shouldn't the owners who benefit pay for the stadiums?\nAthletes play a few years and then are gone, why should they or you taxpayers pay?", "Kind of like corporate welfare, isn\u2019t it? But you may not be looking at it from both sides.\nSome of these taxpayers you\u2019re talking about earn their income from those very stadiums and arenas. As a sad example, take a look at AOC not wanting to grant Amazon a tax break. Who is really the loser in that? Is it Amazon or is it all prospective employees and outside vendors, hotel and restaurant businesses and their employees, etc.? Or is it property owners who watch that decision adversely affect the value of their real estate?\nThese stadiums an arenas are huge to your local and state residents. It\u2019s trickle down in the most obvious and effective way. You must consider all jobs directly created and those collaterally supported by these stadiums and arenas and the beneficial effect they have in their community and state.\nI would like to say, and I mean just a little disrespect, but it\u2019s almost funny how people question the use of their taxpayer money that results in a benefit to everyone, everywhere, yet, these same taxpayers accept without complaint, the useless programs that their money is spent on that actually ruin their economy and the individual. It\u2019s a joke and a bad one at that.\nSuffice to say, IMHO, you invest in your community and state much to their benefit when you use your money to build anything that creates and supports jobs, adds pride to the community and houses great and wholesome entertainment for the whole family.", "Most stadiums are municipally owned and are usually used for several sports and other types of entertainment. Some cities have recently taken a hard stand and forced private team owners to pay for stadiums, like the new Rams/Chargers stadium in Inglewood. Staples Center in downtown LA is another example, owned not by the teams but by Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) which does not own a team that plays in Staples but does own professional teams in Denver and elsewhere. Staples is used by two pro basketball teams, one hockey team and is used for college tournaments. It is used on non sporting nights for some type of entertainment throughout the year. There is no push to have players somehow subsidize stadiums, that is the responsibility of owners and local governments.", "I don\u2019t know about fair or not fair. Having a Sports Stadium nearby helps the local economy by bringing all kinds of business to the area. When a team is looking to build a new stadium local governments from all over ask them to build in their town. Since multiple places are trying to get the stadium built in their town it creates a competition where the sports team gets to ask the potential cities for incentives. The city that offers the best incentives gets the stadium built in their town.\nSometimes the economic benefits of the increased business pays the city back in revenue more then what it had to pay to convince the team to build quickly and sometimes in increased revenue never quick comes as promised.\nSo the reason is because the elected officials (people your community elected because it believes in their judgement) believed it would have an overall positive impact on the community and would be worth the cost.", "How about we just refuse to pay for new professional sports venues? Citizens unite and tell your local politicians that you think the owners who will reap the benefits should pay for their own stadiums out of their $Billions. Ridiculous to be bullied. If all tax payers refused to authorize the spending, the owners wouldn\u2019t be able to play one city against another with threats of moving their teams.", "Since the athletes don\u2019t get a stake in the stadiums, it\u2019s not clear why they should pay for them.

Nomar, and my neighbor`s infatuation with him, is what got me into baseball and the Red Sox at first; seeing him play was simply insane, I wish I knew more about baseball when he was on the team. Looking back now, I realize Garciaparra was actually probably one of the best right-handed hitters for the Sox ever, before injuries kind of derailed his career. I`ll always associate the team with him, no matter how long he`s been retired.\nMy current favorite player is the current shorstop, Xander Bogaerts. I always knew he was going to break out and become a star, and as of 2018, he has. With Mookie Betts gone, he is probably the new offensive leader of the team. He may not hit quite as many home runs as J.D Martinez, and maybe his average is sometimes lower (although it wasn`t last year, I don`t think), but Xander is such a complete player I never want him to leave the Sox. He`s got enough power to be considered dangerous (anywhere from 20\u201335 HR in a season), enough speed to steal bases, a good enough swing to hit for extra base hits and average, and he`s really come into his own on defense. As long as Xander is on the team, I feel good about the Red Sox offense.", "I am a Yankee fan so I did not like to many Red Sox players.

So in 2004, when they were mounting their comeback against the Yankees, I was glued to the tiny TV in my bedroom, long after the rest of the house went to sleep, watching in amazement as the Red Sox clawed their way back. No discussion of that series would be possible without the man who had the walk-off RBI in win-or-go-home games 4 and 5, David Ortiz. Yes, they got heroics from Dave Roberts\u2019 steal, Schilling and his literal blood red sock, and Johnny Damon\u2019s game 7 grand slam.

They keep trading serves until one player wins 2 games in a row from a tie score (e.g., 10\u20138). It makes most sense to uphold this tradition at the French because players often get more chances to break serve on this slower clay surface.\nThe US Open is on the opposite end of the spectrum. For a very long time, the US Open has always mandated a 7-pt tiebreaker at the end of any 6\u20136 set. The tiebreaker is an American invention and first adopted in American tournaments so this is also appropriate.\nJust this year, the Australian Open has mandated a 10-point tiebreaker at the end of a tied final set. Personally for me this is better than a 7 point tiebreaker because it's less likely the breaker will be determined by one or two shots.\nFinally, Wimbledon has reluctantly bowed to popular demand and have instituted a 7 pt tiebreaker if the score becomes knotted at 12\u201312 in the final set. In other words, at 6\u20136 players play as normal but there is a limit to how long taking turns serving complete games will go. The match will end with a tiebreaker at 12-all. That is the absolute farthest the match can go.\nSo, the maximum number of games breaks down as follows,\nThe US Open and AO, 13 games maximum (7\u20136)\nWimbledon, 25 games max (13\u201312)\nAnd the French Open: Infinite"], "topic_list": ["Tennis Players", "Tennis", "Sports", "Games"], "view_list": [52], "create_time": "Apr 21, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Catherine Doucer", "upvote_list": [3], "question_title": "How many games are in a 5th set in tennis?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "491", "name_list": ["Matt McGee"], "date_list": ["Apr 23, 2020"]}, "392": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Wrestling (sport)", "Defecation", "Feces", "Sports", "Life Advice"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 22, 2020", "no_of_follower": 0, "question_author": "Anonymous", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "How do I keep from getting poop on my wrestling singlet?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "232", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "1242": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["error"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "", "no_of_follower": 0, "question_author": "", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "error", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": 0, "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "435": {"ans_list": ["Gravity causes you to accelerate downwards at 9.8m/s\u00b2\nThat means if you're moving up with a velocity of 9.8m/s, then you'll lose that velocity in one second.

So we can just compare his first 9 seasons to Trout\u2019s as a starting point. Note that this covers ages 21\u201329 for Bonds, and 19\u201327 for Trout.\nBonds has quite respectable numbers over that period. 276 doubles, 41 triples, and 259 HR with 309 steals and 39 SB. There are 13 players who have topped those doubles/HR/steals numbers in their careers. All of them except Carlos Beltran, Bobby Bonds, and Steve Finley are in the Hall of Fame. If you loosen it to 250 HR and 300 SB in the first ten years, the list drops to two: Barry and Bobby Bonds (265/364).\nBonds put up 66.4 WAR in his first 9 seasons. That\u2019s really good. #6 all time, in fact. The names on the list ahead of him are Ted Williams (despite missing 3 seasons to the war!), Albert Pujols, Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle, and\u2026.Mike Trout.\nTrout is #3, otherwise the list is in the order I gave above. Williams 75.4, Pujols 73.8, Trout 72.8, Mays 68.1, Mantle 67.9, Bonds 66.4. That\u2019s not a huge margin; it\u2019s about 3/4 of a win per season.\nBut then you have to look back at age: Bonds is two years older. If you look at them both through their age-27 seasons, Bonds drops to 50.3.\nSo yes, Trout has been significantly better than Bonds to this point in their careers.\nBTW, Trout is at 251 doubles, 46 triples, 285 HR and 200 steals. If you plug those 2B/HR/SB totals in, it\u2019s not as exclusive as the Bonds group. There are 29 players who have exceeded those for a career. But limit it to first 9 seasons, and\u2026it\u2019s just Trout.\nYeah, those are kind of gimmicky things to look at, but it\u2019s a sign of how unique a talent Trout is. Even if you take the doubles out of the equation, he\u2019s still alone. To put anybody else on the list you either have to take the SB down to 160 (Alex Rodriguez) or the HR down to 176 (Barry Bonds).\nThe one thing Bonds does have over trout to this point in their careers is defensive value. Through age 27, Bonds has 11.2 dWAR, Trout only 3.4.", "First, i\u2019d like to point out that Bonds was not accused of taking PEDs until well into his 30s, Trout is only 27, so the \u201cpre-PED\u201d comment is not relevant for the general question being sought here.\nRephrasing: Who was better through their age 27 season, Trout or Bonds?\nAnswer has to be Trout. At the age of 20, Trout posted a 10-win season in the majors. At the age of 20, Bonds was still in his junior year at Arizona State; he wouldn\u2019t debut until age 21.\nBonds didn\u2019t really mature into the superstar he became until the age of 25 (his first MVP season). Through Trout\u2019s age 25 season, he had two MVPs, two 2nd place MVP finishes (both of which a lot of people would argue he should have won).\nsee\nMike Trout Stats | Baseball-Reference.com\nand\nBarry Bonds Stats | Baseball-Reference.com"], "topic_list": ["Barry Bonds (baseball player)", "Mike Trout (baseball player)", "Baseball Players", "Baseball Statistics", "MLB Players", "Major League Baseball", "Baseball", "Sports"], "view_list": [242, 57], "create_time": "Apr 30, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Bevan Narinesingh", "upvote_list": [4, 0], "question_title": "Was a pre-PED Barry Bonds a better player than Mike Trout at a similar career juncture?", "respond_collected": 2, "no_of_view": "499", "name_list": ["Mike Jones", "Todd Boss"], "date_list": ["May 1, 2020", "Apr 30, 2020"]}, "1398": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["error"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "", "no_of_follower": 0, "question_author": "", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "error", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": 0, "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "733": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Hand to Hand Combat", "Kickboxing", "Muay Thai", "Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)", "Boxing (sport)", "Mixed Martial Arts", "Martial Arts", "Fighting", "Sports"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Anonymous", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "How does One Championship\u2019s kickboxing division compare to Glory Kickboxing?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "207", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "239": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Professional Sports", "Sports"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 25, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Efrayim Bulka", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "What sports did Alex Morgan play as a kid?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "258", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "980": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["error"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "", "no_of_follower": 0, "question_author": "", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "error", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": 0, "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "1376": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["error"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "", "no_of_follower": 0, "question_author": "", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "error", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": 0, "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "675": {"ans_list": ["Yes.

That fact alone does it for me, but we\u2019ll agree to disagree. Foreman was a clumsy oaf pretty much devoid of boxing skill just very heavy handed, none of the skill/speed/accuracy of Tyson. Mike may not have had the warriors spirit in him I\u2019ll grant you that, but he did get up against Lewis but was stopped on his feet, he did get up against Buster Douglas but was stopped on his feet he wasn\u2019t a complete melt. If you\u2019re good enough you can make your opponents look like \u2018tomato cans\u2019 and Tyson\u2019s bad losses came in the 2000\u2019s when he was clearly completely washed up and just fighting in order to pay the tax man (same as Holmes was when he fought Tyson). We are talking prime 86\u201389 Tyson who rightfully instilled fear in his opponents. If you want to be picky, Tyson never got dropped heavily by a guy weighing 13 stone and nearly beaten and needed his corner to cheat with the glove tear, that Angelo Dundee has freely admitted to. I\u2019m talking Cooper, if he didn\u2019t have weak eye skin that tore just to look at it, he had Ali in serious trouble in their first meeting. Tyson didn\u2019t get his jaw broke twice because he was trying to be flash by pulling his head back from a shot rather than slipping or blocking it and got chinned good and proper in an amateurish way on a number of occasions. I know the story but it proves he\u2019s not as elusive as he was made out to be. It\u2019s easy to make a legend if you \u2018highlight\u2019 their career. Tyson makes the highlight reel regularly, Ali does not and he fought plenty of mugs in his time too. Says enough for me.

Hope this helps.", "As far as hand speed is concerned, prime Ali had the fastest hands of any HW ever. This is actually a scientific fact whereby his handspeed had been clocked & documented as the fastest. Probably the fastest HW punch ever thrown was the \u201cphantom\u201d punch which Ali \u201cdropped\u201d Liston with in their rematch way back in \u201865. Ali himself called this weak looking punch his \u201canchor\u201d punch but it was delivered like a bolt of lightning & was comfortably faster than the blink of an eye.\nIn terms of handspeed, the Iron Man was also a speed demon but he generally gets rated as the 3rd fastest HW in history- Floyd Patterson being the 2nd fastest. So Ali has a slight edge in terms of handspeed.\nIn terms of foot speed, I think it is almost too close to call. Tyson generally gets rated as the no.1 gap closer of the modern HW era & in this respect , I think he is in a league of his own. Ali\u2019s best footwork was more often than not defensive footwork & was designed primarily to keep him out of harms way. So it is a difficult & somewhat unfair comparison - Tyson\u2019s aggressive footwork vs Ali\u2019s defensive footwork\u2026\u2026.Certainly the most spectacular display of footwork ever was the Ali shuffle, particularly in his finest hour vs Cleveland \u201cBig Cat\u201d Williams.\nIn this fight, Ali was believed to be almost untouchable & his footwork was dazzling to say the least.\nWatching prime Tyson jump rope was also an awe inspiring sight. 16 stone guys don\u2019t usually defy the law of gravity so easily. A well known American boxing writer once described prime Tyson as the boxing equivalent of Baryshnikov. In terms of P4P foot speed, I think it\u2019s dead even, given that Tyson was the more muscular & heavier guy.", "From a functional stand point. Ali did.\nTyson was explosive and put more of his body into his punches, Ali was fluid and efficient.\nBeing explosive however, is a give away in boxing, the best guys will see the punches coming or brace for them at least. Smooth punches don't allow your oponents to react as easy, since there isn't as much tell. This is why Ali was hitting oponents so easy, especially in his prime, but in truth his entire career. He was beating high level boxers in the 70s and really wasn't athletically all there.", "I would say Ali (when he was actually Clay), but Tyson is a lot closer in hand speed than people would give him credit for.\nBoth had great footwork, but in different ways. (I don\u2019t even know if \u201cspeed\u201d is a thing when it comes to footwork.) Boxing is a lot like playing the drums or the piano. What you are doing with your hands has to work independently of what you are doing with your feet. You can concentrate on what your hands are doing, but your footwork needs to be automatic. If you have to think about it, you\u2019ll probably get hit.\nA lot of fighters, even successful ones, never develop their footwork. This was exploited by both Ali and Tyson. You could see it every time Ali would change direction and his opponent would look like an idiot. Tyson was a master of cutting off the ring and stepping inside on guys. He would do those little dips with his shoulders to avoid a punch, but whenever he did that he would take a step forward. He really knew how to make a guy pay for it when he missed.\nLarry Holmes had a great move where he would lean back on the ropes to avoid a punch, then step to the right and throw his right hand. He had great feet as well.\nActually, one of the things that used to drive me crazy were guys who always seemed to end the round in their corner. I never figured it out. There was a guy I fought a few times and I swear every time a round ended, he would stand there and look at me for a minute and then take a seat, while I had to walk across the ring to my corner. Ali was really good at that. I still don\u2019t know how the hell someone can have that kind of awareness, but that may also have been something they did intentionally when they sparred.\nThe guy with the greatest footwork ever was Ray Robinson. But he was the closest thing we ever had to a perfect fighter. Ali patterned his entire career after him.", "I\u2019ve been around a while. I have seen every fight from the Olympics forward for Ali/Clay and I have watched all of Tyson\u2019s professional bouts. In my opinion, there is nothing to debate. Not only was Ali much faster than anyone, past or future, in his prime, no one could have laid a glove on him. In his prime, 1964-67, he was, far and away, the best boxer ever.", "Soo\u2026 who\u2019s the fastest well, I couldn\u2019t find much on how quick Tyson could hit but I could in Ali.\nAli\u2019s jab was measured on a omegascope, it was found that his jab could smash a balsa board 16.5 inches away in 19/100 of a second. His jab actully covered the distance on 4/100 of a second which is a blink of an eye.\nPrime Ali was just to quick it was like watching an old Bruce lee movie where the cameras weren\u2019t quick enough to see his punches.\nTyson was fast don\u2019t get me wrong but Ali was quicker.\nTyson\u2019s punches though where just perfection to watch he practiced combs in the mirror when he was younger. Eveything was right he generated perfect and maximum power with each punch. All throughout his body he would get maximum power for full force punching.\nAnd for the foot speed just got watch the great man \u201cfloat like a butterfly\u201d\nAmazing art work.\nTo much class in a photo.\nThe Greatest and iron Mike Tyson.", "Great question! My opinion is this; Tyson used his foot speed to cutoff the ring, to augment his offense. Ali used his feet to escape his opponent's offense. While Ali\u2019s movement was more aesthetically pleasing, it wasnt any more effective than Tysons footwork. I have to call a draw on this one. Truth is, prime vs prime would be a fight for the ages.

With a recurve you are holding the max draw weight at full draw and most all people are not at their strongest in that position.", "Your maximum draw weight is determined by a combination of size, strength, technique, and bow design. Your size determines how much strength you have to work with, and your technique how much of that strength you can actually apply to drawing the bow. Some bows are harder to draw than others.\nMark Stretton holds the modern world record for drawing a heavy 200 pound war bow. He\u2019s not a small man, but there are bigger and stronger men who could not draw that bow.\nJoe Gibbs has the record for shooting a heavy war arrow the farthest, over 300 yd. He shoots heavy 170 pound longbows and recurves. There are smaller and bigger men who can lift more weight, but can\u2019t draw the bows he can.\nKhatuna Lorig is an Olympic target archery champion. She uses a 52 pound bow for target archery, a weight heavier than some bigger, stronger men use for target shooting or hunting.\nBow design makes some bows easier or harder to draw at the same weight. Some bows will cast the same arrows faster and/or farther at lower draw weights than heavier bows. Shorter bows have a sharper string angle that can pinch the fingers together more as you near the end of the draw stroke. Drawing with the thumb can eliminate that problem. How the draw weight builds during the draw stroke can make a heavier bow seem lighter, or a lighter bow heavier. A bow with a steady, even draw force curve can feel easier than a bow that \u201cstacks\u201d the weight in the middle or at the end. Modern compound bows with pulleys and cams build to a peak, then drop off so you are holding less weight at full draw. It might take 70 pounds to draw the bow, but only 15 pounds to hold it at full draw. An 82 pound Manchu bow builds more weight in the middle of the draw stroke but does not drop off. It can feel heavier to draw than a 100 pound longbow, but cast the same arrow faster than a 125 pound longbow.\nRecurves cast arrows faster and farther than longbows of the same draw weight.

For example, I have a samick sage recurve bow with 35# limbs. These limbs have a maximum safe draw distance of 36 inch. Meaning that it will take 35# of force to draw it back 36 inchs. Can you pull it further back, yes. It is not safe to do so because the limbs of the bow can only take so much but yes. The more you pull the bowstring back the more force it will have.\nFor compound bows: No, a compound bows draw weight is determined by how the mechanics of the bow it set. Without changing the settings there is nothing you can do you increase the draw weight.", "How much you can draw matters but how much are you comfortable holding back in an odd position?

Learn how to put your back muscles into it, and your max pull is going to go up substantially. Figure out how to incorporate opposing force with your bracing arm and you\u2019ll up your poundage further still.\nI\u2019m a fairly strong bloke, but when I first start shooting, a 35# recurve would wear me out after three or four ends.

I experimented with the 40 yard dash by trying three different starting positions. Btw, my right foot/leg is my dominant so I always push off with it.\nAnyways, my experiment was starting with both hands on the ground, starting with one hand on the ground and starting in the upright position with no hands on the ground.

Both feet do not leave the starting block at the same instant. Your back foot gives you the real push the block provide.

On the right, signed by Robert D. Manfred (Jr.) as commissioner, is a 2019 ball.\nOne can feel a difference between the two, primarily in terms of hardness. The 2019 is incredibly hard, with as much give as a solid granite stone. An even better illustration is the 2017, 2018, and 2019 balls are compared:\nThey\u2019re labeled as \u201cSpring Training\u201d balls, but this signifies to us (as umpires and staff) that they are for use for Major League and AAA pitchers within the spring training time period of that year. AA and A league players use a different ball (pictured below), while international league players (such as Korean Professional, Mexican Professional, or Japanese Professional) will bring and use their own ball. I\u2019ve called games wherein, at any one time, I\u2019ve got one of four different baseballs in my ball bags.\nHere\u2019s a better, closer view of the three latest Major League baseballs (I didn\u2019t get a 2020 ball, because, obviously, COVID-19 stamped out the season):\nLook, specifically, at the seams. The threads on the 2019 ball are finer, and the gap in the seam is much tighter. Why\u2019s that? Because between the 2018 and 2019 seasons, Rawlings (which is 50% owned by MLB) undertook a substantial quality controls campaign in the production of Major League baseballs. The rubber-clad cork pills (the center core) was made more precisely, the winding of the yarn was done, robotically, more precisely, and the leather casing pieces were precision cut by a laser. The stitch holes were also \u201cshot\u201d more precisely by a laser-guided machine. As such, the entire ball was made \u201ctighter\u201d. To whit, this tighter ball brings with it a degree of fragility. The entire ball is so tight the seams look like they\u2019re under enormous tension, and are on the verge of splitting.\nThis fragility isn\u2019t a problem when the average lifespan of a Major League baseball in a game is less than five pitches. However, these baseballs, once removed or rejected from a game, are not to be used for a game again, and are actually too hard, too slick, and too tight to be used in pitching machines for batting practice. They can be used as Live batting practice balls, and while some do end up being acquired by amateur organizations, I can speak from experience, they don\u2019t hold up as well as their Minor League or lesser-league siblings:\nIn the upper left is that same 2019 Major League baseball. In the upper right is the \u201cGeneric\u201d Minor League Baseball (this one is not labeled with the specific minor league, thus, any AA or A club may use it). In the lower left is the Arizona Fall League (Rookie League) baseball. In the lower right is the \u201cRawlings Official League Baseball\u201d (which was asked about in the OQ). This particular one is labeled for use by the Dutch professional league (KBBSF\u2022FRBBS). Note how much thicker and more robust the seams are both the AZFL and ROLB baseballs. These baseballs are similar to the specification used for High School (NFHS) baseballs. Each conference in NCAA & NAIA baseball is allowed to designate their own baseball, too, but nearly all are using the same specification found in the Minor League baseball. It really is easier on a pitcher to pitch than its Major League sibling, and tends to hold up over multiple pitches, hits and impacts better. One of our NAIA conferences here uses this type of baseball, and provided the players & staff-members retrieve the foul balls, we use no more than 12\u201316 of them per 9-inning game.\nMost of our Adult Amateur leagues use the same spec as the Minor League ball. Some of the local (to Phoenix, AZ) leagues even go so far as to obtain \u201cused\u201d baseballs from the fifteen clubs that call Phoenix home, and I can tell you, hand on heart, the Minor League balls last longer than the Major League ones, besides the pitchers find the Major League ones too hard, and the seams too low, to get good bite on curves and sliders on.\n\u201cWhat is the best ball to use for fun to shag and hit some homers?\u201d\nAny, really, that are 9-in circumference, 5 oz in weight, and are a cork-&-rubber pill encased in yarn and leather.

The also-rans on Ali\u2019s record\u2014Jerry Quarry, Ron Lyle, Zora Folley, Oscar Bonavena, Bob Foster, Ernie Terrell\u2014were as good as all but two or three opponents Joe Louis beat during his 11 years as champ.\"\nBBC boxing writer and historian Ben Dirs said of Ali compared to Wlad Klitschko and other fighters of this generation, \"Ali reigned in the most talent-rich era of heavyweight boxing, winning the title from the fearsome Sonny Liston in 1964, winning it again from the even more fearsome George Foreman 10 years later and beating greats such as Floyd Patterson, Joe Frazier and Ken Norton in between.\"\nAli met great punchers and beat them:\nRon Lyle, Earnie Shavers and George Foreman\nAli met great boxers and beat them:\nJimmy Ellis, Floyd Patterson, Zora Folley, Jimmy Young\nAli met great boxer/punchers and beat them:\nSonny Liston.\nAli met the greatest swarmer of them all, and beat him twice:\nJoe Frazier\nTo quote Ali, \"I whopped them all!\"\nIn his book \"Going the Distance,\" Ken Norton said, \"out of all the fighters I was in with, Frazier, Foreman, Holmes, Ali was the best.\" Not only that, Ken said, \"he was the best I ever saw, period.\"\nLet us look at the numbers and examine who Ali met in the ring:\nAnthony Mason, boxing writer, said \"I think the only way to fairly rank a boxer's place in history is by comparing their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. And that does not mean just wins and losses - it is too easy today to fight only has beens or never will be's, and run up the record.\u201d\nAli faced 18 top 100 heavyweights, and beat all but one, and when he was 39 and ill\n#2 Archie Moore (ranked as light-heavyweight but fought for heavyweight title twice)\n#4 Sonny Liston\n#13 Joe Frazier\n#14 Larry Holmes\n#15 Floyd Patterson\n#19 George Foreman\n#20 Bob Foster (ranked as light heavyweight but fought for heavyweight title twice)\n#22 Cleveland Williams\n#28 Eddie Machen\n#34 Ken Norton\n#36 Zora Folley\n#43 Henry Cooper\n#44 Ernie Terrell\n#48 Jimmy Ellis\n#51 Karl Mildenberger\n#57 Oscar Bonavena\n#67 Jerry Quarry\n#68 Ron Lyle\nAli faced 18 top 100 all time heavyweights in 26 fights, he beat 17 of the 18 at least once, 5 of them twice!\nAdd in #116 Joe Bugner, #118 Doug Jones, #124 Jimmy Young, #131 Mac Foster, #141 Earnie Shavers, and Ali faced 23 fighters in the top 150 and beat 22 of them at least once in 31 fights! That is by far the best competition faced and beaten in heavyweight history.\nIn comparison, to Ali beating 17 of 18 top 100 fighters, 5 of them twice, Joe Louis fought 15 top 100 heavyweights in 17 fights, beating 13 of them at least once, and beat only one twice. Joe only faced 16 in the top 150 to Ali\u2019s 23.\nThere is just no comparing anyone else\u2019s record of meeting and beating the best to Ali\u2019s.\nSecond, his total accomplishments are the best in heavyweight history\nMuhammad faced and defeated two of the most intimidating fighters in history, Sonny Liston at 22 years old, Fight City\u2019s most intimidating fighter in history, and then defeated Big George Foreman, #5 most intimidating fighter in history, a decade later at 32. These two are also called the two strongest fighters to ever enter the ring according to Johnny Tocco, who worked with Foreman, Tyson and Sonny Liston, said of the three, Liston hit the hardest, and was the strongest, with Foreman second over Tyson.\nAnd Ali beat them both, the #4 and #19 all time heavyweights, ten years apart!\nAli is the first and only three-time lineal World Heavyweight Champion.\nAli was and remains the first World Heavyweight Champion to come back from retirement and regain the undisputed title.\nAli beat 14 world champions, from the years 1962 to 1978, over an incredible 16 year period.\nAli won twenty-two World Heavyweight Championship fights over a 14 year period.\nAli made a total of nineteen successful title defenses of the undisputed title, nine during his first reign and ten during his second reign, second only to Joe Louis.\nAnother record he set which stands today, he has a record of 11-0 in rematches. Ali faced a heavyweight record of 8 Hall of Fame fighters, winning all but one, and making 11 total fights against Hall of Famers.\nAll eight of the Hall of Famers who faced him said he was the greatest heavyweight who ever lived, including Hall of Famer Larry Holmes, who fought him when Ali was 39 and ill.\nAli was named Ring \"Fighter of the Year\" for 1963, 1966, 1972, 1974, 1975 and 1978. Ali was named the Boxing Writers Association of America \"Fighter of the Year\" for 1965, 1974 and 1975. Ali was named Sports Illustrated \"Sportsman of the Year\" for 1974. Ali was named The Ring \"Fighter of the Decade\" for the 1970s. Ali was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in 1983. He received the Boxing Writers Association of America James J. Walker Memorial Award for 1984.\nAli was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1986. He was inducted into the The Ring Boxing Hall of Fame in 1987. Ali was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990. Ali was named \"Athlete of the Century\" by GQ magazine in 1998. He was named \"Sports Personality of the Century\" by the BBC in 1999, and \"Sportsman of the 20th Century\" by Sports Illustrated in 1999.\nThird, Ali never ducked or avoided anyone\nAli fought every single top contender during his title reign, every, single, one.\nAli offered rematches to those he had defeated, and the only titlist who he did not rematch, George Foreman, had been offered a rematch, but lost to the #2 contender and retired.\nFinally, most experts believe his skills were the best of all the heavyweights, ever\nMike Tyson, a student of boxing to this day, and a guy who has probably watched more boxing film than any other boxing historian, said of fighting Ali:\n\u201cNobody beats Ali,\u201d Mike said when asked if he\u2019d have beaten him, prime against prime.\nAnd Mike explains that those who grew up in the \u201980s and \u201990s and perceived Tyson as the winner just because he hit harder and had bigger muscles let themselves be fooled by Ali\u2019s physical appearance. \u201cAli is a fuckin\u2019 animal,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cHe looks more like a model than a fighter, but what he is, he\u2019s like a Tyrannosaurus Rex with a pretty face. And fast, Lord God he was fast!\u201d\nBut could you have beaten him on your best day, the reporter said?\n\u201cNOBODY beats Ali,\u201d Mike emphasized, saying Ali was simply too fast, and too skilled.\nIn the May 5, 1969 issue of Sports Illustrated, Ali\u2019s jab was measured with an omegascope. Ali\u2019s jab, it was found, could smash a balsa board 16.5 inches away in 19/100 of a second. It actually covered the distance in 4/100 of a second, which is the blink of an eye.\nHis phenomenal speed in his prime never ceases to amaze people who saw him in person, or even on TV, or who have studied him later on film. The late Jimmy Jacobs, then the owner of the world's largest fight film collection, once also measured Ali's jab by an omegascope against every other fighter he had in his collection - and he had tape on every fighter who had ever been filmed.\nAli\u2019s jab was not only faster than any heavyweight of all time - including Larry Holmes by a wide margin, but Jacobs found that Ali was faster than any middleweight he measured - for instance, Sugar Ray Robinson's jab took 8.5 frames of film. Ali's took only 6.5!\nCREDIT COX\u2019S CORNER MONTE COX\nCanadian heavyweight George Chuvalo said in Ring of Ali\u2019s speed, \"my plan for the fight was simple: as the shorter guy, I wanted to stay close to Ali, nullify his speed and prevent him from using the whole ring. I also wanted to make it rough. The rougher, the better. But it took all of about 30 seconds for me to realize he was the fastest fighter I\u2019d ever seen. It\u2019s one thing to expect it; it\u2019s another thing to feel it, live it.\"\n\"You can't hit him,\" said Cleveland Williams, \"you just cannot hit him!\" According to CompuBox, Williams landed only 10 punches the entire fight. Williams said \"I threw hooks, I threw uppercuts, I missed them all! Hell, I couldn't even land a jab!\"\nZora Folley, after facing Ali, said \"you can't hit him! But he sure can hit you.\"\nThe great Rocky Marciano, who filmed the \"computer fight\" with Ali in 1969 while Ali was banned from boxing, said of Ali \"the fastest man on wheels, no fighter who ever lived was that fast.\" Rocky, when asked how good he thought Ali was, said \"most would make the guy before they made him stop fighting \u2013 the fighter that destroyed Cleveland Williams, before time off took so much of the skip and slip from his legs \u2013 a strong favorite over anybody, anytime, anywhere, including me.\"\nBoxing Historian Monte Cox wrote that \u201cMuhammad Ali was the most naturally gifted heavyweight champion in history.\u201d\nThe record bears that out.\nhttp://coxscorner.tripod.com/196...\nIn his book \"Going the Distance,\" Ken Norton said, \"out of all the fighters I was in with, Frazier, Foreman, Holmes, Ali was the best.\" Not only that, Ken said, \"he was the best I ever saw, period.\"\nIn addition, mental determination, strength of will, desire, ability to adapt, all factor in to who was most skilled - and again, Ali wins. Ring IQ? His adapting on the fly against Foreman in Zaire is the poster child for ring intelligence.\nAnd inner strength? Mike Tyson spoke of Ali\u2019s mental strength and will, in a 2012 interview with Thisis50 | If it's Hot it's Here!\n, also described how Ali collapsed to the canvas after stopping Joe Frazier in their third fight in 1975. Mike said in awe \"He had too much pride. He'd rather die than let somebody beat him,\" said Tyson.\nWhen asked again who would've won between the two had they met at age 20, Tyson didn't hesitate in answering:. \"Never stopping and he\u2019s dead tired? I can\u2019t beat that man. Hell fucking no. No fucking way,\" said Tyson.\nAn example of that steely will, on the night he stunned the world and beat George Foreman, sensing the mood in his dressing room Ali asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong around here? Everybody scared? Scared? A little thing like this? This is like another day in the gym.\u201d\nAli was the fastest heavyweight who ever lived, maybe the fastest fighter, period, in addition to having that indomitable will and determination Mike Tyson spoke of.\nMax Kellerman says \"From 1970, when Ali came back from his forced exile, to 1978, when Ali won back his crown for the final time (against Leon Spinks), Ali shared the very top shelf with Joe Frazier and George Foreman, and the three of them were supported by Ken Norton and Joe Bugner and, in the beginning of the decade, Oscar Bonavena, Jerry Quarry and Jimmy Ellis, and at the end of the decade Ernie Shavers, Ron Lyle and Jimmy Young. Ali fought them all, and many of the others fought each other. The greatest heavyweight era ever.\"\nConclusion:\nChuck Wepner, before he met Ali for the title, made a promise to his wife before he left for the arena. \"That night, before the title bout, I bought my wife a powder blue negligee, and I gave it to her, I said, \u2018Wear this to bed tonight, because tonight you\u2019re going to be sleeping with the heavyweight champion of the world.\u2019 Anyway, after the fight, I come back to the room, I walked in, and she\u2019s sitting on the edge of the bed in the negligee. She says, \u2018Am I going to Ali\u2019s room, or is he coming to mine?\"\n\"I came to love Ali,\u201d two-time foe Floyd Patterson told David Remnick for his book King of the World. \u201cI came to see that I was a fighter and he was history.\" Patterson went on to say. \"Before they took boxing away from him for three years, he was the best fighter who ever lived, period.\u201d\nLegendary American boxing historian and writer Bert Sugar, said of Ali, \"True greatness comes from within as well as the physical, and Ali had it all. On his best night, he beats any fighter who ever lived.\"\nLennox Lewis said \"Ali was the greatest heavyweight EVER in my opinion.... I would never put myself in his class...and never have.\"\nMax Kellerman makes the case for Ali best: \"if you count from the day he dethroned the most feared boxing champion ever, he dominated his sport for 14 years! NO one else ever did that.\"\nCREDIT TO:\nAll rankings, statistics to Boxrec\nGoing the Distance by Ken Norton\nChuck Wepner calls the day he lost to Muhammad Ali the greatest of his life\nCox\u2019s Corner and Monte Cox\nFight City \u201cTop 12 Most Intimidating Boxers\u201d by Robert Portis\nMax Kellerman and ESPN As heavyweight eras go, this one is very good\nMike Tyson and Thisis50 | If it's Hot it's Here!\n,\nMuhammad Ali: A Life by Thomas Hauser\nMuhammad Ali: A View From the Corner by Dr. Ferdie Pacheco\nThe Devil and Sonny Liston by Nick Tosches\nThe Greatest: My Own Story by Muhammad Ali", "It\u2019s still Ali. He had the best quality of opposition of any heavyweight champion, and comes off looking pretty good from a quantity perspective, as well. He won 2 of 3 from Frazier (whom he probably would have prevented from ever becoming Champion in the first place if he hadn\u2019t been banned in his prime), 2 of 3 from Ken Norton (who really performed especially well against Ali, with all three fights being arguable), and went undefeated against the likes of Sonny Liston, George Foreman, and Floyd Patterson, just to name the fellow Champions.\nHe slipped up and lost to the mediocre Leon Spinks as he was on his way out, but even then he won the rematch by a wider margin than he lost the first.\nThe only guys he ever ended up second-best to were future Champion Larry Holmes and future titlist Trevor Berbick, but both of those were after coming out of a retirement he most certainly should have stuck with, as he was already neurologically declining.\nAnd then there\u2019s the eyeball test. Watch him against Liston or Patterson or most any of his fights in the 60s, and with a trained eye it will become obvious that very few heavyweights in history have the tools to consistently compete with him in his prime. He\u2019s way too fast and way too in control of distance for many guys to get much done against him at that point in his career.", "Ali is \u201cKing of the Ring\u201d too. He beat Archie Moore, Henry Cooper, Floyd Patterson, Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Ken Norton, Ron Lyle, Earnie Shavers, Joe Bugner, Jerry Quarry, Oscar Bonavena-a heavyweight hall of fame. Ali defeated all of his opponents except Holmes and Berbick who he never should have been liscenced to fight-because he was already sick with Parkinson\u2019s. He was 11\u20130 in rematches. No one else faced the murderer\u2019s row of opposition that he did and came out a winner. He won the title 3 times between 1964\u20131978. Rocky Marciano-who retired undefeated-only had 6 title defenses. Ali had 22. And 3 of Marciano\u2019s defenses were against light-heavyweights-175 lbs-2 against Ezzard Charles and one against Archie Moore. Moore had Marciano on the floor in the 2nd round of their title fight. He KO\u2019d Jersey Joe Walcott at 38 and Joe Louis at 37 afte he\u2019d been retired 2 years. Marciano never beat a champion under 33 years old. MIke Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis-all great champions-none can say they faced the Murderer\u2019s row that Ali did. You have to look at quality of opposition. For example-some people say Floyd Mayweather is the best welterweight because he\u2019s \u201cUndefeated\u201d. But he cherry-picked his opponents, ducked anyone who could beat him, and for his \u201cRecord Breaking\u201d 50th fight picked a guy who\u2019d never had an amateur or pro boxing match in his life. And it took Floyd 10 rounds to beat him. So he doesn\u2019t rank with Ali, or Sugar Ray Leonard-who beat Hearns, Duran, Hagler, etc. Or Sugar Ray Robinson who fought LaMotta, Fullmer Basilio, Graziano, etc.", "A young Muhammad Ali is one of the Best ever. Not the 70\u2032s version of Ali.", "Just in the ring Ali.He is rated number 1 in most really good hall of fame heavyweight lists.Why because he beat more Hall of fame opponents than anyone including the two hardest punching heavyweight champions. He also beat 19 out of the top 100 heavyweights of all time!", "just in the ring I still go with ali, he fought the best ALL the time", "How many times have you seen the number one and number two champions of all time fight while they are still the number one and number two fighters in the world?\nRocky and Louis fought, but Joe was hardly the number one or two champion at the time, nor, in my opinion were Rocky and Joe the number one and two champions of all time.\nAsk yourself, did Ray Robinson ever fight the number two middleweight of all time while Ray was number one?\nMaybe someone can show me to be wrong about this, but off the top of my head, I don\u2019t think the number one and number two greatest of all time fought each other while they were still number one and number two. Duran/Leonard, nope. Leonard/Hearns, nope. Sanchez/Gomez, now that\u2019s a possibility but Gomez was not rated best or second best at featherweight when they fought and Gomez isn\u2019t the second greatest featherweight of all time.\nYou could make an argument that if Spence fought Crawford, we could have such a bout, but can you convince the pundits that Spence and Crawford are the best welterweights of all time? As super as each of these fighters are, I\u2019m not sure about that.\nBottom line, a twenty-two year old Clay fought who I believe to be the second greatest heavy of all time in Sonny Liston, while Ali was the best and Sonny was the second greatest heavy at the time. So true that Liston may have been sixty-seven years old when they fought and Liston may have had an injured shoulder, but on that day in 1964, I believe the greatest heavyweight of all time fought the second greatest heavyweight of all time, while both were still one and two.\nAnd I\u2019d ask you this; who other than Clay/Ali could have beaten Sonny Liston in the early sixties? And I\u2019m talking about any heavyweight champion before or since. Liston would have destroyed them all. From Joe Louis to Tyson Fury and everyone in between. The only two heavies I\u2019d give a chance against Liston of the late fifties, early sixties were Larry Holmes and Lennox Lewis and we know Lennox could be put to sleep. Holmes had the only weapon that could give Sonny problems but Sonny\u2019s jab, while not as great as Larry\u2019s, was more powerful.\nListon had an 84 inch reach and I\u2019ll take Sonny\u2019s power over Foreman, Shavers and Wilder seven days a week. And Sonny was a much more talented fighter than any other \u201cslugger\u2019 in the game.\nWhen you recognize Sonny for what he was, even at his age and with a possible shoulder injury, you realize that Ali is the GOAT.", "Still Ali. He never boxed with his hands up until after he had languished in prison and won his first 31 fights before losing to another contender for best boxer, Joe Frazier. I mean, Ali would call the round that he'd knock you out, then go and do it. He was super athletic, had tremendous punching power, and was very elusive. Also, he was 55-2 before his last 4 fights when he was nearly 40. He had only lost to Joe Frazier and Ken Norton. He's the guy who I would bet on vs any heavyweight in any era.", "Joe Louis has my vote, he was a complete fighter that fought and beat them all as a champion.", "The three greatest were Ali, Louis and Dempsey in no particular order.", "Ali.

Ali and Norton had 3 epic bouts between 1973 and 1976 with Ali winning 2 and Norton one. Ali was not up to a 4th fight with Norton, and took the Spinks fight as a discretionary defense and an easy payday, before having to do the mandatory against Norton. But Spinks winning threw a monkey wrench in that. Jose Sulamain-the WBC\u2019s corrupt president who was in Don King\u2019s pocket, demanded Spinks fight Norton within 60 days or be stripped of the title. This was unheard of-any champion, especially a brand-new one who had just won the title had 1 calender year to fight the #1 contender in a mandatory defense under WBA / WBC rules. So Spinks should have had until February 1979 to face Norton. Ali and his handlers were stunned, and were desperate for Ali to regain the title. Spinks, who was paid a paltry $170,000 for the first fight-was offered 3.75 million to give Ali a rematch. Spinks accepted, of course. Sulamain and King stripped him of the WBC title and gave it to Norton. Spinks, Ring Magazine, and the entire world didn\u2019t care. Everyone recognized Spinks as the champ, and he still held the WBA title belt. Norton lost the WBC title in his first defense in June 1978 in an epic bout with Larry Holmes-It was a \u201cRocky and Creed\u201d slugfest, and Holmes rally in the last minute of the 15th round may have earned him the narrowest of Split Decisions to win the title. Holmes held the WBC title until 1983 when he was stripped in a pissing match over money. However-Holmes was still recognized as champion by the public and the IBF-and went 48\u20130 until 1986-when he was upset in a controversial decision by Michael Spinks, Leon\u2019s brother-who had been light-heavyweight champ and moved up to heavyweight. Anyhow-the rematch between Leon and Ali was held in September 1978. Ali trained like a man posessed, and got in great shape. Unlike the first fight-he didn\u2019t allow Spinks to pressure him. Having taken the measure of Frazier twice-and Norton twice-what was this punk going to show him, now that he was in shape? He met Leon in the center of the ring, used his strength, granite chin, ring generalship and experience, and smothered Leon\u2019s swarming style jabbing and grabbing his way to an easy 15 round decision. Sportswriters said-that\u2019s what he should done the first time-and the great disturbance in the force was quelled, and all was right in the world again. Ali was champ again-becoming the first man to ever win the title 3 times. Ali retired, and should have stayed retired. Instead-he had 2 more fights in 1980 and 81 against Larry Holmes and Trevor Berbick, when he was in the early stages of Parkinson\u2019s and never should have been liscenced by the crooked boxing commissions. Spinks never really had a career after that.

Meaning it's less clear what the differences are between the two subdivisions although admittedly there are many differences besides simply one utilizing a bowl format opposed to the champioinship aspect commonly utilized within FCS. The reason why it matters is if there aren't distinct differences there's little advantage really to including one before another. Therefore little difference and might result in unification.\nWhich is something I'm mostly favorable toward. A unification of assets might make sense and I think it could result in a better, more comprehensive and ultimately a more charitable result. Referencing last season it isn't difficult to see where unification might lead. A larger group of teams (collective) through which one national championship might follow might be a better result. Rather than having separate titleists why not unify it so that there is a consensus of opinion?

It may have to do with our success, with so many national championships over the last 20 years, but people tend to think there is a bias towards the SEC; like the voters and pollsters play favorites with us.\nIt may also be a leftover remnant of the Civil War (the War of Northern Aggression! LOL). The Southern states have often been treated as a stepchild in this country. Seen as not as ambitions or intelligent. I know that\u2019s a thought of many moons ago, but remnants of that thought remain. But because we\u2019re all kind of lumped into this same \u201credneck\u201d, \u201cbackwoods\u201d thought, we kind of bond together more than other places. We are by nature kind folks. We don\u2019t wish bad on anyone. And we\u2019re not trying to keep anyone from having theirs as long as we get ours. Now, no one is cheering for their rivals explicitly. I\u2019m not cheering for Alabama or Florida anytime soon. But I will say this - it IS a positive for the teams you play to do well because it advances your own resume\u2019. For instance - this year, LSU was undefeated. That\u2019s good anytime, but remember a few years back UCF went undefeated as well. No one gave them as much credit because they played in a lesser conference. They only played 2 ranked teams in the regular season, and one in a bowl game. LSU beat 3 top 5 teams, 4 top 10 teams, and 6 top 15 teams (according to their end of season rankings. More were ranked when they played them, and some were ranked higher when they played). There was a benefit to Auburn and Alabama and Florida doing well this season. No one was actively cheering for them to win all the games they did, but every win each of those teams got made LSU\u2019s season that much more dominant.\nSo I get that you are never going to cheer for Michigan. But you DO want Michigan to do well, otherwise any win you have over them is less meaningful. I get the tradition of the rivalry always makes it important, but for rankings, for people to look at your program as dominant, you need your rivals to play well too.\nAnd what you\u2019re talking about is not necessarily about Michigan. It would be more about the Big10. When the season ends and your conference goes off to play other conferences in bowl games, I\u2019d like to think you want your conference to win. It helps to validate all your wins as strong. Last bowl season, the SEC had 9 of it\u2019s 14 teams in bowl games, as did the Big10. The Big10 however went 4\u20135 in their bowl games while the SEC went 8\u20132, the extra game being the national championship game. I absolutely cheered for SEC teams in all their games because those 8 wins reaffirm that the SEC is the strongest conference in the country.

What is your draft position? What players are you losing (net of any free agent signings)? Is quarterback a critical position of need?\nIf you are drafting after the top 10 spots or so, then you most likely are reaching to pick based solely on position, unless you are well sorted at the handful of positions that are typically the highest-valued in the draft - QB, Edge rusher, and LT. Teams that have met these needs coming into the draft can usually afford the luxury of taking a position player on the basis that, early enough in the draft, the best position players on the board are also among the best athletes. So taking a highly-regarded WR, DB or LB in the first half of the first round can be a good move.\nQuarterbacks are often the most limited resource, because typically a team either has an incumbent franchise QB that is not going anywhere (so spending high draft picks on a stud would be wasted), or picks late enough that they can\u2019t trust that the very small number of QBs that can be expected to start as rookies will still be available. So for instance, The Cincinnati Bengals in 2020 had both great need and the #1 overall pick, so if they didn\u2019t take Joe Burrow, it would have been a monumental waste of the perfect opportunity to sort out their QB situation for the foreseeable future. Now, it\u2019s always possible for a #1 pick to be a bust (I mean, look at Ryan Leaf going #2 overall and then just being a complete horror show with a laughably short career), but for a #1 overall pick to turn out to be a complete miss is pretty amazingly bad luck for a team, and if you\u2019re picking #1, you\u2019re already so bad that you can only go up from there. I mean, the Cleveland Browns picked #1 overall two years in a row in 2017 and 2018, but that translated into a pretty strong improvement in 2019. Unfortunately, the problem was that they hit that bit of bad luck in that Baker Mayfield turned out to not be a world-class NFL QB, even though he may have been arguably the best of that class.\nSo, lastly, it comes down to the change in composition of your team in the off-season. Sometimes you just have someone leave in free agency, or retire, and don\u2019t have a quality starter at that position, and you have two options - replace that player via free agency, or reach down for a player that doesn\u2019t rate that high of a pick, but isn\u2019t still going to be there in the next round. So you have someone like Cesar Ruiz being picked #24 by the Saints, even though they drafted a starting center last year, and Ruiz was pegged as an early-second-round talent. The pick is a bit strange on the face of it, because Ruiz doesn\u2019t appear to meet a crucial need and also doesn\u2019t seem to have been the best athlete when NO was on the clock. They seemingly were trapped in that no-man\u2019s-land between having a worthy player that fit one of their more pressing needs, and they must have felt that the better athletes available were at positions where they were already set, so there was no point in bringing in a guy in the first round that is just likely to be cut in camp because he\u2019s got no roster spot. Ruiz\u2019s up-side is that he may be able to play Guard, so he gives NO a prospect to replace an aging player in a year or two, who can also be a backup Center. Is that a good enough argument to justify that pick? Who knows. Maybe that guy will end up being an All Pro before his career is over.", "Not that I am an expert or anything like that, but in some cases I would have to say so. Look at Lamar Jackson, not the best passer for quarterbacks but probably the best pure athlete and look at what he has accomplished. Terrell Owens is another example of a great athlete, or even Bo Jackson. Now when you combine that athleticism with great ATTITUDE then you really have something. Some people are just better athletes and can adapt to situations on the field better than others.\nI think that is why the Eagles drafted Jalen Hurts in the second round even though fans questioned the pick. Obviously Jalen is a superior athlete, but the fans felt that the Eagles should have drafted to NEED instead of best athlete available. Can the team fit the best athlete available into the team concept is another issue that teams face. Jamal Adams of the Jets is an example of a superior athlete who the organization may have issues with. Do they fit into the team concept? Did Terrell Owens fit into the team concept? You may or may not agree whether he did or did not, but make no mistake he was a great receiver who the defense had problems with. And finally the maybe best example is Deion Sanders who is the greatest cornerback of all time (Primetime). He made teams he was on Super Bowl contenders just by his presence. Blazing speed and pure athleticism beyond the reach of mere mortals, he set the stage for drama when he touched the ball. He even played 2 sports like Bo Jackson.\nSo yes picking the best athlete does have it merits if you are able to harness that pure athleticism into the team concept as they blend in.", "This is a classic choice between the team winning as a profitable business or the team winning games/championships.\nIf you wish to win as a profitable business, you pick the best athlete available. Best doesn\u2019t always mean the best player. It may mean the most popular (i.e. Brian Bosworth). The idea is to sell tickets/jerseys and have a bankable commodity to sell/trade to other teams in the future. You currently see teams in the NFL eating up quarterbacks due to this strategy.\nIf you wish to win games/championships, you employ one of two strategies. You can pick a player which fits the teams current needs (like you need a linebacker, so you pick a linebacker). Some coaches also believe in picking the best player based on character and \u201cwinning spirit.\u201d The player may not be the best athlete or a needed position, but they show incredible tenacity, are loyal/coachable and don\u2019t have any \u201cdistractions\u201d in their personal lives.", "It is the strategy that most teams use and IMO the best.

This business has come a long way from those days where it was known as \u201cThe Grunt and Groan Business.\u201d\nMany people look at the wrestling business as something less than a sport and it\u2019s understandable. Not too many people believe that Pro Wrestling is a sports-like competition today. But that is what the wrestlers are attempting to portray inside the ring.\nSome people say, \u201cLook it\u2019s fake, they aren\u2019t trying to win.\u201d\nTo this I respond, \u201cDo you watch real wrestling.\u201d They always look confused and say, \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing.\u201d\n\u201cActually, there is and it\u2019s in High School, College, and the Olympic\u2019s. Those wrestlers are wrestling to win.\nIn High School and College, it\u2019s called Scholastic Wrestling and sometimes it\u2019s known as \u201cfolkstyle\u201d Wrestling. And in the Olympics, it\u2019s called Freestyle Wrestling or Greco-Roman Wrestling.\nAnd speaking of the Olympics, you know there are other ways to win\u2026right?\nMany of the Athletic Events are judged on the performances of the Athletes, like Diving, Figure Skating, and Gymnastics, these are just a few.\nAnd really if you think about it, that\u2019s closer to how wrestlers are judged by their employer. The better performance, the more fans, the more fans you draw, the more you get paid. The talent to be both an actor and a wrestler that is good enough at what you do to be able to do that is what\u2019s valuable to your boss.\nSo valuable you\u2019re paid a salary that\u2019s many times better than the average worker today.

The more tickets you sell the more the boss will pay.\nWhen you are no longer valuable to the boss, you\u2019re let go, gone.\nIt\u2019s a dog eat dog business and believe me, there are some badass dogs out there.\nBut if you can reach the Golden Ring, it\u2019s the ride of a lifetime.", "Actors more than athletes although they ahve to be in very good condition to act as they do.", "Both.

The other parts are when they have to talk on the microphone to talk about their opponents that they'll be wrestling for that night or for when they're wrestling them at a event that hasn't happened yet but will take place in the same month in the future (such as a pay per view).

With such a huge history the league has some amazing facts and events that not every fan is aware of. There are hundreds of interesting facts to share about teams and players, but for the list, we have picked the top 10 NBA facts you must know.\n1. NBA banned Air Jordans once\nIf you play basketball at any level, then most probably one of the best all-time basketball sneakers are on your wish list. Born in 1985 Air Jordans were a sensation but not without a patchy start. During those players were told to wear only shoes that matched their uniforms. Although most sneakers were white during that time, Jordan\u2019s came in red and black combinations that matched the uniform a Chicago Bull, a similarity that former NBA commissioner David Stern hated.\nMichael Jordan was fined $5000 by Stern for every game he played in those sneakers. However, Jordan never cared as the fine was paid by Nike on his behalf, a small price for what the brand gained.\n2. The tallest player and the shortest player in NBA history were on the same team once\nThe tallest player ever in NBA, Manute Bol (7\u2019 7\u201d) and the shortest one Muggy Bogues (5\u2019 3\u201d) both played for Washington Bullets in 1987-1988 season.\nWhile Bol was an amazing shot-blocker and rebounder, he remains an underrated three-point shooter in NBA history. Bogues, on the other hand, was famous for his steals and known for his amazing athletic performance. He was so small for the game that during one of the matches he went through the legs of a player.\n3. LeBron James is ambidextrous\nJanuary 3, 2020; Los Angeles, California, USA; Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) controls the ball against the New Orleans Pelicans during the second half at Staples Center. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\nArguably one of the most dominant NBA players presently, LeBron James is always seen using his right hand for shooting but outside the court, he does pretty much everything with his left hand. He can be usually seen writing or eating with his left hand.\nSpeaking on the same James told, during his childhood he tried to imitate his idols Penny Hardaway and Michael Jordan which led him to shoot with his right hand because they did the same. This fact leaves us wondering what might happen if LeBron starts shooting with his left hand too!!\n4. Paul Pierce played every game in 2000-01 season even after getting stabbed 11 times\nJul 10, 2019; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Former basketball player Paul Pierce arrives on the red carpet at Microsoft Theatre. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\nIn a late-night brawl at a club on the fateful night of 25 September 2000, Paul Pierce was stabbed 11 times when he tried to stop a fight in a club in Boston. He was stabbed in his neck, back and face, but was taken to hospital on time by his teammate Tony Battie. He has to undergo lung surgery.\nHowever, his injuries were not enough to keep the player with a concrete mind from playing. Remarkably, he was back on the court just 3 days after the surgery. He played 82 games in 2001-02 period for the Boston Celtics, crazy, isn\u2019t it! But his shows how dedicated Pierce was to the game and his team.\n5. Almost 60% of NBA players go broke after 5 years of retirement\nBased on a study by Sports Illustrated it was found that around 60% of NBA players got into financial troubles within 5 years post-retirement.\nBut the question comes to mind, how NBA players who earn millions go broke, that too in such a short span? The answer is obvious if you look at their lifestyle and spendthrift nature. Cars, shoes, houses and parties are a common part of their luxurious lifestyle along with poor money investments. It makes it easy to imagine how all that money vanishes.\nEvery NBA player can take a page from LeBron\u2019s book who is financially smart and knows the value of money. He has hired people to look after his business and finance.\n6. NBA has never witnessed a quintuple-double\nIf you follow the NBA, you know that double-doubles and triple-doubles are common, but what about quadruple-double?\nIn entire NBA history, only four players ever had a quadruple-double-Nate Thurmond (22 points, 14 rebounds, 13 assists, 12 blocks), David Robinson (34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 blocks), Alvin Robertson (20 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals), and Hakeem olajuwon (18 points , 16 rebounds , 10 assists , 11 blocks).\nAs we mentioned the any of the NBA courts are still to witness a quintuple-double.\n7. Shaquille O\u2019Neal made only one three-point shot out of 22 attempts\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that a four-time NBA champion and 15-times NBA All-Star player who dominated all the aspects of the game will have such low score in three-point shooting. During his career, Shaq attempted 22 three-pointers but was able to convert only one.\n8. The shortest player in NBA history blocked 39 shots\nIf you bet on NBA games, then most probably you will never pick the shortest player on the court as your favorite. But NBA odds aside, the shortest player in NBA history, Tyrone \u201cMuggsy\u201d Bogues who stood only 5\u2019 3\u201d fought his way into the NBA. Not only he made it to the prestigious league but blocked 39 shots throughout his career. Now, that\u2019s extraordinary!\n9. Kobe Bryant\u2019s parents co-signed his first NBA contract\nNov 17, 2019; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Former Lakers player Kobe Bryant acknowledges the crowd during the second quarter against the Atlanta Hawks at Staples Center. Mandatory Credit: Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY Sports\nFor the 1996 NBA draft, Kobe Bryant was the 13th pick, selected by the Charlotte Hornets. However, he was immediately traded by the team to Los Angeles Lakes and as most of us know rest is history. But what some of you might now know is that Bryant was under 18 when he was drafted. His parents had to co-sign his contract on his behalf.\n10. Shaq challenged Hakeem to a one-on-one\nBack in 1995 when the 22 years old Shaq was leading Orlando Magic, the team reached finals. However, another fate awaited Shaq, where he was about to face one of the best all-time NBA centers, Hakeem Olajuwon. Not only Hakeem scored more than 30 points in each game but also outscored Shaq in every department that left the 22 years old frustrated.\nShaq was so humiliated that out of aggression he sent a note challenging Hakeem for a one-on-one after the finals ended.", "Kobe brayant passed away with his daughter Gigi and several others.

You can\u2019t stop it. A MMA fighter is extremely difficult to get to the ground.

Karate- almost no training in this regard\u2026\nIn boxing you simply tie up, get separated by ref and then box some more.

I preface this by answering the obvious comment before it happens: the first UFCs were brutal, but they still had rules and stoppage.\nI will then throw a controversial opinion given the options presented and the general mindset of the martial arts community. Boxing would win. Hands down, and probably faster than any of the others could manage it. Second place would be modern street MMA, then probably jujitsu. Karate and TKF get left out of my answer, as there are a variety of schools of both, each with different merits and flaws.\nJujitsu is brutally efficient in both its traditional and Brazilian forms. It suffers from a fatal flaw in the streets, and that's because of its emphasis on groundwork. DO NOT GO TO GROUND IN A STREET FIGHT. EVER! No matter how good your jujitsu is, it's no match for a boot to the head from your victim's friend that you noticed too late.\nMMA, trained for defense rather than competition is almost as good as boxing. It has diverse methods, fighters can usually take punishment, and it's relatively easy to find a school. However, it takes a \u201cwide river\u201d approach, spreading itself a bit thin amongst lots of techniques, and it too relies a bit heavily on wrestling and groundwork.\nWhy boxing? I hear you ask. Those jokers don't even kick. They don't throw. They don't tap others out. This is all true. There are three major factors in their favor.\nBoxers. Are. Fast. Mindbendingly so. The slowest amateur boxer's hands are a blur compared to the measured strikes of other arts. This is because they train with them exclusively. They train to hit the hard target that is the head. They train to strike flurries up and down the upper body which are insanely difficult to defend.\nBoxers can take a beating. The boxer with the worst glass chin in the world can take hits that would crumple a karateka or jujitsu player. They train to do this. Their upper body is harder than a rock. Just watch a few videos of Butterbean taking shots for proof.\nBoxers have incredible footwork. Boxers train to fight boxers. This means that they have to learn to avoid all of those aforementioned punches. They learn to move evasively in ways that confound both striking and grappling.\nOf course, they have their weaknesses too, but comparatively speaking, boxers are underrated in the modern martial community.", "The original UFC tournaments proved BJJs dominance against many of these (except for MMA, which didn't exist yet, the closest to my knowledge being combat SAMBO)."], "topic_list": ["Jiujitsu", "Taekwondo (\ud0dc\uad8c\ub3c4/\u8dc6\u62f3\u9053)", "Brazilian Jiu Jitsu", "Karate", "Boxing (sport)", "Mixed Martial Arts", "Martial Arts", "Fighting", "Hypothetical Battles", "Sports"], "view_list": [4, 10, 7, 13, 34, 9, 120, 112, 78], "create_time": "Apr 21, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Manny Santos", "upvote_list": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], "question_title": "Who\u2019d win in a theoretical fight between a Karate, Boxing, MMA, Jujitsu and Taekwondo professional?", "respond_collected": 9, "no_of_view": "1,859", "name_list": ["Jonathan Sparrow", "Sean Tremblay", "Eric Henshaw", "Dwight Woods", "George Rivero", "Simone Donis", "Keth Crotty", "Jerry Miller", "Kane Angelripper"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020", "Apr 28, 2020", "Apr 27, 2020", "Apr 27, 2020", "Apr 21, 2020", "Apr 21, 2020", "Apr 21, 2020", "Apr 21, 2020", "Apr 21, 2020"]}, "246": {"ans_list": ["I would like to say yes.\nIt will depend on the virus & whether or not there are students on campus this fall.

Scrap Iron, who had fought George Foreman, Sonny Liston, and Joe Frazier, said of the three Sonny was the hardest hitter. (though his manager picked Joe Frazier!)\nThe only trainer who worked with them both said Liston was more powerful and hit harder\nTrainer Johnny Tocco, who worked with Foreman, Tyson and Sonny Liston, said of the three, Liston hit the hardest, and was the strongest.\nSo did Emmanuel Steward, who said of Liston, \"he was unbelievably strong, and his punching like a wrecking machine.\"\nKO Numbers are not the end all be all of power discussions, unless you know nothing of boxing, Sonny fought and beat far better competition from day one of his career, and his style was not that of a pure slugger as George\u2019s was\nFanboys chanting statistics, saying \u201cnumbers don\u2019t lie,\u201d forget that numbers do lie, as the old saying Mark Twain loved so much says: \"There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.\"\nPeople cite KO numbers like they are the end all be all of power discussions - they are not. A good example is Vitali Klitschko, whose KO percentage is second only to Marciano\u2019s. (87% to Rocky\u2019s 88%) That is 10 points higher than his brother Wlad Klitschko. But Chris Byrd, who fought them both, said flatly that Wlad hit far harder - yet Wlad\u2019s KO percentage was 10 points lower!\nHow can that be, fanboys ask?\nBecause, according to Manny Steward, Wlad had to guard his chin, and thus was not free to tee off on people the way his brother was - Vitali, with an iron chin, could just beat people up without having to worry about them beating him up the way Wlad did.\nBut there is more:\nWhy do you think George, with a better record on paper, 76\u20135 to Sonny\u2019s 50\u20134, is ranked far behind him in the all time rankings? For those who don\u2019t know, Sonny is ranked #4 by Boxrec, and George is #19.\nSonny fought better competition than George, right from the beginning.\nSonny\u2019s first 10 opponents had a combined record of 109\u201351, and in his 6th fight he was thrown in with all time great, #121 of all time, Johnny Summerlin, who. (Sonny beat him, and when a rematch was scheduled, because Johnny\u2019s manager could not believe it, Sonny beat him again!)\nSonny had been fighting 9 months, and had six fights, when he was thrown in with 18\u20131 Johnny Summerlin, who had been fighting for nearly 5 years!\nYet Sonny beat him on points, because as Summerlin later said, after Sonny\u2019s first jab hit him, he ran for his life.\nNow look at George\u2019s first 10 opponents. They were a combined 87\u201371, and the first time George faced a fighter who ranks in the top 200 was #151 Geraldo Peralta in his 27th fight, plus George having fought in the Olympics where he won Gold!\nGeorge was fed a magnificent diet of tomato cans.\nWe run into this trouble often with fanboys screaming how great Deontay Wilder is as a puncher. In Joe Louis, his trainer, the great Jack Blackburn, one of the 5 greatest trainers in history was quoted saying he could take a low level journeyman and make him 20\u20130, and have him knocking out everyone - until, Jack said, sooner or later he would have to fight someone who could fight.\nAnd it was not just in the beginning, but all through their careers, that Sonny fought tougher competition.\nSonny fought and beat a lot tougher opponents than George, as an all time comparison shows\nSonny Liston faced all 7 time top 100 fighters:\n#2 Muhammad Ali\n#15 Floyd Patterson\n#22 Cleveland Williams\n#28 Eddie Machen\n#36 Zora Folley\n#59 Nino Valdes\n#92 Leotis Martin\nSonny faced 7 top 100 fighters, beating 5 of them, or 72%.\nGeorge faced 5 top 100 opponents:\n#2 Muhammad Ali\n#11 Evander Holyfield\n#13 Joe Frazier\n#34 Ken Norton\n#61 Michael Moorer\nGeorge faced 5 top 100 fighters, losing to 2 for a 60% win rate against top competition.\nSonny was a rare creature, a boxer-puncher of incredible power who did not head hunt\nSonny was that rarest of creatures, a slugger with all time power who could actually box.\nSonny was a vastly underrated boxer, with excellent fundamentals, a poleax jab, and knockout power in either hand. During the 50's, in his prime, he was avoided like the plague, Joe Louis said he was glad he never had to face Sonny.\nSonny Liston was a truly outstanding technical boxer. Despite his awesome strength and power, \u201che took his time to set his opponents up, to gauge their skills and reaction time, before finishing them,\u201d said Angelo Dundee.\nAccording to Muhammad Ali, the second greatest heavyweight of all time, was Sonny Liston. Ali was a great admirer of Liston\u2019s talent, saying that Liston could do just about everything except dance. (and Ali said besides himself, there\u2019d never really been a dancing heavyweight). Ali said Liston had a tremendous jab, could punch with either hand, was smart in the ring and was as strong as any heavyweight he\u2019d ever seen.\nGeorge Foreman said \"Sonny Liston could whip any other heavyweight in history except for Ali.\"\nJoe Frazier, when asked if Larry Holmes had the best jab he had ever seen, said \"nope. Ali's was better.\" Then he paused and said \"and Sonny Liston, of course.\"\nA good barometer of how good Sonny Liston was comes with his twice destroying a very good heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson, in the first round each time - when he was much older than Patterson!\nNor was it a freak accident when Liston wiped the floor up with Patterson - Boxing writer and historian Bobby Franklin said, while marveling at Liston's skills at such an advanced age, \"it is interesting to note that while the fights were blow outs, Liston did not come out swinging wildly. He took Floyd apart methodically, setting his man up with left jabs and solid body shots. Sonny showed fast hands, using an accurate left jab, along with hooks and uppercuts. He had a definite game plan and executed it perfectly. If they fought a hundred times during that period the result would have been the same.\"\nThe fights which best exemplify Liston\u2019s strengths are his two short contests with Cleveland Williams. Monte Cox said it best: \u201cListon used beautiful head movement and what may be the division\u2019s greatest ever jab to avoid most of Williams\u2019 punches and to keep him off balance. Williams does occasionally land with extraordinarily powerful shots, but Sonny shakes each one off. In their combined five rounds of boxing over the course of their two fights, Liston is only shaken briefly once, and never in danger of being dropped. The most astounding thing about his approach is that he is equally comfortable coming forward or retreating\u2014which he does whenever he feels pressured. This runs entirely contrary to the perceived wisdom about Sonny Liston. Although he was a finisher of comparable stature to Dempsey, Louis, Marciano, and Frazier, he was the only member of this shark-like group who was a boxing conservative.\u201d\nBoxing historians consider Charles (\"Sonny\") Liston a great heavyweight. Indeed, Ring magazine ranks Liston as the seventh greatest heavyweight of all time, and boxing writer Herb Goldman ranked him second. Boxing writer Springs Toedo, in his book, The Gods of War, lays out a powerful case that Liston, when at his peak in the late 1950s and early 1960s, could be favored to beat just about every heavyweight champion in the modern era with the possible exception of a young and prime Muhammad Ali.\nBoxrec\u2019s computer, factoring in strength of competition, lists Sonny as #4 all time great, even though he did not start boxing until his mid 20\u2019s, and competed till at least 42, and he was probably far older!\nSonny ended his career 50-4, with 39 KO's, and all his defeats, except one, which he supposedly threw for the Mob, occurred when he was old! Indeed, his last defeat probably occurred when he was over 42 years old! At his peak, boxing historians believe he would have been a match for any heavyweight ever, with again, the possible exception of Ali.\nSonny won 15 of 16 matches after his defeats by Ali, and the only one he lost he was handily winning until getting caught with a lucky punch, when he was at least 42.\nGeorge was a seek and destroy knockout artist in his prime\nYoung Foreman was the most feared heavyweight in history other than Sonny Liston, and Prime Tyson. He had a thunderous, accurate jab, incredible power in both hands, greater strength than practically anyone else who ever set foot in the ring, (with the possible exception of Sonny Liston and Jim Jeffries), he cut the ring off well - had he not fallen to Ali in Zaire, he would have terrorized the heavyweights for a decade.\nPrime George Foreman had Power, (with a capital P) and in his prime, was an astonishingly athletic and fast fighter who cut off the ring as well as anyone since Joe Louis, (who said Foreman cut the ring off better than him, and better than any other fighter, ever). All time greats such as Jack Dempsey and Joe Louis both commented that Foreman may have been the strongest heavyweight hitter that they had ever seen, certainly the strongest since Sonny Liston.\nAngelo Dundee noted this about Foreman before the fight with Frazier for the title: \"He's got a jab like I've never seen on a heavyweight since Sonny Liston. He has a strong left hand. I mean strong. He can stop a man in his tracks.\"\nGeorge Foreman at his awesome 1973 best may have been, except for Liston, the most powerful heavyweight champion ever. At 6\u20193 \u00bd\u201d and 220 pounds, with an 79\u201d reach he was the best of the \u201csuper-heavyweights.\u201d\nAfter his destruction of Ken Norton, he was 40-0 with 37 knockouts, for a knockout percentage of 92.50. In his career Foreman had 15 first round knockouts and 18 second round knockouts. That's 33 knockouts inside of the first 2 rounds! He had 46 knockouts that were 3 rounds or less, which is more than any other heavyweight champion. George Foreman\u2019s incredible two round destruction of Joe Frazier was the most one-sided beating ever delivered upon an undefeated heavyweight champion.\nIn his prime, George brought to the ring not only exceptional raw power and confidence but also a frightening arsenal of various punches. His uppercuts could lift a man off their feet, his hooks were paralyzing, his strong left jab was true, his right hand, although not often thrown straight was a decapitating blow thrown short or long. He used his massive arms to block punches and could parry punches with his rear hand. He would sometimes slap opponent\u2019s guards down with his hands and then batter them with massive power shots to the head and body. The Foreman of 73-74 also may have been the best ever at cutting down and off the ring on his opponents.\nBut Dick Sadler who trained Foreman, had stopped even trying to hone the boxing skills Sonny Liston had installed him - when George would ask what to do in the gym, Sadler would just tell him to go beat the heavy bag, and when asked about it, said nobody could stand up to George.\nUnlike Sonny, who was a true boxing master, George in his first career was a pure knockout artist - and that was all Sadler trained him to be. Sonny, on the other hand, concentrated on his boxing skills, and let knockouts come if they did.\nSonny was far stronger than George, (who is pretty damn strong!)\nWhat did their opponent\u2019s or other fighters say?\nGeorge was simply described as incredibly strong, and his punches extraordinary.\nBut Sonny was described as some sort of superman.\nRocky Marciano said of Liston, \"he isn't faking his toughness, and his strength is just something you got to see, and that jab, he can knock a man out with the jab!\"\nWayne Bethea, a tough journeyman who had never been off his feet, said after being stopped by Liston \"he must have hit me with a horseshoe in his glove!\"\nZora Folley, then #1 contender for the heavyweight title, said when Liston hit him \u201cthe lights went out, when I woke up, I asked Sonny, what happened, and he said \u2018I hit you.\u2019\u201d\nFoley said later, \"I was lucky, Sonny didn't dislike me, so he just beat me up a little.\" Foley went on, \"ain't a man that walks this earth stronger than Sonny Liston.\"\nNino Valdes, as he lay dying from cancer, drugged heavily with morphine, was asked by his family if it hurt, and said \"not as bad as getting hit by Sonny Liston!\"\nCleveland Williams, after almost dying from a police shooting, was asked how bad it hurt, and said \u201cnot as bad as fighting Sonny Liston!\u201d Williams went on to say \"no human being hits as hard as Sonny Liston.\"\nWhen Sonny was getting ready to get out of prison in 1950, in order to showcase his potential - he had never had an amateur or pro fight - the prison athletic director, Father Stephens, arranged to bring in a rising St. Louis heavyweight named named Thurman Wilson, who was 5-2-1 as a pro, to showcase Liston's potential. Wilson expected no trouble with a man who had never had a sanctioned fight, amateur, or professional. The story is that after two rounds, (the exhibition was scheduled for 4) Wilson quit saying \"Better get me out of this ring,\" exclaimed Wilson, \"he is going to kill me.\"\nSir Henry Cooper, the European and British heavyweight Champion who twice fought Ali, and had a who's who of opponents in the 50's and 60's, had one name glaringly missing from his resume: Sonny Liston. When asked why, Sir Henry\u2019s manager said \"I don't even want to see him walking down the street, let alone in a gym!\"\nGeorge was strong enough to pull a car up a hill - but not as strong as Sonny LIston\nGeorge Foreman, who sparred with Sonny in 1968 - when Sonny was at least in his late 30's or 40's - said Sonny was the only man to force him backwards by sheer brute strength.\nA good example of Sonny's sheer strength was an exercise he devised in training camp of loading an industrial sized wheelbarrow full of rocks, and wheeling it up and down a hill. Foreman, 19, and training with \"the old man,\" could only carry one wheelbarrow for every 3 for Sonny. \"His strength,\" said Foreman, \"you just can't believe how strong he was!\" (Foreman later took Sonny's idea, and pulled a car up and down a hill to train!)\nSonny was born into a family that couldn't afford for him to go to school, and when the family mule died, Sonny's father hitched his 9 year old son to the plow and made him the mule.\nSonny, a child, pulled a plow all day that a mule struggled to pull.\n\u201cSonny once started a fight with a cop, beat the cop senseless, snatched his gun, picked him up and dumped him in an alley,\" recounts Jonathan Eig in \"Muhammad Ali: A Life.\"\nEig recounted: \"[Sonny] then walked away smiling, wearing the cop's hat.\"\nArrested 19 times, in prison twice, Sonny once took a gun away from a police officer who was harassing him, beat the officer and broke his knee. On another occasion when he was again being harassed, an enraged Sonny took the officer, literally picked him up over his head, and hurled him into a trash bin.\nGeorge hit hard, but some of Sonny\u2019s feats are literally legendary\nGeorge did knock out people - he even lifted Joe Frazier off the ground and hurled him backwards with his blows!\nBut Sonny Liston did a lot more than that.\nSonny Liston knocking out Wayne Bethea in 1958 in 69 seconds of the first round. Liston dropped Bethea for the first time in his career, knocking out 7 teeth, with 9 more broken! 16 teeth knocked out or broken with one punch!\nBethea was never the same again.\nNor was that the only time Sonny hit men with unbelievable power that eclipse's anything anyone else has done - in the mid 60's, Sonny sparred with Ray Shoeninger in Denver, and he hit him with a jab so hard, the stitching in Ray's protective headgear literally tore and the headgear came apart with the blow, which getting through, knocked out three teeth!\nSonny's first pro fight lasted 33 seconds: Liston leveled Don Smith with his first punch - which was a left jab, and Smith was out for 3 minutes!\nFrom February of 1959, to his march to the title, Sonny decimated the top ten ratings, knocking out 8 out of the top 10 contenders. Only Ingemar Johansson and Henry Cooper, of those fighters rated in the top ten during Liston\u2019s prime years, escaped beatings by him - and they declined to fight him. Only Eddie Machen survived all 12 rounds, when asked how, he said \u201cI ran for my life.\u201d\nHis opponents during this period had a combined record of four hundred nineteen wins with only ninety-nine losses. (Bear in mind that thirteen of those losses came to Liston himself.)\nNO other fighter in history has destroyed the top 10 the way Sonny did.\nIngemar Johannson later co-promoted Sonny\u2019s fights in Sweden, after Ali 2. When asked why he never fought Sonny himself, Johannson quipped that he had no intention of ever doing so, but he would cheerfully promote other men getting beat up by Sonny.\nThurman Wilson, who was 5-2-1 as a pro, and who was brought in to help Sonny show his ability, the pro who quit in the 2nd round because of the terrible beating he was taking?\nWilson never fought again after the beating by Liston.\nFloyd Patterson never, at any point, believed he actually could win against Liston.\nPatterson was so convinced he would lose he brought a disguise to the arena \"so I could get out of the place without anyone seeing how humiliated I was going to be.\"\nIn fact, Patterson wore a fake beard and mustache while fleeing in shame from Comiskey Park and Chicago after his crushing defeat.\nBoxing writer Charles Farrell wrote that \"I asked Floyd (Patterson) who the hardest puncher he\u2019d ever faced was. I thought I knew the answer. But Patterson surprised me. \u201cIngemar Johansson.\u201d (Patterson said)\n\u201cBut Floyd,\" i said, \"you fought Liston twice. Ingemar Johansson?\u201d Floyd smiled sadly, according to Farrell. \u201cOh, but when I fought Ingemar, I thought I was going to win. And of course against Sonny\u2026\u201d\nThe boxing establishment deliberately tried to downplay how great Liston was\nA despicable and deliberate effort by the boxing establishment has caused Sonny name to fade into obscurity. People have forgotten how feared Liston was. By 1964 he was considered unbeatable. He had lost once in 36 bouts \u2013 and that defeat in 1954, during which he suffered a broken jaw but ploughed on, merely added to his reputation. One contemporary profile said he was \"surprisingly fast, remarkably quick\" and noted his punishing jab while the former heavyweight champion Joe Louis admitted, \"I'm glad he wasn't around when I was fighting.\"\nAfter Ali\u2019s first victory over Sonny, a Boxing Illustrated editorial remarked: \"Nobody wants to be reminded of Sonny Liston. The idea is to forget him.\" And shamefully, forget him people did.\nThat is a factor today, when folks who don\u2019t study boxing claim Foreman could hit harder. He couldn\u2019t.\nCleveland Williams, the Big Cat, said \"there's tough guys in this business, and there's mean guys in this business, and then there's Sonny Liston.\"\nPerhaps a profile of the then world champion in the 1964 Boxing\nYearbook captured the awesome power and tortured soul of Sonny Liston best by saying: \"For Sonny Liston, it was easy being a superman. It was being a man that was often difficult.\"\nCREDIT TO:\nAll rankings and statistics to Boxrec\nCREDIT FOR ALL STORIES RELATED AND QUOTES CITED:\nAli: A Life by Jonathan Eig\nBy George by George Foreman\nCox\u2019s Corner and Monte Cox\nThe Gods of War by Springs Toedo\nFloyd Patterson: The Fighting Life of Boxing's Invisible Champion by W.

It probably depended on what punch to. I think liston had better jab but fireman better right", "Respectfully no, Foreman has much more fights than Liston and still has a much more higher knockout ratio than Liston. You want evidence?? don\u2019t just look at their highlights, go look at their stats, numbers don\u2019t lie!!\nForeman at the end of his career had 76 wins, 68 of them were by TKO or KO stoppage, and if you're good at math, that\u2019s a 89% knockout ratio wins, and to be more specific 27 of his 68 stoppages were pure knockouts.\nListon at the end of his career had 50 wins, 39 of them were by TKO or KO stoppages, that\u2019s a 78% knockout ratio wins, 13 of his 39 stoppages were pure knockouts.\nThat alone should tells you who\u2019s the harder puncher here. Matter of fact, Foreman and Liston FOUGHT AND BEAT two fighters in common: Wepner and Johnson. Foreman was able to beat them faster than Liston. To be fair though, Liston didn\u2019t just rely on his punching power like Foreman did, he also utilized his jabs a lot, actually had one of the best jabs in the heavyweight business, probably would\u2019ve had a much higher knockout ratio if he did, but what actually happened is what counts.", "Both were tremendous punchers. Guys who faced both like Chuck Wepner said Sonny made George feel like Mr. friendly. And that getting hit by Sonny was like getting hit by a bat! Chuck had 70\u2019stiches and a broken cheekbone from Liston. Also George said Sonny was the only man to make him backup and return to boxing! So I would and George Liston!", "Liston had more one punch KO`s, Foreman usually needed to land several punches to stop an opponent, Liston knocked Floyd Patterson out in 1 round with his fearsome left hook in two differrenet back to back fights and he knocked Cleveland Williams out in two fights with that same lethal punch, Liston`s hook was more powerful than any single Foreman punch.", "I think the only way to answer this would be to ask the guys who fought them both. Has Ali ever said who was the harder puncher? The caveat to him would be that I don\u2019t know that Liston really hit him as hard as he could. I think Foreman was a sparring partner for Liston, so he would probably know as well. I would look around for common opponents and see what they said.\nI will say though, and this is no knock on Foreman, but Liston was much more skilled than Foreman with his fundamentals. George used to load up a lot and he had a tendency to swing wide. Liston did a little too, especially when he was trying to finish a guy off. I think Sonny had better technique when it came to throwing a straight, hard shot. But I haven\u2019t watched either one of them in a while, so I\u2019m just going by memory.\nI haven\u2019t read the other answers yet, but my other \u201cgo to\u201d would be whatever Howard Schwartz says.", "When Foreman first started out as a professional fighter he sparred and trained with Sonny Liston. This would have been a 20 year old Foreman and a 45 to 48 year old Liston. Foreman has said that Sonny Liston was the only man strong enough to force him backward in the ring. Sonny Liston use to train, in part, by filling a wheelbarrow full of stones and pushing the wheelbarrow up and down a hill, Foreman said he couldn't keep up with Liston. When they sparred Foreman said Liston hit him harder than anyone had in his life. Foreman didnt say that at age 20, he said that after he had been in the ring with Ali, and Frazier, and Norton, and Ron Lyle.\nForeman has said that Liston was stronger than him and I think we can draw from that he believes Sonny Liston hit harder.", "You can look at the stats that might tell you one thing. You may listen to those who were in the ring with both of them and you will get different answers, but I base my take on one fight and I\u2019ve mentioned this before.\nBig George knocked down Joe Frazier six times and Joe got up each time. George says Joe would still be getting up if the ref didn\u2019t stop it. In my wildest imagination, I don\u2019t see Frazier getting up more than once if he was hit like that by Liston. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t care if Joe had his chin transplanted with granite, nobody gets hit like that by Sonny Liston and gets up more than once.\nAli, who says Foreman was a bigger hitter than Sonny, used the rope a dope against Foreman and got clobbered more than once as George wailed away with every fucking thing he had. I don\u2019t know that Liston ever hit Ali big time in the aggregate seven rounds they fought. Hell, I think Sonny made damn sure he didn\u2019t hit Ali at all in the second \u201cfight.\u201d Regardless, no way Ali was ever hit with Sonny\u2019s best while Ali was hit with everything Foreman had.\nAli repeatedly asked Foreman throughout the fight, \u201cIs that all you got, George?\u201d And it was all George had. Ali never asked Liston that question. Why? Because Ali wouldn\u2019t let Sonny close enough to ask that question and Sonny never caught Ali like Foreman did. And I promise, if Sonny ever caught Ali like Foreman did, Ali wouldn\u2019t be asking Sonny any such question.\nSonny puts Frazier to sleep with one or two shots. Foreman couldn\u2019t come close to doing that. And if you want to go purely by stats, you would probably come up with Earnie Shavers as the biggest puncher ever. While Earnie was indeed a huge puncher, I don\u2019t think statistics always give you the correct answer.", ".\nnot harder. but more precise ,Foreman in younger years bludgeoned his punches, tightened up his delivery in his later years comeback", "Who knows?", "Chuck Wepner fought both of them, less than a year apart, and he repeatedly said Liston was the hardest puncher he ever fought.\n\u201cHe was the hardest puncher that I ever fought,\u201d said Wepner, \u201cIt was like getting hit with a baseball bat.\u201d\nSource: Requiem for a Heavyweight: The Mysterious Death of Sonny Liston | FIGHTLAND\nBut who knows. They were both terrifying punchers. Watching clips of Liston recently, what stood out is how hard his left jab was. It\u2019s a punch that\u2019s usually used to keep some distance, to distract and set up strong punches\u2014it\u2019ll sting someone and irritate them, but it won\u2019t hurt them on its own. Unless it\u2019s Sonny Liston\u2019s\u2014his opponents would get hit with a jab and look like they just got hit with a cannonball. He was knocking people down with jabs.\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked if Foreman\u2019s right hand or hooks or uppercuts were as strong as (or maybe stronger than) Liston\u2019s\u2014but his left jab probably wasn\u2019t as strong. And since the left jab is usually the most common punch thrown and taken (my guess would be 3\u20134 X more than all the other punches), going a few rounds with Liston must have been truly awful.\nI know many people think Clay/Ali won because the fights were fixed, but I think Clay/Ali had the perfect approach to beating Liston\u2014don\u2019t box him, just be so light on your feet that you can dance around the edges of the ring with such swiftness that he can\u2019t hit you. Muhammad Ali may have been the only heavyweight that had the endurance and agility to keep that up all through a match. In the second match, his agility, speed, and precision seems to have been enough to get in a great right hook when Liston wasn\u2019t expecting it.", "Well, Foreman admitted that Sonny Liston was the only man, ever, to make him back up, and it was during sparring and at a point in which not only was Liston past his prime, but also likely close to 50 years old\u2026\nUltimately, any answer, I believe, will be subjective, even though backed by objective facts. Here\u2019s one fact: they are both all-time tremendous punchers and could have knocked out any man in boxing history. They are among the hardest punchers the sports has ever seen.\nNow, comparing the records of both, Foreman gets the upper hand. More knockouts (68 vs. Liston\u2019s 39) and, especially, a better KO ratio (84% vs. Liston\u2019s 72%); Foreman may have fought, and knocked out, generally speaking, more easier opponentes than Sonny (the first 20, or so, fights after his comeback were against very poor competition, for example), but the numbers give him the edge here, and the fact his that he was able to put down legends like Joe Frazier, Ken Norton, Ron Lyle and to TKO George Chuvalo (the guy with the greatest chin in the HW history).\nChuck Wepner and Muhammad Ali fought both men, and they would disagree on which was the hardest puncher. Ali states that \u201cof all the men I have fought, Foreman was the most powerful\u201d, while Liston was the \u201cscariest\u201d (in The Soul of a Butterfly); Wepner, on the other hand, said that nobody hit him harder than Sonny Liston, not even Foreman.\nThe Ring Magazine considers Foreman the 9th greatest puncher of all time - Liston is 15th on their list. Although they were both sluggers, depending on the strenght of their punches to win the fight, they\u2019re offensive style was different: Liston was more mobile and had a more refined punch, while Foreman, usually, would hinge on brute force. I believe Sonny was strongest (the accounts of his training sessions makes us suppose so) and had a harder punch, but Big George\u2019s punching ability is not much lower\u2026 Liston gets my vote, but I respect if anyone thinks differently.", "I feel like he is. He was insanely strong.

According to his words, all players overreact to injuries in order to make referees brandish easy yellow cards. But he used to overreact in order to get some more seconds to relax and reload with energy. Imagine you are 90kg, you are playing as a striker as you always observe the offside line and make numerous runs, it is likely to lose stamina at some point.", "In international soccer, under FIFA Laws, there are no time outs and for the eleven starting players, there are only three substitutions allowed for the entire game.\nTherefore, by \u201cover reacting\u201d to the foul/injury, the player gains a little more time to be treated on the field before the player is removed from the field, the team plays short-handed and then the player is waved back onto the field by the referee.\nTherefore, the over reacting \u201cbuys more time\u201d and everyone, especially the injured player, gets an unofficial Time Out.\nSimple.", "Not sure how familiar you are with football (soccer) so excuse me if I've used simple terms. I watch a lot of football, so I think it's important to point out a distinction here. There are two things at play here: simulation and over-reaction.\nSimulation is the act of pretending to be fouled or embellishing contact to make a foul look worse. So, say a defender slide tackles an attacker, but makes no contact. If the attacker falls there, he is (usually) guilty of simulation (also called \"diving\"). This is illegal in the laws of the game, and is punished with a caution and an indirect free-kick to the other team. Players continue to do it, however, as they can sometimes win a penalty (spot kick at goal from 12 yards, with only the goalkeeper in the way) which is pretty much a guaranteed goal if the foul has taken place in the penalty box. The risk of caution + free-kick if you're caught doing it is generally small when weighed up against getting a penalty, so players keep doing it! It's also quite hard for the referees to spot sometimes, so may go unpunished.\nOver-reaction, which may be more what you're talking about, is when you see players completely over-react to contact that has been made, and he will roll around on the floor clutching his leg. This is not technically illegal in most cases, i.e. if you get hit in the leg and clutch your leg, nobody can really tell how much you've been hurt. However, if you get elbowed in the chest and hold your face, that is simulation, and the punishment as above is appropriate. The reason players over-react is basically two-fold: it's not technically illegal (unless it encroaches into simulation) and it exploits the fact that referees are human. If they see someone go down and rub their shin and get back up, then they will assume the contact is not bad. However, if the player stays down, and requires medical attention or looks to be in a lot of pain, then the referee will think that the contact is very bad and the punishment may be worse.\nI hope that cleared some things up.\nSimulation/diving can be used to win penalties/punishment for opposition players, over-reaction can colour the referees opinion of an incident.", "Easy question. A free kick or a penalty. If they get fouled in the box then they hey a penalty which is basically a free goal.

When parents reward their child for doing well, it is an extrinsic reward. And when children do well because of the feeling of satisfaction they get by accomplishing a goal through their own hard work, with no other reinforcement \u2014 that feeling is intrinsic motivation.\nWhen learning and accomplishment are their own rewards, the learner/actor is capable of using their own inner drive/desire/motivation to keep on learning, to continue accomplishing.\nI know a man who was CEO of a successful corporation. It was part of his job to help the Director of Sales increase sales. They discovered something very interesting. The sales people weren\u2019t sufficiently motivated by money (their salary plus commission). The sales staff were not motivated by state of the art TV or electronics or computers. The only thing that motivated the sales force was the high esteem of the other salespeople. So the CEO and the Director of Sales designed a contest.\nEach salesperson was enrolled in a contest. The ones who exceeded their monthly sales quota had their photo professionally framed, it hung on the wall where the entire company and all clients could see it \u2014 their portrait, their name, their identity honored as \u201cSalesman of the Month.\u201d The salesperson of the month after a year were a group of about five, the best of the sales staff. They had a private dinner with the CEO. Photos were taken and published. All the other salespeople were envious and tried harder. Sales increased tremendously.\nAfter a year they needed another contest. So they designed a way to create an incentive travel contest. Spouses and significant others were included by sending mailers home touting the destination and asking for the home team to root for their significant other\u2019s sales successes.\nAfter a year of Tahiti-themed events each month, photos of Bora Bora and Morea all over the sales room, and photos of sales staff placed strategically near maps of Tahiti and snorkels and masks on the walls as art, everyone was asking each other: \u201cWill you be the one on the beach this winter?\u201d The sales staff were in a frenzy. Wives and husbands and significant others at home were asking every day: \u2018\u2018Will we be the lucky ones and be able to go to Tahiti?\u2019\nAll these people wanted was to be able to have the dopamine/esteem advantage (competitively) over their fellow salespeople.\n\u2014-\nCompare that kind of a competition and the system of extrinsic rewards / bribery with another way. Think of someone who is intrinsically rewarded and who seeks excellence naturally because of the intrinsic feelings of satisfaction and accomplishment that competence and success bring.\nJakob (name changed for privacy) had a great learning coach. Jakob\u2019s coach liked Jakob and taught him how to use positive self talk to persevere when facing a challenging concept, idea, or problem. Jakob was directly and explicitly taught executive functioning skills useful for learning, organizing, memorizing, studying, and solving problems.\nJakob liked the learning coach and was interested and excited to learn with a teacher like that. Jakob looked forward to their times together. The only reward was Jakob\u2019s increasing comprehension, literacy, numeracy, and composition skills.\nJakob was internally motivated. He is amazing and it is because he learned how to learn, how to be self motivated, And how to use the tools he has to learn more.", "External rewards are helpful in the absence of internal motivation. All novices need external rewards because it\u2019s almost impossible to be internally motivated when you\u2019re brand new and really horrible at something.\nIt is completely ok to start kids/people off with external motivation until they get some skills and become internally motivated.\nWhen someone is already internally motivated, offering external rewards can be detrimental to their internal motivation. So definitely stop giving rewards when there\u2019s internal motivation.\nFinally, you can reward kids with other things besides toys. Like verbal praise, quality time with you or with friends, trips, hikes, swimming. All sorts of things. If you like, try some of these out and see if they work. :)", "you don't continue doing that for the rest of their lives.\nI think my parents stopped at the end of middle school.

I\u2019ll touch the wave tips of what I look for when I\u2019m assessing draft prospects for \u201cmy\u201d NBA team, the Toronto Raptors.\nSpeed and quickness.\nSpeed refers to the ability to keep up with the blinding pace of pro hoops. If you are the last one down the floor almost every time, don\u2019t expect to make the final cut.\nQuickness refers to what you do in the first quarter-second after the man you are covering changes hands on the dribble. Can you adjust, or is he by you, and on his way to the hoop? There are countless other examples.\nBody type.\nI pay great attention to extremities. A big man with average-sized feet won\u2019t survive. It\u2019s no coincidence that two of the greatest swingmen ever, Julius Erving and Kawhi Leonard, are blessed with huge hands.\nA big chest is likely to present a problem. Not only will you suffer by not enjoying free arm movement, you will be carrying extra weight. The stress on your joints may lead to injuries.\nContinuing with the upper body - is it too big for your legs? A long trunk with (relatively) short legs may be fine for an NFL lineman, but isn\u2019t for a basketball player.\nFitness level. At training camp, if you are panting after a half-hour, that\u2019s a problem. Your mind will be thinking about how to preserve its oxygen level, not how to defend, or run the variant of the next offensive play. Chunky players risk being cut.\nShooting skill. In today\u2019s NBA, if you can\u2019t score, you can\u2019t play. I am highly skeptical of the notion that coaches can \u201cfix\u201d a fundamentally unsound jump shot.\nBasketball intelligence [BI]. Assessing this \u201csoft\u201d skill is a giant task. There are so many facets: charges taken, assists, opposition passes deflected, steals, turnovers, guards\u2019 rebounds\u2026.\nBI cannot be determined by statistics. You must see the player in games, over and over. Just on assists: how many does your point guard (let\u2019s say) prospect not get credit for because his teammates can\u2019t shoot, and how many \u201chockey assists\u201d does he get? Those kinds of things don\u2019t show up in stat sheets, yet can be invaluable in assessing hidden gems.\nThe question asks specifically about determining who will blossom into a star. I\u2019ve chosen a more modest response, one in which I tell you how I decide who is going to get a training camp invitation. Stardom can\u2019t happen until you are on a roster.\nI hope this helps.", "Basketball is first and foremost a game of athleticism. Size strength speed quickness vertical jump. A second component is the feel for the game. The anticipation of movement and timing- these are also innate skills refined through practice and games. If a player is dominant in college with some combination of the aforementioned skills it's likely he will be good in the league. Zion is a good example.

For those lucky enough to work their matches, both Federer and Nadal stood out to them as being particularly gracious and making their job easier.\nOne thing that fans may not know however is that only THE BEST ballkids tend to work the matches featuring the top players, so these pros are more likely to be pleased with the ballkids because they are the best ballkids.\nBut overall, the general attitude of the pros is that they are grateful for the ballkids. They realize that the kids and most of the staff at a tournament are voluntering their time FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PLAYERS.\nThis general impression can be overshadowed because BAD incidents get noteriety, for instance when a player will get exasperated with a ballkid or they chastise the ballkid for a delay in bringing the towel.\nTaking the ballkids for granted does happen but it tends to be a minority of players.\nThe three that stand out for me as being a ballkid\u2019s nightmare are Maria Sharapova, Sachia Vickery and Richard Gasquet.\nSharapova does not acknowledge a ballkid unless they do something wrong, and she puts them in a position where that is more likely.\nUnlike the great majority of players, Sharapova only wanted to receive balls only from one side when she is serving. There are 2 ballkids in the back of the court who usually have all 6 balls between them for the server.\nShe wants all the balls to come from only one of those ballkids and if they forget or are slow in getting them all to that one ballkid, she gets mad. The ballkids are always on edge when she is playing, and felt under pressure.\nSachia Vickery has a well-deserved reputation on the WTA tour for gamesmanship, like acting as if she is injured between points and then running everything down once the point starts. She tends to turn every match into a situation where everyone is out to get her, from her opponent to the umpire and this even extends to the ballkids. She is just in a foul mood on court and it reflects in her behavior towards the ballkids.\nGasquet is one of those players who just does not acknowledge a ballkid\u2019s existence , but at the same time expect them to be his slaves.\nHe has a unique habit of changing the grip on his racket every changeover, and he takes the old grip and all the packaging and just throws it over his shoulder from his seat on the bench for a ballkid to pick up his trash and get it into the nearby trashcan.\nBut they are the exceptions!!\nIt\u2019s now become a tradition at almost every tournament, including Indian Wells, for the champions of the tournament to spend some time taking photographs with the ballkids at the end of a tournament, in part as a measure of thanks.\nAnd at Indian Wells there is a banquet to thank and reward all the volunteers including the ballkids after the tournament is over.\nThere is absolutely no one who manages, organizes, trains, and acts as ballkids who gets paid - it\u2019s all volunteers.\nThe irony is that the great majority of staff and ballkids are gone by the 2nd week of a tournament, they are not around to get that praise.\nAs the tournament progresses, there are less and less matches so only the most senior staff and the most experienced, top-rated (We grade the ballkids every match!!) ballkids are left when the tournament concludes.\nA last way that the players can show their appreciation is at the conclusion of any tournament the players are surveyed to judge how staff, and even ballkids, performed in the tournament.\nSupposedly, for many years IW had the highest ratings of any tournament on tour. But now what the Grand Slams are doing, particularly the US Open, is requiring ballkids to be older, and I think as a result Indian Wells has increased their minimum age requirement.

Because of this relatively low max power output, the racing is a lot closer.\nThe aero bits on Formula E cars are pretty simple as well. Most of the downforce is generated by those massive rear diffusers, which don't affect the car behind the car as much as F1's huge wings, while the upper portion of the chassis doesn't really have a front or rear wing; those are replaced with small winglets. And as all the cars have a spec chassis, the main performance difference between the cars (excluding Fan Boost and Attack Mode) is the squidgy organic bit in the middle.\nThere is no denying that electric cars will become the norm in motorsport in a few decades, but as of now, they are both are the pioneers of their own areas.

A lot of the appeal is just the atmosphere of the track (the food, the people and the fact that the racers are typically local). You aren\u2019t going to find superstars here, but you are close to the action, and the speeds are fast, but not so fast that there isn\u2019t a lot of back and forth action between the cars. You can also get an easy view of the entire track. You pretty much have to experience this in person.\nThe large oval racetracks are quite different. I\u2019ve been to one NASCAR race and one Formula 1 race, so I\u2019m no expert. The aficionados with their RVs no doubt enjoy the atmosphere in those areas as well. The Formula 1 race I attended was exciting, but I only got a view of a very small section of track and the cars went by so fast I couldn\u2019t really see them. For the NASCAR race I sat really high in the stands to get a great view of the track, but even so I found the noise to be deafening. I couldn\u2019t interact with my family and friends I was there with, except during the yellow flags. Yes, you see superstars (at a great distance) and it can be exciting, but I personally found this to be the least enjoyable. I much prefer to watch these races on TV.\nRally racing is a different beast. It\u2019s probably my favorite format of all. It brings insane driving skill together with mechanics that must be able to do rapid repairs to the vehicles, and the ability to closely follow course directions. I\u2019ve attended rally races at various levels all the way up to WRC. The problem is that in person you don\u2019t get a great view of the action. You pick on spot and you see all the cars go through for your small section, but you don\u2019t get to see any of the rest of the race. On the other hand, you can get ridiculously close to the action and the teams are incredibly approachable. Coverage of these races on TV allows for a better view of the overall race, but due to the length of the race (it usually lasts 3 days) and the fact that it takes place over the course of hundreds of miles of roads, you are mostly relying on small clips and in-car cameras.\nSo where does this leave us with respect to electric cars participating in these races?\nThe primary example we have today is Formula E. It\u2019s very similar to Formula 1 in that the format is on a large race circuit. I particularly find watching Formula E on TV to be very fascinating. I like all the data and stats that are presented on screen and can see the strategy the teams use. I don\u2019t think it would be as exciting to see these races in person, but compared to watching actual Formula 1, or NASCAR, the lack of ridiculous levels of sound would be welcome.\nFor the local track type of races, I think it will be quite some time (if ever) before we see electric cars participating. I will admit that in this setting, the sound and smell is a big part of the atmosphere. So in this case, I would have to admit that electric car stock racing might not be as exciting/enjoyable.\nFinally for rally racing: with today\u2019s technology I think it is impractical to have electric vehicles competing. The distances are just too far. However, if it were technically possible to do a battery exchange or something like that after each stage or two, I actually think that electric rally racing could be even more enjoyable. Following the data in addition to the race progress would be really cool. I would really like to see this some day.", "No.", "F1 used to have refueling stops which took abot 3 seconds but on one occasion the pipe was left connected when the driver set off. Big fire so the refueling was banned..\nSo now there is no refueling and the cars do the whole race without a fuel stop.\nEV racing is only different in as much as to go the distance the driver has to swap CARS to get to the end of the race.

The prime example of this argument is the Formula E fans vs. People who dislike Formula E.\nThe people who are against FE claim the racing is boring and because the cars are electric it makes it worse because no sound, street racing and other stuff.\nMeanwhile the people who like it, myself included, like the fact that a lot of the races are not dominated by one car or team and that there\u2019s plenty of action throughout the whole event. FE was, until the last weekend, on a streak of 8 different winners in 8 races.\nThere\u2019s always two sides, because excitement is subjective.", "If you like Formula 1 racing, why not find out for yourself by watching a Formula E race?\nSee: Race Calendar | FIA Formula E", "No. One would never excite me as much as a good old muscle car or high horsepower race car.

There is something about the roar of a late model Corvette with twin turbos bringing the nose up as it takes off. Nothing like seeing an old Fox Mustang with turbos going 150 MPH or more in a quarter mile. That sweet smell of race fuel and burned rubber. The roar of the engines as they get staged and hit the trans brake, the squeal of the car leaving the burnout box. It gets your heart racing. There is something about the lack of refinement of those cars that makes them beautiful.\nHow about NASCAR? 800 hp going 175 mph in a circle, roaring and rattling your eardrums as they pass? It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s even more fun when you get the headset and listen to the drivers talking.

Except for Wilder and a 40 year old Wlad Klitchiko who has Fury beat that could shine the shoes of the opponents that Ali faced and beat? Lennox Lewis would be a good match.

This debate is singled out for Heavyweights, so, leaving aside the \u2018great white hopes\u2019 of the past, i.e., Dempsey, Marciano et al, I would like to say:\nHave you forgotten Vladimir and Vitali Klitschko? Just because they aren\u2019t from the USA doesn\u2019t mean they fail to qualify. Of course, they were more than just \u2018great white hopes\u2019 because they actually achieved; winning multiple World Titles between them. Despite Vladimir\u2019s longevity in the heavyweight ranks and his overall fight record, I recognise Vitali as the better fighter. Far stronger chin and tighter fighting ability, as he showed against Lennox Lewis (albeit in Lewis\u2019 retirement fight).\nAnd the final argument on this is Tyson Fury. The hunt for the \u2018Great White Hope\u2019 is finally over. He\u2019s just not American. Sorry guys", "This is a term that time needs to pass by!

When he lost briefly to a white swede ( Ingemar Johansson) I b still was a fan of Floyd because he was American. Being from Kentucky I of course was a fan of Muhammad Ali.The trouble with white hopes n is it brings up bad racial memories where blacks were denied opportunities they should have had ( although boxing has better qualifications than many other sports like baseball)", "Tommy Morrison, unfortunately he succumbed to drugs and HIV, he was up to fight Tyson.", "The last \u201cGreat White Hope\u201d was Gerry Cooney in 1982. Just for purposes of review, a \u201cgreat white hope\u201d is when most of the White boxing fans tire of having a Black heavyweight champion of hope for someone White to come along and beat him. The first time it happened was back when Jack Johnson was the heavyweight champion; he was the first Black heavyweight champion in fact. He was a great one, too. But he was too cocky for the taste of many White boxing fans. Since there was no active White heavweight fighter around who stood a chance to beat Johnson at the time, they talked a retired White heavyweight champion out of retirement - Jim Jeffries. Jeffries was a great champion who had retired undefeated. He had been out of boxing for six years, and was happy on his alfalfa farm, but there were too many who goaded him into feeling obligated to return to boxing and \u201ctake back\u201d the title from the Black champion for the sake of America.\nIn 1910, Johnson easily beat Jeffries in humiliating fashion. Jeffries was way out of shape, having to lose 100 pounds. Johnson knocked down Jeffries twice - something which had never been done - before Jeffries\u2019 corner threw in the towel in the 15th round. The result led to race riots all over America. Twenty-three Blacks and 2 Whites reportedly died. It would be five years before another \u201cGreat White Hope\u201d, Jess Willard, finally beat Johnson in 1915. Twenty-two years would pass before America would have another Black heavyweight boxing champion, that being the popular Joe Louis, who hold the title for the next 12 years. From 1952 - 1956 the great Rock Marciano was a White heavyweight boxing champion but he was not a \u201cGreat White Hope\u201d since he had no great Black opponent to unseat.\nIn 1956, Floyd Patterson, who was Black, won the heavyweight title and briefly lost it in 1960 to Ingemar Johansson, who was White, but who was from Sweden. Patterson would later win back the title, and no one seriously saw Johansson as a \u201cGreat White Hope.\u201d Beginning in 1960, Black men would hold the heavyweight box title for the next 33 years, when Tommy Morrison won and briefly held the WBO heavyweight box ing title. However, Tommy was not a \u201cGreat White Hope.\u201d There was a never an undisputed Black champion that the general White public wanted him to beat.\nThat is why my answer for the last \u201cGreat White Hope\u201d was Gentleman Gerry Cooney. In 1982 the heavyweight champion was Larry Holmes. He was a great undefeated champion at the time. One disadvantage for Holmes was the fact that he followed Muhammad Ali as the champion. He was a great fighter but he was not Ali, and his attempts at trying to be another Ali as a person seemed to always fall flat. The American press had a very contentious relationship with him, and, as a result, he always got bad press, regardless of how great he was. In comes Gerry Cooney, an attractive White, young (24), undefeated power puncher, who had knocked out Ken Norton and Ron Lyle in the first round and stopped Jimmy Young in four rounds.\nCooney vs. Holmes was a boxing promoter\u2019s dream, and Don King got there first. He may have even began saying what everybody was thinking: Gerry was the \u201cGreat White Hope.\u201d But Cooney\u2019s camp stirred the pot, too, stating that Gerry was \u201cnot the White man but the right man.\u201d The commercial market ate it up. When a fight date was set, Cooney got premium shaving cream TV commercials as well as other perks. He got favorable publicity. His purse was equal to that of Holmes, $10 million, although there was no reason for it. On the night of the fight, a century of boxing tradition was broken by introducing the champion (Holmes) first and the challenger (Cooney) last. The race card was in the atmosphere at many closed circuit locations, if not at the fight itself.\nIn the actual fight, Cooney briefly hit the canvas in the second round. After that he fought well, but he kept throwing punches below Holmes\u2019 belt. (Holmes is reported to have urinated blood after the fight). The referee never warned Gerry for low punches. Outside of that, Cooney fought a good fight, but Holmes fought a great fight. By the late rounds, Holmes was engaged in target practice with his hard right hands. The referee wisely stopped the fight in the 13th round, as it looked like Cooney was ready to go down.\nGerry did not fight for two years after that. He had the makings of a great champion but some thought that he was brought along too fast. Gerry would eventually say that his handlers had no interest in developing him as a fighter. Gerry never embraced the \u201cGreat White Hope\u201d mantle. Like Jeffries, it was thrust upon him by people who had their own agenda. He is now co-host of a boxing radio show and does a great job. Cooney is quite the humble man. He and Holmes are great friends now. I have heard both of them in public gatherings refuse to criticize the other, saying \u201cWe\u2019re friends now.\u201d\nNow rated as one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time, Holmes would later say that his fight with Cooney was one of the toughest he ever had. This was one time the dark side didn\u2019t win. Holmes and Cooney have the greatest respect and admiration for each other because of that fight.", "I hate the term \u201cgreat white hope\u201d because of what it meant historically, and the racist overtones that persist to this day.\nHaving said that, in terms of American boxing, my friend Keith Scott is right as usual, and the last two \u201cgreat white hopes\u201d were Gerry Cooney and Tommy Morrison. I will add a third and earlier white hope though, whose name has faded with the mists of time, Duane Bobick.\nCREDIT PICTURE JO SPORTS\nIn chronological order:\nDuane Bobick\nDuane Bobick, born on August 24, 1950, was at one time a genuine contender for the heavyweight championship. As an amateur he won the gold medal at the 1971 Pan American Games and fought at the 1972 Olympics. 6\u20323\u2033 with an 82 inch reach, and weighing 215 pounds, he knocked out Mike Weaver in the amateurs, and outpointed Larry Holmes. He thought he would win a Gold Medal in the Olympics in 1972, but the great Cuban heavyweight Teofilo Stevenson stopped him in a dead even fight in the 3rd round.\nOn the surface, his amateur record, 93\u201310, with 60 knockouts, and victories over Mike Weaver and Larry Holmes, gave hope of a coming champion. But I remember at the time thinking about his two losses by knockout in the amateurs to Ron Lyle, one of which had him unconscious in the ring for over five minutes, and believing those were a harbinger of problems for him in the pros.\nWith some fanfare, Bobick turned professional in 1973, having decided to devote himself to boxing. He trained into superb shape, and managed to convince Joe Frazier to train and manage him.\nBy 1975, he had managed victories over Mike Weaver, and #10 contender Larry Middleton, and serious buzz had begun about his prospects. 1976 saw him beat fringe contender Chuck Wepner, and rise to #4 contender. In early 1977, he rose to the #3 contender. That was the height of his career.\nFrazier had arranged a tenative agreement for him to fight Muhammad Ali for the title in 1976, but it had fallen through, and so instead, Joe arranged for him to fight his old friend Ken Norton, who after George Foreman retirement, was ranked #1 in the world. If he beat Norton, he got a shot at the title, and the great white hope thing was in full bloom.\nBut the Norton fight was the end of the great white hope status for Duane Bobick and the end of any serious hope of a title. He was 38\u20130 with 32 knockouts that day in May in 1977 when he met Ken Norton in Madison Square Garden. A swarmer, Bobick was, like his trainer Joe Frazier, slow to warm up. He never got the chance to warm up against Norton. 58 seconds into the first round the referee stopped the fight after a devastating overhand right from Norton sent Bobick reeling across the ring, and a follow up hit him in the Adam\u2019s apple. Up at 9, he was obviously in no shape to continue, and the referee stopped the fight.\nBobick was done as a serious contender, though he ranked #5 in 1978, a knockout at the hands of Kallie Knoetze finished him completely as a contender. Losses by knockout to rising star John Tate and journeyman George Chaplain sent him into retirement.\nBobick returned to his home in Minnesota and worked in paper mills before an industrial accident nearly killed him in 1997. Both his arms were caught and crushed between huge paper rolls being rotated in the paper mill. He only barely avoided amputation after complex surgery to re-attach muscles and tendons and repair massive skin and bone trauma. After that he went into coaching and public speaking, using his celebrity to help others. In November 2006, Bobick was elected as a city councilman.\nUnfortunately, as with so many, pugilistic dementia ended Bobick\u2019s public life. Bobick suffers from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and has to be cared for full-time by his wife.\nGerry Cooney\nAbout the time Duane Bobick retired in 1979, the next great white hope, Gerry Cooney, had entered the rankings at #9 contender.\nGerald Arthur Cooney was born on August 4, 1956, six years after Bobick, is best remembered for his title challenge to Larry Holmes in 1982, though he fought again for a title in 1987.\nWinning the New York Golden Gloves, the 6\u20326\u2033 Cooney was 55\u20133 as an amateur, and rose quickly in the paid ranks when he turned professional in 1977, entering the top ten two years later. With an 81 inch reach, and a devastating left hook, Cooney was 25\u20130 by 1982, with 23 knockouts, when he challenged Larry Holmes for the WBC heavyweight championship.\nCooney had knocked out Ron Lyle in the first round in 1980, and stopped the always tough Jimmy Young with a TKO. In 1981 Cooney knocked out Ken Norton, and the stage was set for him to meet Holmes.\nRon Lyle and Ken Norton were both powerful and skilled heavyweights, but both were destroyed in the 1st round by Cooney in amazing displays of punching power. There is an argument today that both men were past their prime in these contests but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that these two, normally very durable and tough heavyweights, were totally destroyed.\nMany boxing writers, and much of the public, was so amazed by his performances against Lyle and Norton that they predicted he would just walk into the ring and knock Holmes out the same way. Holmes however, had other ideas and was not in the least bit concerned about Cooney, saying he would expose him in the ring as a pretender.\nThe racial hype prior to the fight was truly ugly. Cooney\u2019s management milked the great white hope theme for all it was worth. A telephone line was set up in Cooney\u2019s dressing room, so that President Ronald Reagan could wish him good luck. Holmes was ignored. Then, just prior to the opening bell, Holmes, against all boxing tradition, was introduced first despite being the defending champion.\nBut the disrespect enraged Holmes, and he made Cooney pay for it. Holmes had Cooney reeling around the ring in the first round, and knocked him down in the second, but the big man was game, and fought on, landing some terrific shots on Holmes. Larry would tell Ring in later years \u201c\u201cGerry was much better than I thought he was and I tell him that to this day, when he fought Kenny Norton, I didn\u2019t think he was going to win that fight but he took Kenny out in a few seconds\u2026\u201d\nCooney was completely exhausted by Round 13, and was hit by Holmes with a brutal series of head shots, preceded by a right lead. Cooney fell into the ropes and his trainer, Victor Valle, entered the ring to rescue Cooney, forcing referee Mills Lane to end the fight. Incredibly, if Cooney hadn\u2019t had three points deducted for low blows, two judges would have had the challenger ahead after 12 rounds.\nThat was the end for Cooney as a serious title contender, though he would fight Mike Spinks for the title in 1987, in one of Spinks two title defenses. KO\u2019s by Spinks, he was KO\u2019s again by the returning Old George Foreman and retired.\nThe highest Cooney ever rose in the rankings was #2 in 1980 and 1981.\nIronically, he and Holmes became friends in later years, and remain so to this day.\nCooney\u2019s after boxing life is happier than Bobick\u2019s. Cooney is deeply involved in J.A.B., the first union for boxers, and has worked as an analyst for fights. He lives with his wife and two of their children in New Jersey.\nOur last great white hope is Tommy Morrison\nTommy Morrison's life and death was - and is - a cautionary tale, a tragedy, a tragedy of wasted talent, wasted time, and a wasted life.\nBorn in 1969, 13 years after Gerry Cooney, and a distant relative of John Wayne\u2019s, for a time, the \u201cDuke,\u201d as Morrison was known, was considered a genuine contender.\nMorrison claimed an amateur record of 222-20, and had steadily improved his skills as an amateur. He had first rate fundamental skills, according to Lennox Lewis, and others. What he did not have were the \"three D's\" as Manny Steward used to say, discipline, direction, and devotion to his craft. Tommy made the post-Rooney Tyson look like a piker for partying. Tommy partied 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, and it not only stunted and eventually stopped his career, it also killed him.\nA horde of writers, other fighters, Morrison\u2019s family, and his manager, Bill Cayton, were constantly exasperated by Tommy's devotion to women, drink and drugs. Morrison's life, and his complete lack of professionalism, and party lifestyle were detailed religiously in \"The Tommy \"The Duke\" Morrison Story\" by Charles H. Hood.\nHood provides riveting details from Tommy Morrison's wife, and grandparents, parents, brothers and sister. Hood\u2019s biography of Tommy Morrison is based upon personal interviews with Dawn Morrison Brady, her detailed journal entries that spanned over 13 years, and early life tales as told by Tommy\u2019s grandparents, parents, brothers and sister.\nAs his mother wryly said, \"nobody could ever tell Tommy anything. He lived the way he wanted, and it killed him.\" Bill Cayton said \"he could have been great...\"\nGeorge Foreman said of Morrison, \"\u201cHe was a good puncher, he could hit, and he moved his head well,\u201d Foreman said. \u201cHe had a good style. I thought he\u2019d have a great career.\u201d\nLennox Lewis, who defeated Morrison, was quick to praise him, calling him \"one of the hardest punchers I ever met.\" Lewis also said, \"he has talent, he doesn't have discipline,\" and he is not the only fighter who says it. Ray Mercer, one of three men who beat Morrison, claimed that Morrison hit harder than Lennox Lewis, \"but he doesn't train,\" said Mercer, \"and in this business it isn't enough to hit hard or have talent, you have to use it and work on it.\"\nAnd Tommy did not work on it, or anything, according to his manager and family, except partying.\nMorrison himself said repeatedly that his \"sexually promiscuous lifestyle, along with gun and drug crimes,\" (his words), resulting in jail and prison time, sabotaged what might have been a far brighter career. When he retired the first time, after the HIV finding in Nevada, Morrison said at a news conference he'd never fight again, blaming his plight on a \"permissive, fast and reckless lifestyle.''\nHis lifestyle never changed, though, even when he stepped away from the ring.\nMorrison didn't train, he drank, he took drugs, he slept with every woman he could find, and he got HIV and refused to treat it. At one point in 1996 Morrison was married to two women at the same time, Dawn Freeman and Dawn Gilbert, while having encounters with hundreds more. (Morrison claimed he beat Wilt Chamberlain's record of sleeping with 20,000 women, and said he could even remember some of them).\nStardom, Foreman said \u201ccan be tough. One day, no one pays you any attention. The next, you\u2019re this good-looking, popular guy that everyone wants a piece of and your whole world explodes. And if you\u2019re not ready for it, it can take you on a ride that takes you quicker than you want to the last day of your life.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know much about his personal life, and didn\u2019t get into it,\u201d Foreman said. But he knew that Tommy's personal life sabatoged his talent, and ruined his career.\nAnd the saddest part was, Tommy was basically a good guy. George Foreman recalled how, in a pre-fight press conference, Morrison took Foreman\u2019s words and converted them to rib the former heavyweight champion about his expanding waistline. \u201cThe one thing about George is that he\u2019s got two chins, so you\u2019re not sure which one to hit,\u201d Morrison said.\nSaid Foreman: \u201cI thought that was so funny, we rehearsed it so we could use the same exchange at the next day\u2019s press conference. The thing about Tommy was he was just a good guy.\u201d\nMorrison was proud he was a distant relative of John Wayne. But the problem was he lived his whole life like he was in the Wild West. His mother gave him his first tattoo. And his father gave him his first woman -- at a strip club when Tommy was 14.\nThey entered him, as an eighth-grader, in \"tough man\" contests. In other words, his parents essentially signed him up for bar fights. That's how he made his name. That and setting fire to his high school football field when he was cut from the team.\nTommy well and truly lost his mind after he contacted HIV. It was a February morning in 1996, shortly after signing a $38.5 million new contract, and he was 27, when he found out he had HIV. He freely and happily admitted later that after a talk with Magic Johnson, who told him the key was listen to his doctor's, that he did the opposite. \"I partied away!\" said Morrison.\nHis family assumed he contracted HIV from a dirty steroid needle, but no one knows for sure, because Tommy declined to talk about it, ever. Before the turn of the new millennium, he bought a cave, (yes, a cave), convinced that the world was coming to an end at the stroke of midnight on Jan. 1, 2000. That's where he slept on Dec. 31, 1999. Morrison also claimed that HIV was a conspiracy by the government.\nIn August 2013, Morrison's mother told ESPN: Serving sports fans. Anytime. Anywhere.\nthat her son had full-blown AIDS. \"He's too far gone,\" she said. \"He's in the end stages. That's it.\"\nTommy Morrison died on September 1, 2013, at a hospital in Omaha, Nebraska. According to his death certificate, he died from cardiac arrest stemming from a blood infection known as Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Septicemia, which unfortunately is a common cause of death in HIV-infected patients.\nTommy Morrison entered the rankings at #9 in 1993, and remained #9 in 1994. He was unranked from 1995 on, for all his knockouts. He ended his career 48\u20133 with 42 KO\u2019s.\nTalent is not enough. In any field, and especially in boxing, talent has be, as Mayweather says, polished and developed. Tommy had an abundance of talent. He had no intention of, and never did, polish and develop it. He discovered the joys of stardom, and partying, and that was that.\nCREDITS:\nRING for contender rankings\nBoxrec for statistics\nRing interview on Holmes-Cooney Larry Holmes: Gerry Cooney was \u2018a helluva fighter\u2019 - The Ring\nESPN \u201cMorrison's wild ride ended by denial\u201d by Tom Friend Morrison's wild ride ended by denial\nGoing the Distance : The Ken Norton Story by Ken Norton\nLarry Holmes: Against the Odds by Larry Holmes\nThe Tommy \"The Duke\" Morrison Story by Charles H.

He got a title shot at Larry Holmes in 1982. It\u2019s disgusting now to think that even in the 1980\u2019s a fight had racial overtones but it did. A special phone was installed in Cooney\u2019s dressing room so President Reagan could call him and congratiulate him if he won. No such phone was put in Holmes\u2019 dressing room. Holmes dropped him in the 2nd round, but he got up and gave Holmes a tough fight. It was stopped in the 13th round-Holmes had floored Cooney again and was battering him. Cooney\u2019s manager jumped into the ring and had the referee stop it. Holmes won by TKO. In the \u201890\u2019s there was Tommy Morrison-John Wayne\u2019s grandson.

He beat James Tillis, Pinklon Thomas, Carl Williams, Razor Ruddock and got a questionable decision over George Foreman. He was also KO\u2019d by Ray Mercer, Michael Bentt and Lennox Lewis.

It also didn\u2019t hurt that he was the great-grandnephew of the legendary actor John Wayne (whose birthname was Marion Morrison)! So, Morrison was popular for many reasons and subsequently garnered much media attention because of it.\nSure, Tommy had his weaknesses as a fighter, most notably a less-than-reliable chin and limited stamina, issues which cost him in several fights, most notably in his losses to Ray Mercer and Michael Bentt. But technically, Morrison was sound: he had excellent boxing fundamentals, threw powerful, crisp combinations, and simply knew how to fight \u2014 but his weaknesses prevented him from ever reaching the top, although he came close.\nFurthermore, Morrison\u2019s personal life was often chaotic, one replete with drug and alcohol problems, rampant sexual promiscuity, and a few brief stints in jail/prison. And ultimately, Morrison succumbed to his personal demons and died at a very young age (44) from what is believed to be AIDS-related complications.\nBut for several years during the 1990s, Morrison was a key player in the heavyweight division, a fighter who added a lot of excitement to the game!", "Tommy Morrison, by a long shot. The answer will be simple and straight. Boxing career record: 48 wins 42 wins by TKO 3 loses 1 draw. He was, indeed, a great boxer and the last \u201dgreat white hope\u201d. His only losses we're to three of the best fighters the boxing world had seen: Lennox Lewis and Ray Mercer. He also lost to Michael Bennett who wasn't as the fighter Tommy Morrison. The bout stood as an upset.", "Probably Gerry Cooney, who was billed as such by Don King when he fought Larry Holmes for the heavyweight title in 1982. Cooney came along at a time when the world heavyweight champion had been Black for many years. There were several \u201cgreat white hopes\u201d before Cooney, and one of them, Jerry Quarry, even has it on his tombstone. Quarry and some of the others came close, but never won a recognized belt.\nThe Holmes-Cooney fight was punctuated with some disgusting racist statements and behavior, much of it fueled by King himself to make more money. The two fighters themselves wanted nothing to do with this, although I am certain Holmes resented how easily Cooney became the top contender, when Holmes had struggled for years to get his shot. But when Holmes faced him in the ring, all he said was \u201clet\u2019s have a good fight.\u201d Cooney was outclassed, but fought a courageous fight before being stopped in the 13th round. He and Holmes are close friends today, as many great boxing rivals have become after their ring days ended.\nA decade later, I heard the term used in connection with Tommy Morrison, who was the \u201cbad guy\u201d in one of the Rocky movies and was also a real heavyweight boxer. Morrison did win the WBO title, but at a time when it wasn\u2019t considered a \u201cmajor\u201d belt. This was also in a time when the matter of the race of the world heavyweight champion had ceased being such an issue. Andrew Golota, in one of his attempts to win a title, was victimized by a poor decision and there was no more outrage than there is when a minority fighter gets ripped off.\nNo one would use this silly term today. Since the heyday of the Klitschko brothers, who started becoming well known just a few years after Morrison, there has always been at least one White heavyweight champion for many years, and between them and Tyson Fury, they haven\u2019t all been \u201cpaper champions,\u201d either.\nhttps://boxrec.com/media/index.php/White_Hope", "Jesse Willard", "Probably Joe Calzaghe", "Don king called Gerry Cooney the last \u201cGreat White Hope.\u201d"], "topic_list": ["Boxing Greats", "Boxers (sport)", "Boxing (sport)", "Fighting", "Professional Sports", "Sports", "History"], "view_list": [85, 125, 137, 307, 275, 3, 351, 0, 18, 899, 325, 12, 10, 7, 339, 0, 0, 3, 2, 3], "create_time": "Apr 18, 2020", "no_of_follower": 7, "question_author": "Brad Oxler", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 2, 3, 6, 0, 3, 0, 0, 13, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "question_title": "Who was the last \"great white hope\" in boxing?", "respond_collected": 20, "no_of_view": "20,064", "name_list": ["Eloy Haughton", "Jerry Allen", "Mohan Padake", "James Duggan", "Johnny Walker", "WR Mann", "Ralph Thomas", "John McGlothlin", "Robert Quam", "Keith Scott", "Matt Prieto", "Mark Leland", "Brian A Mellen", "Jack Beddows", "Jason Anthony", "Jonathan Moore", "John Cate", "Joe Varga", "Biniam Dina", "John P.

As a Serbian you well know that the status of \u201ccountry\u201d is a fluid one that changes over the years. For example take Russia. For a long time it competed internationally as part of the Soviet Union - now it is an independent country.\nWhat period of time are we talking about. The last 5 years, 10 years,\nWhat is a satisfactory measure of success. Number of school children enrolled in formal sport activity? The number of FIFA World Cup\u2019s the nation has won?\nThere are probably more issues than I have listed but you get the idea?\nSo here is what I decided to measure:\nThe number of medals (regardless of colour) that each country has won in the modern Olympic Games divided by the 100,000th of the population.\nI used the data from these two Wikipedia websites:\nAll-time Olympic Games medal table - Wikipedia\nList of countries and dependencies by population - Wikipedia\nI used MS Excel to do the calculation.\nHere is what I found:\nThe most successful country is Norway with an index of 9.7 medals per 100,000 population\nSerbia has an index of 0.2 (This is a middle of the pack ranking).\nMy top countries in order of success were Norway, Sweden, Bahamas, Austria, Australia, Belgium, Great Britain, Canada, France , Italy, Germany, Belarus, United States, Poland, South Korea, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Japan, Russia\nNow it is at this point in the answer that I have to confess that I did not complete all the countries tabulations because I ran out of time and I also think that it is something anyone can do for themselves. So I leave it to others to troll through the data and see if there is a country that can beat Norway\u2019s index. There may be one of the smaller countries that has won a few medals and thus gained a high index.\nAs I said at the beginning there are issues with whatever way you tackle this question. One that hasn\u2019t been mentioned already is that it is teams and not exactly nations that compete at the OG - for the majority they are synonymous but issues with for example Russia means that they have probably been underrated by my methodology.\nYou may wonder why Norway and Sweden are at the top of this list.

The Ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the Test series. If the test series is drawn, the team that currently holds the Ashes retains the trophy. It is traditionally of five Tests, hosted in turn by England and Australia at least once every two years.\nThe match : It\u2019s 1882 and on their tour to England that year the Australians played just one Test, at the Oval in London. England lost final 4 wickets for just 7 runs while chasing 85 runs for victory and fell 8 runs short. An astonished Oval crowd fell silent, struggling to believe that England could possibly have lost to a colony on home soil.\nThis is Australia\u2019s first Test win on English soil. And then The term \u201cAshes\u201doriginated in a mock notice published in a British newspaper, The Sporting Times. It stated that English cricket had died, and \"the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\".\nThe reason for such outrage by British newspaper being England was in a winning position and lost from an impossible position.\nThe Ashes urn is a small urn made of terracotta and standing 10.5 cm high, believed to contain the ashes of a burnt cricket bail.

It is 2005 Ashes series in England and the Ashes were held with Australia as they were the recent victors.\nEngland have not lost a Test series at home to their arch-rivals since 2001. However, England didn\u2019t win Ashes series for nearly 19 years. To start of, England lost the first Test at Lord's by 239 runs. From here, it seemed impossible to win the Test Series and get back the famous urn back to home. Good news follows for second test, Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath was ruled out of the second Test at Edgbaston after treading on a ball during practice on the morning of the match.\nEngland took charge, Flintoff starred with both and ball and Australia were dead at 175-8, chasing 282 for victory, a home win looked assured. However, Australia being Australia came back with Brett lee adding useful runs along with Shane Warne and unlikely Kasprowicz. England held their nerve and Steve Harmison dismissed Michael Kasprowicz to give England victory by a mere two runs.\nA pic that says a lot about cricket being Gentlemen game and the sportsmanship spirit. Flintoff later told \u201d\u201cI was taught as a kid always respect the opposition first and celebrate after, which I did. I went over to Brett Lee and shook his hand and there\u2019s that picture, where I whisper in his ear: \u2018It\u2019s 1-1, son.\u2019\u201d\nThe third Test was drawn and England survived a brilliant four-wicket burst from leg-spin great Shane Warne to win the fourth Test at Trent Bridge. It\u2019s 2\u20131 now in favour of England. Australia still have the chance to retain the Ashes if they win the final test by leveling the series (2\u20132) and England were in danger of defeat on the last day at the Oval until Kevin Pietersen's breathtaking 158 and a fine fifty from Ashes Giles rescued them following a top-order collapse.\nFinally, England retain the Ashes, A summer that will never be forgotten.\nA special mention to 1981: Botham's Ashes, rarely has one man done as much to win an Ashes as Ian Botham in 1981.\n1948: Australia's 'Invincibles' when Don Bradman captained Australia and won it 4\u20130 comprehensively.\n1974/5: Lillee and Thomson, when the speed guns run riot against English batting line up to win the series 4\u20131.\n1932/33: 'Bodyline', The most controversial Ashes series of them all, which saw batsmen having to defend themselves rather than their stumps and rules of cricket needed a change. It worked to the extent England won the Ashes 4-1, was condemned as \"unsporting\" by Australian officials.\nIn total, there have been 71 Ashes series: Australia have won 33, England 32 and six series have been drawn and Australia currently holds the trophy.", "The Ashes is a Test Cricket series played between England and Australia. The Ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the Test series. If the test series is drawn, the team that currently holds the Ashes retains the trophy.

The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and \"the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\".\nThe mythical ashes immediately became associated with the 1882\u201383 series played in Australia, before which the English captain Ivo Bligh\nhad vowed to \"regain those ashes\".

He is disabled me, though he seems to like to insult everyones else intelligence. , . really, I only have seen highlights of the fight. From what I know, perhaps Mike won a round, and I do believe that Lewis had a point deducted at one time. Mike when interviewed at one time, I remember reading that he said that Rooney was not this great trainer that others feel. As many have suggested, there are really no great trainers today. Emanuel Stewart might have ben, in what he did with Lewis and Wlad. After Manny die,d Wlad seemed not to be the same. However, I think early in his career, I always remember denis Andries who Steart was training, the n he fought Jeff Harding of Austraia in the first fight, when he got stopped in the 12th. He was shocked to learn all he had to do was keep standing of the rest of the fight,. My corner he basically said told him he was behind on points. What could Stewart have done to maybe keep Hearns from getting stopped by Lenoard, and becoming the undisputed Welter weight champ at the time. Also I despite now Hearns talking about his hands I guess in the fight with Hagler, he also at the time sort of blacked Stewart for having him run in some sand dunes or something, and wear out his legs. Perhaps the greatest trainers were a Charlie Goldman, who trained Marciano, and really was his teacher. I can\u2019t think of anyone who would say that Rocky Maricano would have been heavyweight champ. Tyson's big fall though was the loss of Cus Damato, and Jacobs. A good manager. After that death, that started the downward descent for Mike. Also success too early for Mike was another problem I think, the accolades. Look at Wilfredo Benetiz, a world Jr welter weight champ at 17. Washed up at 25. I\u2019m 63 now, I don\u2019t even think I am so mature, but Mike getting success so early? Archie Moore I remember said that though it might have been wrong that he did not get a title shot until his late 30\u2019s, as I remember, said that time it took might have also built character. I cannot also forget though= how the media really hounded Tyson, really bad people as Donald would probably say. Mikes greatness as a person though, is that through all this, he seems to have come back as a person, and be a wiser man. Maybe very parallel to Jake Lamota, in what Jake said he had to do. Mike Tyson\u2019s journey still continues on to be a champion as a man. Wish him all the best.", "This fight being 18 yrs ago Lewis knocked out Tyson in the 8th round. Tyson would have DESTROYED Lennox Lewis in his prime, but by the time they fought Tyson had lost most of his God given talents, living life recklessly and basically was fighting for money and no longer for the love of his sport. Regardless of the way Tyson left the sport of boxing, he will go down in history as one of the greatest heavyweight boxers in the World.", "Ok, seeing as no one is actually answering the question (with the exception ofJason Anthony), I'll put in my analysis.\nCoincidentally, I rewatched the entire fight just last week and so it's fresh in the mind.\nRound 1\nAs Jason Anthony has stated, Tyson took the first round. And this was not due to any quality punches landed or any dominance, but rather because Mike Tyson came off the blocks quicker than Lewis, was busier and more aggressive. Emanuel Steward, Lewis's trainer, would shout at him throughout the fight to box on the outside, use the jab and 'stay well away from that *********! Don't get into an exchange!\u201d. It's therefore likely that Lewis used the first round to cautiously evaluate his rival.\nRound 2\nMike Tyson came out again trying to replicate the first round performance. But the Briton was wiser now, and started to clinch Tyson and lean his 250lb+ weight on the shorter man every time Tyson tried to come on the inside. Tyson grew visibly frustrated as he could neither land his main weapon - the left hook - nor get to his favoured mid-range distance without being clinched. Lewis bagged that round.\nRounds 3\u20137\nHaving found a template that worked, Lewis stuck to it, and also began to find a home for his straight right to Tyson's head. Due to Tyson still trying to land the left hook, there was no protection at all on his left side as Lennox Lewis began to land one powerful right after another. I was amazed at the strength of Tyson's chin!\nBut the referee did not protect Tyson from Lewis's constant holding and leaning and despite a few ineffective warnings did not deduct any points.\nTyson's corner were imploring him to let his hands go and swarm the Englishman, but he did not have the agility of his earlier years to dart in and out of range. The trainer warned him that he would stop the fight if the punishment continued. Emanuel Steward, meanwhile, instructed Lewis to stick to his guns and not get drawn into a firefight.\nHowever, by this stage the American posed only a limited threat. Frustrated by his inability to land the left hook, he appeared to switch in mid fight to a stance favouring the right hook, and indeed he landed a powerful right on Lewis's left jaw in one of the middle rounds. But Lewis looked quite unharmed.\nTyson had swelling above both eyes by this point.\nLewis won all rounds from 3 to 7.\nTyson found his left hook ineffective against Lewis\nLewis landed the straight right any time he wanted to\nRound 8\nThe coup de gr\u00e2ce came in the eighth round by predictable means.\nTyson looked confused, inept and without a viable war strategy. Lewis was still patient with his jab and continued to land the powerful straight right.\nAnd it was one of these blows that caught Tyson flush and sent him crashing to the canvass to end one of the the most embarrassingly one sided bouts of world championship heavyweight boxing.", "That was so long ago but I believe I did give him one or two rounds but I had Lewis comfortably ahead when I believe he finally knocked Tyson out I think the 8th round", "lennox beat the shit out of mike.

Fanboys get so wrapped up in the persona of this mythic not so existent Champion they bend reality make excuses without number, and view his Boxing career thru very rose colored glasses.The true hard to realize facts are that Iron Mike was always going to have problems with two kinds of fighter the big strong heavyweight with a jab( Lewis and Douglas) and the brutal infighter( Holyfield, Joe Frazier) who kept him on inside and just roughed him up The Cus D\u2019Amato Peek a Boo was not a defensive masterpiece by a genius( it was for flawed Heavyweights like Patterson and Tyson, Patterson weak chin, Tyson short no reach) Reason Tyson starting loosing wasn\u2019t lack of Rooney it was lack of Training to be able to use such a high energy system", "As usual with the never was a boxing coach, he gave you never was fantasies instead of facts. Today it is Mike Tyson's turn to get lied about.\nMike Tyson did not duck Lennox Lewis for 10 years. While Lennox's size, fundamentals, sound jab and power punching would have always been problematic, it would have been a much closer, if not different, fight had they met early in their careers - a fact Lewis cheerfully acknowledges!\nFirst of all, Mike was best at a fighting weight of around 215. He came into the Lewis fight at 234, the heaviest of his career, and his speed, and movement, were gone. Once a fabulously conditioned volume punching speed demon, Mike was a relatively slow, fat, one shot puncher.\nA young Rooney-trained Tyson, at 215, would have been a completely different fighter, and Lewis acknowledged that.\nLennox said, \"Mike at the age of 19 ruled the world, but like a fine wine, I came along later on and now I'm the ruling man.\"\nTyson, although a year younger than Lewis, began boxing professionally 4 years earlier in 1985. Lewis, who won a Gold Medal in the 1988 Olympics, started in 1989.\nBut what if Lewis had gone pro in 1985 or so, instead of maturing and waiting for the Olympics? He would have been ready for Mike by 1989, when Tyson was at the peak of his career, when he - as Mike said - \"I was the best I ever was, or would be, when I faced Mike Spinks.\"\nEmmanuel Steward, who trained Lennox Lewis after his stunning KO defeat by Oliver McCall, who Steward had trained for that fight, said he believed a prime Lewis still could have defeated a prime Tyson - but he acknowledged prime Mike's speed and intensity. He felt Lewis's sheer size and power would have still triumphed - but it would not have been an easy fight.\nWhen the never was says says the fight took over 10 years to put together because Mike knew he would lose, that is simply not so. Unfortunately, as usual, the never was a coach also never checked a thing in boxing history.\nLennox did not start boxing as a professional until over 4 years and 3 months later than Tyson, despite being a year older. Their careers, because of Lewis's far later start, and Mike forced exile while he was in prison, simply did not overlap for most of their respective careers, and by the time they did, Mike was a very fat shadow of the old Iron Mike.\nLewis was not ready for a top contender until late in 1992, when he met Razor Ruddock. That takes another three years out of their fighting during the same period. Mike was out of boxing while in prison, which further reduces the time. Mike not return until 1995, and he was in no shape to face Lewis just returning from 4 years off.\nMike was never really Mike again after he returned from prison. He was not even in good fighting form of any kind - and certainly absolutely nothing resembling what he had been in his prime. But he had gotten in at least enough shape to fight by 1997 when he faced Holyfield, and promptly lost twice. Mike then took another year and a half off, and that left only 3 years before he faced Lewis.\nTo say Mike ducked Lewis or did not want to make the fight with Lewis for a decade is simply ignoring reality. Mike was out of boxing for almost 6 years out of the ten from 1992, when Lewis became a top contender, and when they met in 2002!\nEmmanuel Steward, one of history's great trainers, believed that Lewis was always too big, too strong, for Tyson. But he also acknowledged that a young, Rooney trained Tyson had been a different, focused, fabulously in shape, speed and intensity driven champion. Lewis said it best, at 19 and for three years, Mike was King, but Lennox came along later, and became the Man.\nAnd those are the real facts, not never was alternate reality ones!", "I gave Tyson the first round. He came out with a lot of energy and landed a few decent punches and forced the action. Lewis spent most of the round retreating and tying Tyson up \u2014 although Lewis landed a few nice uppercuts in the round. But Tyson did more work in the first.\nBut overall, Lewis controlled the fight, as Tyson was so far past his best at that point that he didn\u2019t offer much to Lewis, who was still at or near the top of his game.\nHad that been 1988 Tyson in there, however, the fight would have been very different. I\u2019d favor that version of Tyson over any version of Lewis, but Lewis would be a live threat.", "No\u2026\nThat was a one-sided fight from the opening bell. Lewis was too big and strong for Mike. LL went 6\u20325\u2033 X 250 for that fight. Mike was 5\u203211 X 234. Most heavyweights tend to add muscle to their frame as they get into their 30\u2019s.\nMike is no dummy, and that\u2019s the reason Lewis-Tyson took more than 10 years to put together.. It was the richest heavyweight fight ever made until recently.\nI believe Mike always knew what was likely to happen when they clashed. After all, Lewis blew away Razor Ruddock\u2014a guy who went the distance with Mike.\nMike did not want a rematch with Lewis. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get beat up again.\u201d", "Sloppy.

The problem was after his first press conference, he was known to be very geeky and analytical with his tactics in putting the best position available. After that, some of the Philly fans were very much skeptical about this guy and seem very worried. Doesn\u2019t seem right, but whatever. Opening Day against a divisional rival Braves, the Phillies were winning. Phillies\u2019 ace Aaron Nola was throwing a spectacular game. After getting an out in the top of the 6th inning and have thrown 68 pitches in the first game, Nola. Kapler takes out his starter and puts in a left-handed rookie against Freddie Freeman. At the time, the score was 5\u20130. Freeman hits the two run home run. Braves come back and tie in the 8th inning than win the game in the bottom of the ninth inning 8\u20135. After that first impression, everyone in Philadelphia was ready to fire this man. I gave him a chance to see, however I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect from that. Kapler gave a very bad first impression, than the team overall wasn\u2019t that great. They were winning games however, the fans weren\u2019t going to the ballpark because the team never brought that energy. On August 5th of that year, the Phillies were coming off a four-game sweep against the Marlins, the Phillies would be 63\u201348 and held to first place in the NL East with 1 1/2 game lead after that. That would probably be the highest point of the season. The Phillies were looking forward with a good team in a playoff chase, however, the fans still not showed up a lot during the season. That should\u2019ve been a sign. The team started spiraling, they would lose the division lead the very next week. Than they would have an epic collapse in September where they went on the unprecedented losing streak in the end of the season, That fell them to third place and under .500 for the season in 80\u201382. From then on, the fans wanted to fire Gabe Kapler, he showed no fire or emotions in the press conference or on the field to fire up the team. Made some terrible decision with his team, hence like the example above.\nThat should\u2019ve fired him, however that was just year one. With year two, the Phillies thought that they needed a star player to help overcome this situation that they were in. They made the move for Bryce Harper. The Phillies would look poise for their first winning/playoff team since 2011. The Phillies would make other good moves, besides Harper to boost the roster. The team started out on fire and everyone was clicking, except for the manager. Some of his decisions were still in questioned, but the team was winning. Up until June, two of their key additions would do something that would change the fortune of the team. With Andrew McCutchen at first, a simple pop up in the infield was hit by Jean Segura. Segura wasn\u2019t hustling to first. McCuthen\u2019s reaction was to get back to first. However, the infielder noticed that and purposefully missed the pop up so they could get the double play. They would get Segura out at first and get McCutchen on a rundown. Well, McCutchen would tear his ACL. That would be the start of the Phillies spiral season for last year. The manager should\u2019ve pulled Segura out of the game if he did that again. During a losing streak, Segura wasn\u2019t hustling and the manager didn\u2019t pull him from the game. At that point, I was feed up and knew that this season was going no where. The team would fall into another missed opportunity at a chance for the postseason, not only that, they would fall to another average season in 81\u201381 one game more than the year before. A different manager would\u2019ve probably done more with this team.\nSecond situation is the Cleveland Browns, an organization in which winning is not very common. They hire their offensive coordinator in Freddie Kitchens. The team just traded for a star receiver in Odell Beckham Jr. to pair up with his former college teammate Jarvis Landry and Baker Mayfield. With that, a lot of people vocally spoken saying that the Browns are relevant again in terms of winning. They were going to the playoffs and possibly contend in the weak AFC to go to the Super Bowl. The Browns, whom haven\u2019t had a won at least 10 games a year since 2007, they haven\u2019t been to the postseason since 2002. That is way too much pressure for a team that in which a couple of years ago haven\u2019t won a single game. It was complete ludicrous to think that the Browns would be able to compete. The team would end up going 6\u201310 and firing the head coach. He had no chance of surviving this chaotic mess that this team would themselves into. Plus during the season, one of the players would rip the helmet off the top of the QB\u2019s head and uses it as a weapon against him. Things like that was the reason why its total dysfunction in the organization. The coach would get fired at the end of the season.\nThe reason why I tell you these two is how different it could\u2019ve been for each of them if they had just hired the right head coach to reestablish themselves. Both were completely inexperienced head coaches to teams that needed a winning head coach to change the culture. However, one team was expecting an uprise, while the other team was expecting a championship aspirations. That is why these head coaches would get fired after one year. Sometimes its poor decision on the field and other is just total mess outside the lines/plays. These things are the reason why teams would fire their coach after one year."], "topic_list": ["Team Management", "Firing", "Professional Athletes", "Premier League", "Professional Sports", "Coaching", "Sports"], "view_list": [10], "create_time": "Apr 30, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Anthony Gonzalez", "upvote_list": [0], "question_title": "Is it counterintuitive to fire a head coach from a professional sports team after only having the reigns for one season (within reason)?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "103", "name_list": ["Jeremiah Minyard"], "date_list": ["Apr 30, 2020"]}, "1101": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["error"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "", "no_of_follower": 0, "question_author": "", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "error", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": 0, "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "1451": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["error"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "", "no_of_follower": 0, "question_author": "", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "error", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": 0, "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "1212": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["error"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "", "no_of_follower": 0, "question_author": "", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "error", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": 0, "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "1369": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["error"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "", "no_of_follower": 0, "question_author": "", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "error", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": 0, "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "448": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["Gymnastics", "Olympic Games", "Sports", "Countries of the World"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 26, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Balakrishna Rao Rj", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "Can some of the Olympics events happen in such a way that participants will do their gymnastics in their home countries but they are evaluated by panelist in their home countries. so we dont need all participants together in the same place?", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": "172", "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "1320": {"ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["error"], "view_list": [], "create_time": "", "no_of_follower": 0, "question_author": "", "upvote_list": [], "question_title": "error", "respond_collected": 0, "no_of_view": 0, "name_list": [], "date_list": []}, "797": {"ans_list": ["It's a visual effect from the blades of grass being bent away from or towards the viewer due to the direction of the mowing equipment."], "topic_list": ["Grass Crosshatching", "Stadiums", "Grass", "Lawn Maintenance", "Achievements", "Professional Sports", "Sports"], "view_list": [2], "create_time": "Apr 26, 2020", "no_of_follower": 1, "question_author": "Jaime Almodovar", "upvote_list": [0], "question_title": "How is grass crosshatching achieved on sporting grounds?", "respond_collected": 1, "no_of_view": "336", "name_list": ["Anonymous"], "date_list": ["Apr 26, 2020"]}, "67": {"ans_list": ["Not sure who is the current King but it used to be Michael Jackson.\nHe\u2019s bad!\nYou know it.

Also, there is supposedly a possibility of the powder causing wound inflammation and scarring post surgery. I have no idea how, how often, or why this happens, or what the powder is made of, but it seems the FDA thought the problem was serious enough that they needed to stop medical professionals from using them.

When people were labeling him ball hog, narcissist, rapist, dysfunctional, not a role model, etc\u2026 he showed us what Mamba Mentality was. He just took the criticism and used it against the world who wanted to bring him down. He took the Lakers on his back and we all went along for the ride.

Heck even Dwight Howard became beloved in Los Angeles this year.", "From my lifetime of understanding sports, I could give you a few hero and villain from each of the specific franchises from my lifetime. A player that everyone loved and a player that everyone hated during their time with the team. The city of Philadelphia\u2026 You must understand the city and the passion of every player must bring to the table and why they would want you to play that certain way. These players epitomize what a Philly athlete should be and what he shouldn\u2019t be.\nEagles- Most loved- Brian Dawkins: He is the heart and soul of the city of Philadelphia by the way he plays. He plays with passion and anger. He goes out and brings passion from his pregame entrance in Lincoln Financial Field. How he goes out and play and makes a big hit towards the receiver as they catch the ball. Strip the ball from the QB when he goes for a sack. The pregame speeches to the team. His play lead him into Canton, OH.\nEagles-Most hated/disappointed- Danny Watkins: He was a first round bust in which he was a firefighter and not a football player (which is nothing wrong with that). In a draft in which the Eagles need a good offensive lineman. They draft a guy who had only started playing football when he got to Baylor. He wasn\u2019t good enough to make the starting offensive line for the Eagles. They could\u2019ve gotten another lineman in the start of the second round in Rodney Hudson, who is a three time Pro Bowler in that same draft. Right there, the first two picks, at least for me, that was the start of the end of the Andy Reid era which lasted another two more season.\nPhillies-Most loved-Chase Utley: Utley plays the game the right way. He hustle every play and doesn\u2019t brash too much when things are or aren\u2019t going so well. He brings power and speed, he\u2019s not the most flashiest of player, bur he does what needs to be done. He always makes heads up plays, such as during one play as a runner, the hitter has hit a high chopper to first while he was on second. So instead of just stopping at third, he continued to hustle around third to score. From the broadcast, Harry Kalas would make the statement that would stick for the rest of his career, \u2018Chase Utley, you are the man\u2019 No doubt that he makes these heads up play to make the team better. Or plays like in the World Series in 2008, which there was a ground ball up the middle against the speedy batter with a runner in scoring position. He fields the ball towards the second base bag, he knew that he wasn\u2019t going to get the runner. Instead of trying to throwing the runner out, he faked the throw and threw the runner out to prevent the tying run. One of the best heads up plays.\nPhillies-Most hated-Scott Rolen: Scott really was a good player for the Phillies and played some great years during probably the most lean years with the organization. He was a good hitter and a tremendous third baseman, probably the best third baseman since Mike Schmidt. A couple of years before free agency, the Phillies offered an extension to Rolen in order to allow him to play with the great infield with Rollins, Utley, and Howard during the mid-2000\u2019s until 2010, except he refused. During the trade deadline of 2002, the Phillies would trade Rolen to the St. Louis Cardinals. Than, he made comments saying how St. Louis was baseball heaven, which of course was a shot at the Phillies and their fanbase. Once he got traded and made his return to Philadelphia, he would get a great warm reception of boos from the Philly faithful for the rest of his career. (For me personally, I hated Rolen so much that during the 2006 NLCS, I cheered for the great play by Endy Chavez\u2019s catch against him in Game 7, even though it was against the Mets). As good of a player he was, the ending to which he wanted to get traded because the Phillies weren\u2019t winning while he was there.\nSixers-Most loved-Allen Iverson-The Answer, the player who would leave his heart out on the court every time he plays. He would play all 48+ minutes to know that fans are watching him. He stated that there was some kid in the stands that is watching him for the first time. Even with the problem of not showing up to practice or trying while practice is in session. He would leave his heart out on the floor and do the best for the team. He carried the 2001 team offensively into the NBA Finals including the iconic play of him hitting the shot over Tyronne Lu and stepping over him. Hurt or not, he would give it his all and will score at will even as short as he is.\nSixers-Most hated-Andrew Bynum- Simple, he didn\u2019t play at all. Also, he didn\u2019t want to play. It was just a shame because he was a productive player while he was on the Lakers. The Sixers traded for him knowing that he was injured and missed majority of the season because of his knee injuries. However, expecting the production that he has brought to the Lakers to bring in to Philadelphia. They gave up one of their better players in Andre Iguodala for him. That trade turned out to be a mess because Iguodala has had productive seasons since leaving the Sixers while Andrew Bynum didn\u2019t even dressed one time for a game with the Sixers. This trade also set the Sixers franchise back in which they would go and start a trend which is hated in sports. That trend is tanking seasons in order to hope to get the top pick. The season before the trade in the summer would be the last time the Sixers would miss the playoffs for the next 5 seasons without winning more than 38 games. Most disappointing player I\u2019ve seen in a long time.", "I\u2019m a Toronto Raptors guy since Day 1.\nHere are several heroes:\nMasai Ujiri. Our team is the reigning NBA champion, and he\u2019s the man who got us there. Masai has a strong case for being considered the best executive in all sports. He elevated Nick Nurse to the position of head coach, just one of many brilliant moves.\nVince Carter. His legacy is permanently tarnished by the messy details which accompanied his departure from the team. Even so, Air Canada Carter put the franchise on the map.\nKyle Lowry.

He has a championship ring, and the love of Raptors fans around the globe as the team\u2019s leader.\nWe don\u2019t have any villains. I suppose the closest would be Rob Babcock. He was the General Manager who traded away Carter for a case of Gatorade and a fishing rod\u2026OK, maybe a bit more than that. Basketball Transactions Search Results\nAs if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, Babcock could have rescinded the trade the next day after Alonzo Mourning refused to report to Toronto. Given how negatively the trade was graded by the sports press and Toronto fans, Mourning\u2019s intransigence could have been a godsend. Instead Babcock said the deal was done, and later had to buy Mourning out of his contract. Unbelievable. Not too long after that, Babcock lost his job.\nFinally, an anti-hero: Andrea Bargnani. Our team has only once had the first pick in the NBA draft, and our GM at the time, Bryan Colangelo, chose the big Italian. I\u2019m refraining from calling Colangelo a villain, largely because the 2006 draft was dreadful, and he made more sound decisions than poor ones. Bargnani became a respectable player, but faded badly towards the end of his time in Toronto. He also didn\u2019t seem to care much about getting better, winning or any of that soft\u2019n\u2019squishy stuff.", "My favourite sports franchise is the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League\nAnd the most popular athlete in Toronto is a former Argo.

Spinks won a Gold Medal at the 1976 Olympics. But he had a 6\u20130\u20131 record when he fought Ali. The draw was with Journeyman Scott LeDoux. However-Ali was out of shape, and was facing the daunting prospect of a 4th fight with Ken Norton-who was the number one contender in a mandatory title defense. He took the Spinks fight as a discretionary defense for an easy payday and kind of a tune-up. Except Spinks pressured him like the Energizer bunny, and Ali was unprepared. Spinks won a Split decision and a surprise upset. Jose Sulamain-the crooked WBC president said Spinks had to fight Norton in 60 days for peanuts or be stripped of the title. This was unheard of-Any champion has one year to fight the # 1 contender in a mandatory defense. Spinks who was paid $170,000 for the first fight-was offered $3.75 Million to give Ali a rematch. He accepted. The WBC stripped him and gave the title to Norton, who lost it in his first defense against Larry Holmes. However-Spinks still had the WBA belt, and the public and Ring Magazine recognized him as the real champ. In the rematch- Ali-who trained hard and was in much better shape- smothered Spinks\u2019 swarming attack, and jabbed and grabbed his way to an easy 15 round decision-sportswriters said what he should have done the first time.

For example, core strength, agility, quick feet (speed ladder drills), explosive strength are needed for both football or boxing. Similarly for weight training most athletes do the same compound strength exercises.\nof course there are technical specifics in both. and some sports will require more of one than the other etc.. But I\u2019d say at least 60% of your strength and conditioning program will complement both sports and keep you well conditioned for good performance regardless.\nthis is an example of a weeks Strength and conditioning program that would vary from week to week -\nDay 1 - strength training (compound) & speed ladder drills\nday 2 - swimming\nday 3 - rest\nday 4 - core strengthening and cardio\nday 5 - explosive drills and agility training\nday 6 & 7 - rest\nOne way of managing your time is that you could dedicate 1 week just for strength and conditioning (example above) then week 2 just play football (soccer) and week 3 just do boxing. I would not recommend switching sports in the same week as you may lose momentum. While you play football and do boxing this would also include conditioning drills that are more specific to those sports -\nthis way in each three week cycle you\u2019re staying in good condition and giving a descent amount of time to both sports. I\u2019m not a big fan of doing just one sport for a few weeks then switching to another for a few weeks. While focusing one a single sport for large amounts of time may give you good momentum as good progress allot of this can be lost if you don\u2019t play that sport for extended periods of time while you do the other. So while you may be training hard for both sports your progress will be slow and won\u2019t reflect the hard work you put in. Changing from week to week means you\u2019re not leaving such long periods of time between sports hence whatever progress you made will remain fresh and allow you to build up and improve.\nanother good trick to get more training in would be to wake up early.
