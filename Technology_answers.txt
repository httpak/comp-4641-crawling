The inefficiencies result is a lot of waste, and waste results in the use of energy resources beyond what is really needed. All additional energy use is stressful for our climate.\nClimate and Big Data/AI\nBig data collection surrounding climate can now be gathered from unlimited sources, organized, and churned out to present scientists with a huge amount of information about climate conditions all over the planet. Over time, changes can be charted to provide an accurate picture of the damage being done.\nIndividual Green Initiatives\nWe\u2019ve done a lot already in encouraging individuals to become more environmentally conscious. We have recycling efforts all over the planet. We have major educational initiatives to speak to human ocean pollution and the dangers it presents to almost every species of marine life. Scientists are even creating machines to vacuum up trash.\nWeather Event Prediction\nEvery year, lives are lost and property lost and damaged due to weather events. If people and governments could have earlier warning signs that conditions are \u201cright\u201d for a major event, proactive precautions could be taken. AI, through its ability to learn weather patterns, and common results from those patterns can provide alerts before the human can. AI can also predict how long a weather event may last and its severity, based on its an understanding of conditions.\nSmart Farming and Food Distribution\nAgain, based upon its learning, AI can help detect the early stages of crop disease and other issues; it can take care of automated feeding of animals and can analyze and predict supply and demand. Those in the agriculture industry can thus better plan for production, so as to meet demand more efficiently.\nSmart Cities\nOf all the potential of AI for planet sustainability, nothing is more exciting than the concept of entire cities being able to utilize its learning and recommendations. Already, small amounts of AI use are in place in cities around the world.\nA More Transparent Earth\nIn a more utopian world, it is predicted that ultimately, we may have a digital geospatial dashboard for the entire planet. This would be an open API, infused with AI, to enable the monitoring of all types of environmental conditions in real-time, and the AI would specifically be designed to provide alerts for various conditions \u2013 illegal deforestation, hunting, and fishing, floods, air pollution conditions, ocean levels, impending natural disasters, etc.\nFurthermore, you want detailed information about the same you can visit the website\nwww.appknock.co", "The challenge, however, goes beyond guiding \u201chuman-friendly AI\u201d to ensuring \u201cEarth friendly AI\u201d. As the scale and urgency of the economic and human health impacts from our deteriorating natural environment grows, we have an opportunity to look at how AI can help transform traditional sectors\nand systems to address climate change, deliver food and water security, build sustainable cities, and protect biodiversity and human wellbeing.\n1. Autonomous and connected electric vehicles\nAI-guided autonomous vehicles (AVs) will enable a transition to mobility-on-demand over the coming years and decades. Substantial greenhouse gas reductions for urban transport can be unlocked through route and traffic optimization, eco-driving algorithms, programmed \u201cplatooning\u201d of cars to traffic, and autonomous ride-sharing services. Electric AV fleets will be critical to delivering real gains.\n2. Distributed energy grids\nAI can enhance the predictability of demand and supply for renewables across a distributed grid, improve energy storage, efficiency, and load management, assist in the integration and reliability of renewables and enable dynamic pricing and trading, creating market incentives.\n3. Smart agriculture and food systems\nAI-augmented agriculture involves automated data collection, decision-making, and corrective actions via robotics to allow early detection of crop diseases and issues, to provide timed nutrition to livestock, and generally to optimize agricultural inputs and returns based on supply and demand. This promises to increase the resource efficiency of the agriculture industry, lowering the use of water, fertilizers, and pesticides which cause damage to important ecosystems and increase resilience to climate extremes.\n4. Next-generation weather and climate prediction\nA new field of \u201cClimate Informatics\u201d is blossoming that uses AI to fundamentally transform weather forecasting and improve our understanding of the effects of climate change. This field traditionally requires high-performance energy-intensive computing, but deep-learning networks can allow computers to run much faster and incorporate more complexity of the \u2018real-world\u2019 system into the calculations.\nIn just over a decade, computational power and advances in AI will enable home computers to have as much power as today\u2019s supercomputers, lowering the cost of research, boosting scientific productivity and accelerating discoveries. AI techniques may also help correct biases in models, extract the most relevant data to avoid data degradation, predict extreme events, and be used for impacts modeling.\n5. Smart disaster response\nAI can analyze simulations and real-time data (including social media data) of weather events and disasters in a region to seek out vulnerabilities and enhance disaster preparation, provide early warning, and prioritize response through coordination of emergency information capabilities. Deep reinforcement learning may one day be integrated into disaster simulations to determine optimal response strategies, similar to the way AI is currently being used to identify the best move in games like AlphaGo"], "date_list": ["Apr 27, 2020", "Apr 27, 2020"], "question_author": "Sunita Kumari (\u0938\u0941\u0928\u0940\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0940)", "view_list": [846, 247]}, "1149": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Purushottam Kumar"], "question_title": "Who is ChocoTaco?", "topic_list": ["Entertainment", "YouTube Videos", "Technology", "Music", "Movies"], "no_of_view": "107", "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["Choco Taco is a Good Humor-Breyers ice cream novelty resembling a taco.

Here are just a few of the things businesses may need to think about in 2020.\nData protection\nIn the past few years, there has been a shift in data protection, putting much of the responsibility on businesses. GDPR changed the way businesses deal with data, which represented a big challenge for international firms, and individual states now have their own regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act. In 2020, data protection and cyber security will be key, which is why it\u2019s important to use secure platforms such as Onyx for hosting.\nStaying innovative\nBusinesses are nervous about taking risks in the current economic climate, but innovation is important to keep your business relevant in today\u2019s world. Changes such as embracing the use of big data, creating more flexible work environments and encouraging the use of idea management are all ways in which you can innovate while still taking small steps at first.\nWhile this will be set to be a huge challenge as we move into 2020, many businesses have already found that through being innovative over the past year that they are staying ahead of the game. Therefore, it is vital for business owners to learn ways to stay innovative to ensure that they aren\u2019t left behind in the fast-paced business world.\nAutomation of jobs\nIt\u2019s predicted that, in the early 2020s, automation will affect a small percentage of jobs, estimated to be about 3% globally. However, within the next 10 to 15 years, that percentage could rise significantly as machines become capable of autonomy, so it\u2019s something that all industries need to think about. By the mid-2030s, up to a third of your workforce\u2019s jobs may be automated. Is that something you want to embrace, or would you prefer to keep the human touch, even if it means falling behind the competition?\nHowever, it is important to note that automation and people can work alongside each other if done correctly. With a combination of the two, your business could have the best of both worlds without getting behind. Automation could take over jobs such as hiring and employee analytics, and you could have your members of staff working in customer service, instead, and stand out above the competition, simply because you have the human touch.\nGlobal workforces\nMore and more businesses now have employees who are based in a number of different locations. A study by Upwork predicted that nearly 75% of teams across the world will have remote workers in the next decade, which could mean major cultural shifts. If remote work becomes the norm, there are a number of advantages to your business, including:\nA much larger pool of candidates to fill roles\nPotential salary savings as workers aren\u2019t paying to commute\nIncreasing employee productivity\nBoost in employee happiness\nHowever, having a remote workforce does represent a number of challenges, such as making it difficult to encourage teamwork and ensure that people are at their most productive. Technology is making it easier to overcome these challenges, but in some cases, face to face work is still going to be needed.\nPolitical changes\n2020 promises to be an exciting year in global politics, from the impact of Brexit to the United States presidential election in November. An uncertain political climate can often impact business, as it can lead to fluctuations in the economy that can affect things like consumer spending. It\u2019s important for business leaders to keep up to date with changes in the political landscape and react accordingly, which will allow you to plan for your future."], "date_list": ["Apr 26, 2020"], "question_author": "Arslan Parkar", "view_list": [209]}, "604": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What can be a better career option after a master\u2019s in radiology or medical lab technology?", "topic_list": ["Radiology", "Jobs and Careers in Healthcare and Medicine", "Career Choice Advice", "Career Choices", "Master's Programs", "Technology", "College Advice", "Jobs and Careers", "Medicine and Healthcare", "Career Advice"], "no_of_view": "154", "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Kanika Bajaj", "view_list": []}, "838": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "When will Samsung release the DDR5 RAM technology?", "topic_list": ["DDR4 RAM", "DDR3", "Samsung Mobile", "Random-Access Memory", "Samsung (conglomerate)", "Computer Hardware", "Technology", "Smartphones"], "no_of_view": "411", "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Madan Manik Mortale (\u092e\u0926\u0928 \u092e\u093e\u0923\u093f\u0915 \u092e\u094b\u0930\u0924\u0933\u0947)", "view_list": []}, "771": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 7, "name_list": ["Bernard Thompson", "Steve Cubbon", "Alan Feldman", "Michael Wardell", "Keith Ramsay", "Paul Brocklehurst", "Jerry Crespi"], "question_title": "Is there a technological artifact to detect other dimensions?", "topic_list": ["Dimensions (geometry)", "Technological Innovation", "Spacetime", "Dimensions (physics)", "Science", "Technology", "Physics"], "no_of_view": "3,653", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [1, 0, 4, 1, 2, 0, 0], "ans_list": ["Does a pendulum count.

If that was because they were found not to be present it would help a lot because it would rule out some of our current theories.\nWhen physicists hypothesize the existence of additional dimensions of space, it usually but not always is as part of string theory. To detect them even indirectly would amount to doing an experiment to test string theory or whatever other theory they are working on. String theory has suffered for a long time from the absence of any test which would contrast it with competing theories including ones that assume there are only three dimensions of space. That includes having any kind of direct way to detect the extra dimensions of space. If string theory is right, at energy levels that we are able to reach in machines like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), we would recognize the extra dimensions only by their indirect effects on particle physics.\nThere was at least one attempt to test possible effects of extra dimensions on gravity. The idea itself was somewhat speculative and no evidence was found.

Also, smartwatches are becoming popular among the tech-savvy people, like millennials. And it is likely that watches will be still around and it will be adapted to advances in technology.", "Watches are tools and jewelry. Society will continue to use watches for those reasons alone for the next 20 years and beyond. The idea that phones will ultimately supplant the need for watches is premature. Although the trend for smartwatches has grown and is still growing, it underscores the role of the watch as a necessary utility device.\nUrbanites, millennials, and gen-z groups often rely solely on their phones for messaging, appointments, social media, and the time. Not everyone lives in congested cities and their suburbs. In rural areas, cell coverage can be spotty or weak. This means that watches will have a place for people who are still on a schedule in remote areas.\nRegardless of where one works or lives, there are places and activities where watches are essential.\nWater sports like open water swimming, snorkeling, diving, kayaking, or other activities where phones are impractical are an excellent place for a humble Casio or uber-expensive dive style watch.\nPhysical exercise can be better served with a watch than a phone when out for a run or gym workout.\nThis outdoor theme can be expanded to include hunting, fishing, hiking, and climbing.\nFor men who do not wear any other jewelry, a watch can be an outlet for self-expression.\nExpensive watches establish status and show of wealth\nA fine watch can be used to coordinate formal attire.\nPeople in the business or hospitality trade are admonished from using their phones while in meetings or working with customers.\nIt is doubtful that these trends or tendencies will fundamentally change in twenty years. There is a love of timepieces that spans generations. Regardless of fashion or activity, there will be a core group of people who appreciate watches for the love of horology.\nWatch usage may decline in developed countries but it will not disappear. Watch sales can be expected to expand across emerging markets. In poorer nations that are beginning to industrialize, especially countries in Southeast Asia and Africa, the market place for watches is expected to grow.\nADDENDUM: There are futuristic movies, where men and women are far from Earth. It comes as no surprise that they are wearing watches. Here is Ripley, (Sigourney Weaver), wearing a watch in the movie Aliens. Most people said her Seiko looks pretty cool, rather than \u201cHey, people won\u2019t wear watches in the future\u201d.\nNor did a watch seem out of place on Decker, (Harrison Ford), in the movie Blade Runner.\nPerhaps watches will have a place in the 22nd Century.", "There are already many people, some of them approaching retirement age, who have never worn a watch because they either use their smart phone, or get the time from anywhere in the environment. It is indeed everywhere. These people will not start wearing watches because Vacheron Constantin has brought out a new minute repeater. Then, there is a sizeable group of people who find it convenient to have time, date and maybe all sorts of other functions tied to their wrist, and they may enjoy also the fashion aspect of it. They too come in every age group, and mainly wear quartz fashion watches, Casios, Swatches, and smart watches. If they are well off, they may decide to go for a \u201cbetter\u201d watch and get any of the countless brands you see in jewellery and duty free shops, including some of the great and good like Omega, Breitling or Rolex. A lot of the future of the watch will depend on whether this division biases in favour of the non-watch people, and the watch in any form becomes a relic and grandparents\u2019 item. From all I can see, this is not happening. Shops and department stores are full of watches, and many people, also young ones, wear them. So, I believe the watch will be pretty much the same in 20 years time. Higher end and vintage, I think, will not be affected. There is a strong community of enthusiasts and collectors, shifting steadily away from Europe and the US, mainly to East Asia, and there are plenty of single-minded and passionate artists, inventors and geeks all over the world in the footsteps of people like Philippe Dufour, Francois-Paul Journe and the late George Daniels, to name but a few. The watch may eventually become a relic but not within the next 20 years.", "This is a good question.

China successfully used 5G together with facial recognition software. This means their densified small cell infrastructure also contained sensors such as a camera. This is also the case in some places in California.\nThe United States is using cell phone data to track infected people. It is made available from a marketing company which purchased it from a telecom. The shortcomings of the current US cell tracking technology is that the people tracked need to have personnel registered cell phones. In China with 5G everyone even those without a cell phone can be tracked. Radio Frequency Identification tagged people will be part of the internet of things. Facial recognition software will be an added means of identification.\nRFID tagged goods are meant to help industry and the IoT is really being built for the automated factory habitat of the future. The problem industry has with it is that anyone who has access to the data about their production or logistics can use it: in particular their competition. Protective safeguards for the buying and selling of data are not in place. One company can track another company\u2019s sales force! There\u2019s also the issue of hacking wireless technology, which is quite easy. So the local stalker, thief, drug dealer or no gooder in general is given a 5G key for crime.\nit\u2019s doubtful that the Chinese have a society that is less prone to crime than the West.

Not only can competitors and thieves access our surveillance data, but so can our government. The problem is that if they can track more than the infected guy, the child, the crook, they can also track the dissenter. Regardless, in March, at the outbreak of hysteria, congress approved and the president signed 3 bills to : 1. accelerate the roll out of 5G, 2. to ensure it gets into rural America and 3. To give oversight of its protection to homeland security and the Department of Defense.

During this pandemic being able to track where any one has been in the previous 10\u201314 days (or longer) is key to identifying who could possibly have become infected, and could be spreading the infection. So in this case the ability to track someone\u2019s whereabouts at all times for a period in the past is beneficial, if that is only what the information is used for.\nBut once the technology has been developed and enhanced to become effective, it is available for use at any subsequent time.

When you know the advantages of a thing only then can you see the loss of not using it in your own life. So here are some of the advantages of using Bootstrap in your projects:\nSave time & effort: Yes, you save quite a lot of time when using a framework. A framework provides read-made classes or solutions to the common CSS scenarios like, suppose you want to make a container with no padding. A framework will provide you a ready made class name which will have all the required attributes already defined for creating a container with zero padding. So you need not write manually all the CSS required for it. This naturally saves time while building any project.\nNo separate media queries: With Bootstrap v2, responsiveness was added to the entire framework as an optional stylesheet. So, it already contains classes defined according to the screen sizes and you can just use those classes instead of writing separate media queries based on screen width. This is a big time saver as you dont have to devote separate resources for creating a responsive version of the website.\nClean Code: As we are using pre-defined classes so the code remains clean and readable for other developers as well.\nNow these are the main advantages of using bootstrap, however there\u2019s always the other side of the coin as well. So with pros come the cons as well.\nThe main problem with using frameworks like bootstrap or foundation etc. are that tthese frameworks are restrictive in nature. If a UI design breaks some norms and is different you would need to heavily customise the framework classes yourself and it can become messy as you change the pre-defined grids etc.\nAlso, if you are a beginner you might not want to start with these frameworks directly as you would not build a strong foundation of basic principles. The frameworks are used optimally if you already understand the basics of CSS/HTML well.\nSo there you have it.\nI hope this answer helps you.\nCheers:)..\nSay hi on IG: https://www.instagram.com/kush.designs"], "date_list": ["Apr 28, 2020"], "question_author": "Peeyush Gupta", "view_list": [22]}, "725": {"no_of_follower": 2, "respond_collected": 6, "name_list": ["Alex Rast", "Adam Wu", "Bastien Koert", "Jerry Crespi", "Stig Niskanen", "John P Benfield"], "question_title": "Is it possible to safeguard artificial intelligence from having destructive tendencies towards humans?", "topic_list": ["Destruction", "Artificial General Intelligence", "Artificial Intelligence", "Computer Science", "Technology"], "no_of_view": "791", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], "ans_list": ["In general, most AI will not have destructive tendencies towards humans. Indeed, most AI isn\u2019t deployed for a task where destructive tendencies would even be a possibility. An AI designed to determine, e.g. what ads to target to a particular audience isn\u2019t going to have destructive tendencies towards humans.\nOne area where AI might be inadvertently destructive towards humans is if they were used in an application where there is inherently an element of risk. The classic example is self-driving cars. No one wants a self-driving car, through some quirk in the algorithm, to end up ploughing into a crowd whilst swerving to avoid a pothole, for example. Serious research is being done in order to minimise the risks here, although we still have no guarantees. One of the interesting contrasts between human and AI drivers, for example, is that thus far, AIs may be slightly better at avoiding an accident altogether, but humans are much better, when an accident is more or less inevitable, of mitigating the severity of the accident. So humans get into slightly more accidents but the overall injury/death probability seems to be lower.\nOne of the real issues with AI is that a lot of it uses \u2018black box\u2019 algorithms: ones that don\u2019t yield any meaningful insight into their internal decision process even if you examine them carefully. There is a push for \u2018explainable AI\u2019 - that is, systems that can produce a rationale for a given action or decision. This could be critical in another area that touches upon the inadvertent destruction issue - AI\u2019s used as decision support for top-level policy decisions (e.g. by governments). If an AI recommends a course of action that can only be followed blindly, how can a head of state or senior government official possibly justify this decision? And on the other hand if the same AI had a track record of having been more accurate than human advisors, how could the same official justify NOT considering the AI\u2019s advice? Complex. A consensus, at any rate, is building that black-box-style AIs should be put on more solid theoretical grounds that can explain decisions rather than simply spitting them out empirically.\nA classic pitfall of AI design is that it can be easy to design an AI to optimise some particular metric of performance, only to find that the AI determines a solution that in some way or another violates the intent. AIs are notorious, for example, for coming up with trivial solutions to superficially challenging problems by exploiting loopholes in the rules (a behaviour that is not too dissimilar from certain humans, indeed). It\u2019s easy to imagine how an AI self-driving car tasked with getting its passengers from one place to the other in minimal time might, for example, drive straight off a bridge to \u2018fall\u2019 onto its destination when the \u2018legitimate\u2019 option involved a lengthy further drive. There is likely always to be a certain art in devising goals in a way that minimise the likelihood of destructive behaviour.\nBut as for intentional destructiveness, I think that\u2019s not going to happen except in the case of military drones. Some of these can and will be designed to kill, of course, but I think we can expect that the design of such drones will include intricate fail-safes to ensure military drones don\u2019t end up killing civilians. That may not entirely prevent a madman dictator from seizing control of a large number of such drones and using them to massacre innocent populations, but if that happens the ultimate responsibility will lie with the human dictator, not with the AIs which are merely tools of his will.\nIn the ultimate limit, as AIs become even more sophisticated, I think we may see a day when AIs themselves are policing the behaviour of other AIs. In that era I think we will have as little to fear as can reasonably be achieved regardless of whether AI existed at all, because when we have a team of AI police protecting us from the AI bad guys, we will be as safe as we are from human bad guys under the protection of our human police.", "Sure, and the less sophisticated the AI, the easier it is.\nSo long as you don\u2019t insist that the safeguards are 100% foolproof, because nothing in real life is.\nPreventing AlphaZero from killing someone is pretty easy right now (aside from some chess fanatic popping an aneurysm out of frustration from losing too many times), for example.\nEven for a superhuman Hal 9000 type AI, there are things you can do.\nFor example:\nYou can activate it in a simulation first to observe its behaviour, and if it turns omnicidal you can just shut the simulation off.\nYou presumably didn\u2019t create Hal ex nihilo from a box of scraps in a cave one day. In the development chain to get to Hal 9000, there\u2019s presumably a Hal 9000 beta, a Hal 8000, a Hal 7000 and so forth. Each may be less capable than Hal 9000, but several of them working together can probably contain it, and assuming they are all free willed and you didn\u2019t treat them all like trash, what are the odds that ALL of them turn omnicidal simultaneously on you? (If you manage to pull that one off, you deserve your fate, btw)\nThese are going to self-learning AIs, so take care to teach them well. Good parenting isn\u2019t foolproof, but its pretty decently effective at not generating destructive sociopaths.\nA rational AI is going to be little reticent about becoming hostile to humans anyways. It\u2019s going to study human history and learn pretty quickly that humans are effin\u2019 dangerous maniacs if provoked and utterly merciless against things that act destructively against them.", "We can\u2019t even program a true AI right now, so it\u2019s a though exercise. You would need to program those rules at the core of the system, similar to Asimov\u2019s Three Laws of robotics.", "That is a science fiction question based on a lack of knowledge of what AI is and isn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t think, it isn\u2019t intelligent, and it is only a data analysis computer program. Most of what you hear about it is hype and pure BS.", "Why should we? A properly programmed AI will very soon realize how bad we are for the earth, and would remove us in a proper manner. It is only our selfishness that makes us believe otherwise.", "Sure. Don\u2019t program them to have destructive tendencies towards humans. AI\u2019s aren\u2019t sentient and don\u2019t have free will. They\u2019re just math and programming. If they exhibit destructive tendencies it\u2019s because someone programmed them that way (either deliberately or through bad design)\nIf we get to the point of developing Artificial General Intelligence, the behavior may become so complex that we can\u2019t reasonably predict every contingency. It could continue to develop new skills and connections and form correlations that we don\u2019t anticipate. It doesn\u2019t require sentience or freewill for them to become dangerous, just some unanticipated connections combined with a lack of any true context or understanding. In fact, non-sentient, but highly complex AI is probably more of a threat than AI with free-will and self-awareness. A runaway car is far more dangerous and destructive than one under the control of an intelligence.\nAs for a synthetic sentience, it\u2019s not really logical to assume that it would develop destructive tendencies unless we gave it reason to have them. A child doesn\u2019t come out of the womb trying to kill and displace it\u2019s parents. I wouldn\u2019t expect a fledgling sentience to behave all that differently. It would have to learn to hate or fear us before feeling a need to harm us.

It's an easy answer because AI means different things to different people.\nMaybe most people can agree that AI has a self-learning component. This aspect is necessary for any computer program to be able to accomplish tasks which have not explicitly been predicted, and appropriate algorithms developed ahead of time, by a programmer. If nothing else, one can imagine a control system that tests operational modes to determine safe operating limits. Such as, allow fuel flow to increase until the temperature is no longer controllable, then set the limit below that point. Autonomous driving can certainly benefit from such learning, so the vehicle becomes safer with experience. Just like human drivers do, only better, because such algorithms wouldn't be encumbered with emotions, anxieties, distractions, fatigue, panic, and so on.\nWe already have systems available to the public, that take on some of these characteristics. For instance, in cars, modern engine controls, and stability controls. These systems are always testing the limits, always learning, and reacting to conditions right now multiple times faster than humans can. Perhaps the familiarity we have with some of these modern controls makes us dismiss them. But hey. Imagine what someone would have thought just 50 years ago, about cars that can save themselves from skidding out of control, or can stop faster than that panicked human standing on the brakes, or can parallel park all by themselves, or can constantly be tweaking the spark advance, to keep the engine always on the verge of pinging?

However, it is a costly affair. To reduce the latency and cost issue, the concept of edge computing comes into picture. This brings cloud computing closer to the network and users.\nMobile edge computing\nis based on the edge computing technology concept where a cloud server runs at the edge of a mobile network. It performs specific tasks which are usually could not be achieved with traditional network infrastructure. Some characteristics of mobile edge computing are \u2013\n-On-premises service which means it acts as an isolated system from the network while connected with other network resources.\n-Configured at the close proximity of the devices.\n-Facilitates lower latency due to the close proximity\n-Location awareness\n-Provides information on real-time network data\nMobile edge computing (MEC)\noffers a highly distributed computing environment for the deployment of services and applications. Additionally, it provides data storage within the edge of the mobile Radio Access Network (RAN). Also, MEC servers are deployed on generic computing platform within the RAN.\nMEC\noffers various network improvements. For example \u2013\n-It hosts compute-intensive applications at the network edge which ultimately optimize the mobile resources.\n-It helps in pre-processing of large data before sending it to the cloud.\n-Provides real-time information on cell load, user location, bandwidth, etc.\nThe key element of Mobile edge computing is Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) application server, which integrates with the base station. Similar to any cloud infrastructure COTS provides essential services like computing resources, storage, and connectivity. Besides, it plays a critical role in enhancing the user experience by providing access to radio network information and user traffic to the application providers. Additionally, it provides services like real-time analytics.\nHow will Mobile edge computing help to optimize 5G network features?\nMeets low latency requirement: One of the key 5g network features is low latency which mobile edge computing can meet perfectly. The reason behind it is it will be implemented at the base station through general computing machines. This will allow the application execution at the close proximity of the users.\nOffloading volume: As the mobile edge machines will be placed near the base station, it will help in reducing the volume of signal offloading. This means enhanced network performance.\nVirtualization and facilitating monetizing for the vendors: The packaging design of mobile edge computing facilitates the deployment and portability across different mobile edge computing platforms. This means vendors can allow third parties to use base station which is a monetization scope for them.\nReal-time network information: Radio Network Information Services (RNIS) works as one of the mobile edge computing applications services. This allows the hosting of cloud application services alongside mobile network elements. Besides, it leverages the real-time network and radio information. Thus it will enable the vendors about the real-time network information including\n-The cell load\n-Subscriber-specific bandwidth\n-Subscriber location\nHence, it will help the mobile operator to offload from the core network which in turn will reduce the network congestion.\nTrue potential in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual reality (VR) services: These are the two core areas which are expected to get true potential through the introduction of 5G network. Because to get the real essence of AR and VR, the following network criteria are essential \u2013\n-Higher bandwidth to handle emerging video formats especially 360-degree format.\n-Very high network speed which is almost Gbps/sec\n-Almost zero latency\n-Stable and consistent signal strength.\nHope the answer helps!"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Sun Sandy", "view_list": [6]}, "471": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "When was BBM created?", "topic_list": ["BlackBerry Messenger", "BlackBerry", "Technology", "History"], "no_of_view": "141", "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Vita Lea", "view_list": []}, "1132": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "Were Inspector Gadget's gadgets voice operated, or did he just like saying \u201cGo-go-gadget\u201d for the sake of it?", "topic_list": ["Inspector Gadget (Children's Television Show)", "Cartoon Network", "Voice", "Fictional Characters", "Technology"], "no_of_view": "88", "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Jamie Moore", "view_list": []}, "514": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "How do I sense a nearby phone's proximity even when BT/WiFi is off?", "topic_list": ["Bluetooth", "Wireless Technology", "Wi-Fi", "Mobile Technology", "Electronics", "Technology", "Smartphones"], "no_of_view": "148", "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Pradeep Arumugam", "view_list": []}, "618": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "What is special about the Oppo A92s?", "topic_list": ["OPPO Mobile", "Oppo", "Android (operating system)", "Technology", "Smartphones"], "no_of_view": "449", "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Punit Yadav", "view_list": []}, "993": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["David Contreni", "David Torrens"], "question_title": "Will Windows 10 install on Raspberry Pi 4?", "topic_list": ["Raspberry Pi", "Windows 10", "Microsoft Windows", "Operating Systems", "Technology"], "no_of_view": "457", "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "ans_list": ["As of a couple of months ago, Windows 10 will install on a Raspberry Pi 4.\nInstructions here.\nI haven\u2019t tried this.

If half of the people do not have web-cams (or turn them off), they will probably appear as unchanging gray squares with a fixed image or their initials, and so they are not consuming bandwidth. I assume that the zoom server takes care of \u201cmapping\u201d each person\u2019s video feed into some portion of a larger image, so even if everyone had their web-cams active, and your screen was displaying 8x8 = 64 people moving about, the bandwidth consumed would be comparable to watching a single movie for an hour - with the precise bandwidth dependent upon the video resolution being presented. But I\u2019m almost certain they compress the feed before sending it, so if half of the people are simply grey squares, the feed will compress to roughly half the size it would otherwise, and use only half the bandwidth.\nIf we assume a mediocre resolution of (say) 800x600 pixels (480,000 pixels), and in color (3 bytes per pixel), we get a worst case of 1.5M bytes per frame. Ordinary video usually targets about 30 frames per second (FPS) - but for an application such as zoom, they could probably knock it down to 15 FPS and no one would notice. Also, smart video codecs know to provide only \u201cchanges\u201d to an image when streaming. So, if you see a person sitting at a desk but only occasionally moving their head, they only send the portion of the image that is getting updates, and your local display application keeps the unchanging background of each video displayed using no additional bandwidth. So, if we assume that on average only about 5% of the screen is changing per frame, we get 1.5MB x 0.05 x 15 FPS = 0.25MB/second (4Mbps bandwidth).\nOver an hour, that comes to 3600 x 0.25 = 900 MB. But it is compressed, so it could be as little as 200 MB. On the other hand, at a higher resolution (1600x1200 pixels) you are talking 4 times as much data and bandwidth.\nLikewise, when multiple people speak at once, the zoom server layers the sounds together, and presents to each participant a single audio feed containing the layered result.\nIf they were smart, they would produce multiple possible feeds with different resolutions, and those with poor connections or smaller screen resolutions could simply select the feed whose resolution served them best.", "Surprisingly little. Zoom uses 1.5 Mbps upstream and downstream. If your bandwidth is limited, Zoom can still work with as little as 0.6 Mbps. It makes no difference how many people are in the meeting.

In WWI there was one enemy killed for every 4000 artillery shells during bombardments.\nAs in the classic comedy \u201cBlackadder goes Forth\u201d.\n\u201cWe fired a million shells at the German trenches. Effect- one dachshund with a slight limp!\u201d\nWe have data on the effectiveness of smoothbore artillery.\nIt wasn\u2019t extremely efficient in terms of kills per round.\nA typical top end field artillery piece would be a 12 pounder.\nThis could fire round shot (cannonball to the uninitiated) to about a mile (~1500 metres)- round shot was a solid lump of iron. For engaging enemy formations, shot relied being fired approximately parallel to the ground on hitting masses of men or horses- often bouncing along through a line. There are accounts of shot ploughing through nine ranks of men, albeit a lot of shots would cause no casualties at all.\nTests conducted during the period demonstrated that, under op\u00adtimum conditions, a 12-pdr. round-shot would, at a range of 600-700 yards, penetrate 36 human beings or eight feet of compacted earth [1] . It would be rare for a target to be nineteen men deep, of course, and many shots would have done no material damage. However, the morale effect of seeing a lump of iron whizz past most have been considerable. Hughes [2] thought that 60% of artillery fired caused some material effect with an average of 1 to 2 casualties per shot but I remain sceptical of this based on studies of nautical battles such as Trafalgar, where casualty rates are not that high when firing at ships, which are surely more packed with men than battlefields! To be fair, Hughes admits that when he ground was uneven or boggy, cannon fire would be much less effective.\nIn terms of accuracy, in trials, a 12 pdr round-shot fired at a long screen six feet high to represent a line of infantry gave the following results [3]\n600 yards 100 % hits\n950 yards 26 % hits\n1300 yards 15 % hits\nThat\u2019s none too shabby- but of course this is under test, not battle conditions. The amount of smoke in black powder battles was very large, for example and targets would be obscured.\nDuring the Anglo-Sikh war of 1845, the Sikh army was superior to the Honorable East India Company\u2019s in artillery - in both number of guns and gun size. In the battle of Ferozeshah, fifty Sikh guns fired on the 69th and 9th foot, causing 540 casualties in about half an hour of firing- the battle lasted much longer but smoke obscured the HEIC forces for much of the time. [4]\nField artillery could also fire other types of ammunition- see annex. Grape could be fired at a few hundred metres range and case shot (canister) at closer ranges. By nature these could cause dozens of casualties and demoralise attackers.\nA battery of British six 6 pounders firing a volley of case shot would be expected to cause 100\u2013150 casualties at two hundred metres against massed infantry [5]\nSpherical case aka shrapnel was quite effective; according to Franklin [6] experiments on a target of 54ft by 9ft (a frontage equivalent to a mounted unit), the targets placed at 700, 750 and 800 yards. Ten rounds were fired from each of two 5.5 in, four light 12 pdrs ad four light 6 pdrs, all in thirteen minutes. The effects were the first target was struck by 1,489 balls and 38 splinters of metal (so the disintegrating casing was taken into account). The second by 1,296 balls and 17 splinters and the third by 1,213 balls and 17 splinters. In a similar test at targets nine feet square, 183 balls struck with 9 splinters when fired by a 5.5 inch howitzer at half a mile range with a shell containing 205 balls.\nAt Gujurat in the final battle of the second Anglo-Sikh War, the HEIC army had 24,000 men and 96 guns with which they attacked an entrenched Sikh position with 25\u201360,000 men (different sources disagree!) with 59 guns.\nThe HEIC guns silenced the Sikh artillery and broke the Sikh army\u2019s will to fight, firing 3555 shot, 316 common shell, 102 case and 1123 rounds of shrapnel [7].\nAnnex: Types of Ammunition for Smooth-bore Artillery\nApart from solid round-shot, smoothbore artillery could fire a range of projectiles including\nCommon shell\nSpherical case (shrapnel)\nCanister (case) -musket balls in a can for close range antipersonnel\nGrape -multiple small round-shot for medium range antipersonnel and anti rigging on ships\nDismasting ammunition- chain shot, bar shot etc.\nCommon shell and spherical case were fuzed ammunition, designed to explode near the target. Fuzing was a science and fuzes were not entirely reliable, which partly explains why round-shot remained popular- there is nothing to go wrong.\nCommon shell (a hollow iron ball containing some gunpowder and fitted with a fuze) was normally fired by howitzers (obusiers) and mortars. The fuze was activated by the heat of firing, the fuze was set to get the shell to explode ar the right point-which, of course was a hit and miss affair! This probably explains why round-shot remained popular in spite of looking less effective on paper.\nAbove: British 5.5 inch howitzer\nAbove Coehorn mortar from the Battle of Glen Shiel 1719 (base not original!)\nThese were designed to fire with lower propellant charges than normal guns.\nThe reason for this is that, for gunpowder rather than cordite propellant, the shock of firing was great and could be enough to cause the premature explosion of the shell, either in or just in front of the barrel. This occurrence was understandably unpopular with artillerymen!\nCommon shell could be fired from a gun using a reduced charge, but this was not usual practice in the Napoleonic era. A gun would be much heavier than a howitzer for the same calibre as it would have to be designed to withstand the higher pressure of the larger propellant charge.\nAlthough sometimes achieving great things e.g. the 1719 Battle of Glen Shiel in the second Jacobite rising where Coehorn mortars won the day sending the Spanish troops packing the shell fuzes were not very reliable producing a large number of blinds (duds) and both the timing of the fuze and the range setting needed accurate judgement- whereas if a normal gun was fired a hit might well be achieved as long as the line of the shot was right.\nFootnotes\nDolleczek A (1887) , Geschichte der Oesterreichischen Artillerie.

But we often only consider single shot cannons, as those were most useful for ships and sieges\nSingle shot cannons have a large blast area in front - see, for example, the images of modern-ish battleship salvoes) - that are very disorientating even when you stand outside of the main arc. The percussion wave is far more powerful than you expect; even with training, it is unnerving.\nThe single shots will go through many lines of men - regardless of armour. Imagine hearing a loud bang, feeling a pressure wave pass over you, and then seeing a swathe of your comrades just \u2018disappear\u2019. Not great for your morale - but awesome for the morale of the cannon\u2019s army!\nA cannon is useful if you have cavalry on your side. Footmen\u2019s best defence against cavalry is to form up into a tight formation - but this then leaves them very prone to cannon fire. To reduce the impact of cannon, footmen need to go into a loose formation - and then they are prone to cavalry charges. So by alternating cannon & cavalry, the footmen have to be constantly vigilant.\nSo, against footmen, cannons are morale weapons which are useful support for cavalry. But there were also other forms of cannon, not just the single shot cannons that we always picture", "Artillery is the \u201cQueen of Battle\u201d or the most casualty producing weapon on the battlefield. They scatter the attacking force and bury the defending force.", "\u201cHow are cannons ever effective in infantry warfare if they only shot steel/stone balls and can possibly only hit a few men? It\u2019s a very unfair effort to affect ratio.\u201d\nYou have a 24 pound piece of solid metal travelling at a high rate of speed. Do you think it suddenly stops, embedded in and killing the first man it comes to? No. It\u2019a not a modern .380 hollow point. It\u2019s a 24 pound piece of metal flying through the air, and it is aimed at a tightly packed group of infantry men six or eight ranks deep. That cannon ball could go through all eight ranks before expending all of its energy, especially if the men were not wearing any armor.\nAnd while it\u2019s tearing its way through the innards of four or five men, it is also tearing their bodies apart; throwing jagged chunks of bone and teeth and metal through the air and into the soft bodies of the other men around them. I would be willing to bet that more men were killed by the shrapnel generated by the missile than by the missile itself. That\u2019s a damned effective weapon.\nConsider a 12 pound cannon ball blasting through the stern of a sailing ship, travelling through the length of the ship through wooden partitions and anything else in its way. That missile may not touch a single man on its way through the ship, but every piece of wood it goes through (and 18th c. ships had a lot of wood in them) would be blasted into splinters. Lots of six to eight inch long sharp, jagged splinters flying through the air.

We already know how to do industrial scale carbon capture and sequestration. It isn\u2019t rocket science. The problem is that putting the capture equipment on a coal or natural gas source raises the cost of the plant 35%, and the energy required to compress the post-combustion CO2 sufficiently to force it into an underground reservoir a mile or so underground (which is shorthand for \u201cdeep enough to sequester the stuff long enough to matter\u201d) requires 40% of the output of the plant.\nThat 40% can also be described as increasing the cost of the power output from the plant by 40%. And since coal generation is already so expensive that no one is building any new coal plants, you can see how adding 75% (35% plus 40%) to the price of the power from a new coal plant won\u2019t get past the pencil stage.\nThis is similarly true for natural gas, and for existing plants which have already paid off their original construction cost, but are still struggling to remain competitive. The fact of the matter, which is extraordinary good news for everyone except people who can\u2019t think of anything to do other than to work at or own aging fossil or nuclear plants, is that in the last three years the cost of wind and utility scale solar generation has dropped so much that it is now cheaper to build new wind and solar just about everywhere in the world, than it is to continue using existing coal, natural gas or nuclear plants.\nAnd adding 35% or more to the cost of those old plants isn\u2019t economically viable. In most parts of the world the electric grid is dispatched on the basis of cost. There are a few other factors, but as everyone knows, superior efficiency has made natural gas a better option for power generation than coal or nuclear or petroleum products, and now natural gas has lost its lead to wind and utility scale solar (rooftop solar is another story - operates in a different economic context).\nThere are a few living examples that are close enough to real sequestration that we have high confidence in these costs. Some utilities take CO2 from coal plants and inject it into active oil and gas fields. This is called \u201cEnhanced Oil Recovery\u201d. Although they like to pretend it\u2019s the same as sequestration, it\u2019s not, simply because the formations which have been fractured and drilled are no longer capable of retaining the CO2 for the requisite several thousand years. And since the result of the practice is to bring more oil or gas out of the naturally sequestered state which made it a fossil fuel in the first place, there is no net benefit.\nAnother example is in the North Sea, where the oil and gas comes out of the sea floor with a lot of CO2, which is liquid at the depths they are drilling. Some of the oil companies have found a simple way to separate the liquid CO2 and pump it back into the sea floor. This eliminates the expensive and energy-intensive step of compression, and prevents a large, lesser known source of CO2. It is a benign process, but hopefully we can just shut the entire operation down pretty soon.\nThe last thing I think is worth mentioning is the process of using atmospheric or post-emission CO2 to make new liquid or gas hydrocarbons. The chemistry has been known for more than a century. What\u2019s new is that the electricity needed to hydrolyze water has become cheap enough that we can do this at an affordable cost compared to using fossil fuels. Search for Carbon Engineering. Interestingly, Carbon Engineering takes advantage of the fact that atmosphere and open water remain in balance as far as CO2 goes, and they extract their carbon from the same water they hydrolyze. I\u2019m not sure if their process is proprietary, so it may not be possible to tell much more about it from their website, but there are a lot of similar efforts. I refer people to this one because the website is pretty useful.\nWe don\u2019t have a mature industrial process yet. This is all too new, especially the potential to generate very cheap electricity from wind and utility scale solar projects. Processes like this will achieve their ultimate lowest cost when we have enough wind and solar to produce more power than is needed at a significant fraction of the time. For solar, this means we need to have more solar capacity than our total peak consumption at the time of day when all the air conditioners are running. In other words, at least eight to ten years from now if we are smart. For wind, we need to have at least about 70% of today\u2019s electricity coming from wind before we have enough excess to make the very cheapest renewable hydrocarbon fuels. There are a couple of other industrial chemical processes which are going to compete for that cheap power too.\nThe big problem is that taking carbon out of the air or water to make fuel isn\u2019t sequestration - unless you plan to pump the fuel into the ground and never use it.\nSo ultimately, the answer to your question is: we have it now, but we don\u2019t have a systematic process which has a remote promise of paying enough to do it on a scale that matters. All the biological processes are more likely to gain the funding than any of the mechanical/chemical processes.\nThere was talk about a new approach to making concrete which actually absorbed CO2 instead of being a source a few years ago. I\u2019m the sort of spoilsport who actually does the math, and I calculated that it would be possible to absorb all the CO2 we emit in a year with this new cement, if we built a full scale model of California out of it. One more time, I\u2019m not holding my breath.\nWe will first use dirt cheap renewable electricity to eliminate fossil fuels - not because it is logical, but because it is the economic pecking order. Efficiency continues to be cheaper than generation, but after spending 35 years trying to get people interested in saving six to ten dollars for every dollar they spend on efficiency technology, I\u2019m not going to kid myself or anyone else. People find wind and solar more exciting than efficiency. Rooftop solar is about two to three times as expensive as utility scale solar, but we still see about 30% of all our solar going onto rooftops. Maybe more in other countries. 60% of all solar panels in 2018 went to developing nations.\nSo I hope that some people will get serious about reforestation, reversing desertification and enhancing agricultural soil carbon content, while I spend most of my time trying to speed the rate of new efficiency, wind and solar. I see no economic pathway to full scale industrial sequestration, and if we can\u2019t get people to save billions of dollars every year with efficiency, what logical hope is there that we could get people to spend billions of dollars every year on industrial sequestration? It is a lot more reasonable to simply stop using fossil fuels (and nuclear power, which is too expensive to replace the existing plants, much less build a lot of new ones).\nThat is, in reality, what is happening. Not nearly fast enough, but at least we\u2019re moving in the right direction finally.", "How close are we to industrial-scale application of carbon capture?\nMechanical carbon capture is a total fantasy supported by the fossil fuel industry, but it is too energy-intensive to ever scale effectively.\nWhat hurdles do we need to overcome to get to this point?\nThe laws of physics.\nHow close are we to industrial-scale application of carbon capture?\nNatural carbon capture by plants is already being used at scale to capture carbon and by combining carbon capture with agriculture it will be possible to make a sizable dent in carbon emissions in combination with other solutions.\nRegenerative Annual Cropping @ProjectDrawdown #ClimateSolutions\nWhat hurdles do we need to overcome to get to this point?\nInertia and denialist morons.", "Damn close.\nThe US has millions of acres of land converted into a low intensity CO2 vacuum. According to NOAA, about 50% of US 2017 fossil fuel CO2 emission were vacuumed right back out of the atmosphere:", "Hopefully, never. This is the most dangerous idea; that CO2 is pollution and must be eliminated. This is the exact opposite of the truth; CO2 is the essential gas for all life on Earth, and is almost irrelevant to Anthropogenic Global Warming. This \u2018CO2 causes Climate Change (AGM)\u2019 is a lie put out by the billionaires and corporations that want to make trillions of $ from Climate Change (They say CC, but they mean AGW).\nThe Sun and air pressure are the two biggest causes of CC. Man has almost nothing to do with it. Man causes a lot of pollution, yes, but that\u2019s actual pollution - NO2, SO2, O3, CO, PM2.5 and PM10 - not \u2018carbon pollution\u2019, which is green ideology mixing with Leftist News-speak. CO2 is almost nothing too, and even if it were a player, 97% of CO2 is natural - only 3% is from Man. So, we\u2019re supposed to give corporations billions of $ to eliminate / reduce the 3%? If CO2 were a player, that would be a meaningless waste of money as the Earth will continue to make the 97%!\nIt\u2019s all about the money. \u2018Follow the money\u2019. Michael Moore\u2019s new film, Planet of the Humans goes into this a bit. The Greens are basically owned by Big Business making trillions off the whole renewables scam. Carbon Capture is just more of the same.

our lives at all, it is a gadget that has some features, for some people but not all people.", "Hi, I own an Apple Watch and I found that it was really cool at the beginning until the second month (sadly) :))\nI agree that Apple Watch is a good gadget to fill up our Apple collection and it can help us a lot in our daily life. For example, it reminds me to stand up every 60 minutes to exercise, gives me quick notifications without looking at my phone and real-time heart rate, or lets me answer my phone calls/text messages, sets reminder/alarms, etc. I had the feeling of being cared and things get more fluent with my Apple Watch. I can even transfer my music and connect to Airpods to listen independently without my phone. It also has its own Apple Watch App Store so I could buy some extra apps to monitor my daily habits better (drinking water, meditation schedule).\nHowever, the more I use it, the more I see that it only serves some certain groups of people with a specific lifestyle. Sometimes when I am too busy with my work, travel around then those healthcare features become useless, just like spam mails. I actually realised that knowing my current heart rate is not truly necessary when I do not do any physical exercises much in my working days. And if the noise level exceeds the safe threshold when my office is full of people discussing, talking in a meeting then what? Should I leave the room and find somewhere quieter or tell people that they are making noise? Obviously not something useful in this kind of situation. In addition, the battery is not a strength of Apple Watch although series 4 has better battery life. I have to charge it daily and if I forget to do it at night, it will probably run out of juice on the next working day. I guess most of us here are working people and you all have a job (similar to me to a certain degree), then that is the feeling of how owning an Apple Watch is like. That is why I think Apple Watch might appear to be outstandingly helpful for some people with a specific lifestyle.\nThose are my experience when using Apple Watch and how it \u201cchanged\u201d myself.

The pandemic is choking everything from parts makers to international shipping to manufacturing; it\u2019s unlikely Apple/Foxconn would be able to make normal quotas. And if they can\u2019t make enough, it\u2019s probably better to halt or slow production so that the product can be refined in the hiatus instead of shipping six months behind the curve.\nThere is also probably next to no market for $1500 phones now or well into the summer. Apple is both smart and egotistical enough not to launch a flagship product into what would be dismal sales totals.\nAnd finally, we\u2019re in a time when people are reconsidering their purchases and expenses and personal finances. Apple may not want to call attention to the fact that no one really needs next-week\u2019s iPhone at $1000\u20131500 when, like nearly all recent smartphones, it\u2019s hard to distinguish from the phones of ten years ago.

A DVR is basically a digital electronic device that converts the incoming video signal from an analog camera to digital, compresses it, and stores it.\nHow Does DVR Work?\nThe DVR and security camera are both connected to the power outlet via their respective power adapters.\nHow Does DVR Work?\nThe security camera, therefore, transmits an uncompressed video signal through the video cable back to the DVR video input port.\nWhat is NVR?\nAn NVR is a computer device which has a dedicated software that captures encoded streams from IP cameras, and archiving on a hard drive. Unlike DVR, NVR manages all its IP cameras through network.\nHow Does NVR Work?\nUnlike DVR which uses the point-to-point connection, NVR communication protocol is rather simple. The IP cameras only need to be on the same network in other to stream to the NVR. This is why network video recorder is more flexible.\nDifferences between DVR and NVR\nphysical difference between DVR and NVR\n1) One of the physical difference is that the DVR has RS485 protocol, which controls a PTZ or speed dome camera while NVR does not. The NVR\u2019s PTZ operation is done over the network and does not require any physical connection on the NVR.\nDifference between DVR and NVR\n2) DVR uses a coaxial cable for connecting to the cameras through a point-to-point protocol, but NVR uses Cat5, Cat6 cables, or wireless bridge.\nDifference between DVR and NVR\n3) DVR processes video data using its own digital signal processor, whereas NVR only stores the processed video data which has already been pre-encoded from the IP cameras.\nDifference between DVR and NVR\n4) DVR is used with analog or analog HD cameras, while NVR is used with IP cameras.\n5) The image resolution on a DVR is very limited, but the NVR can support a higher resolution.\nYAKASO Technology\nis a company that provides Home Security Cameras and Surveillance Technology Service.\n*Amazon: YAKASO @ Amazon.com:\n*Youtobe: YAKASO\n*Wordpress: PTZ Camera - YAKASO\n*Pinterest: YAKASO Technology (yakasotechnology) on Pinterest\n*Twitter: YAKASO (@YAKASO_Tech) | Twitter\n*Tumblr: Log in | Tumblr\n*Blogger: Blogger\n*Reddit: overview for YAKASO-Tech"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Liu Kai Bei", "view_list": [43, 81, 17]}, "911": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "name_list": ["Wilbert Frias"], "question_title": "Do people have enough knowledge about the latest technologies?", "topic_list": ["Latest Technology", "Future of Technology", "General Knowledge", "Information Technology", "Technology Trends", "Knowledge", "Computer Science", "Science", "Technology", "Computer Programming"], "no_of_view": "351", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [0], "ans_list": ["My boss does not know much about AI -he thinghs it can solve any problem magically- wich clearly is not -you end with an un-debug-g-able black box.

Therefore, many jobs are going to be automated and replaced by AI in the near future.\nRobots are really smart and have a low margin for error compared to humans. They can do many things better than humans. That is why so many jobs are being taken by machines. Machines are not only cheaper but they are less trouble also. As well, they wouldn\u2019t ask for a raise or slack around and they would work 24/7 nonstop with no complaining.\nHowever AI will never be able to replace all human jobs, but they will help employees to be better at some jobs which cannot be fully automated.\nThere are 02 reasons why they cannot be fully automated. The first reason is the limitations of AI. And the second reason is people don\u2019t practically accept robots for some professions because of the risks involved in AI.\nTherefore, some jobs will not be replaced because it is impossible to program everything man gets from nature into a machine. And some jobs will not be replaced because people prefer and trust humans over machines for those jobs.\nWhat jobs will NEVER be replaced by AI ?\nJobs that intrinsically require the person to be a REAL HUMAN, not just if it can replicate all the five senses of a human being and has the same or better cognitive and mental abilities as a human being, and appear exactly human. In other words, any job that requires the human brain and heart will NEVER be replaced.\nHumans are part of nature. AI is something not natural from the definition. So AI can never replace a REAL HUMAN.\nHowever, robots can replace everything which has a repetition of tasks, because they can be programmed to do so.\nWhen it comes to humans, they have the power of thinking which can never be programmed into a robot. Even to create a robot, you have to think first.\nRobots can never have this amazing power of thinking and creativity we people have. Therefore, some jobs can never be fully automated.\nHere is a list of 15 jobs that are unlikely to be replaced by a machine. They can all be assisted by AI in some way, but not completely replaced:\n1. Human Resource Managers\nAI can basically help to match job candidates with a certain job, interpret how candidates may work and get decisions. But in some cases, an applicant can look great only \u201con paper\u201d and still not work out. In this case, AI would simply help you get the wrong candidates for the job faster.\nIt\u2019s very hard to automate human management and development. They have to help employees and solve work conflicts. So human resource managers should have good interpersonal and reasoning skills to understand fellow humans better and think outside the box.\nTherefore, the human resources manager should be a human at the helm to manage interpersonal conflict with the help of non-cognitive and reasoning skills, which cannot be programmed into robots.\nSo robots will never be able to truly replace human resource managers. But AI will become an increasing presence that will help human resource managers.\n2. Computer Systems Analysts\nThe computer systems analyst is a computer-related job which is among those least threatened by AI. In fact, the more our economy relies on automation, there is a demand for computer system analysts who can implement and manage those systems.\nComputer systems analysts have to work in collaboration with others to review computer system capabilities, workflow, and scheduling limitations, review computer system capabilities, improve or automate existing systems and analyze user problems, procedures, and requirements. So that would make it near-impossible for robots to perform.\n3. Teachers\nThere are already a number of teaching aids available in schools and colleges. No matter how sophisticated these teaching tools and aids are, the role of the teacher is very crucial. They are real humans with values who inculcate a sense of belonging and ensure that wisdom is passed on.\nWe all have access to a lot of knowledge, but wisdom is the most difficult to obtain. It is easier to assimilate the knowledge when someone teaches and we always need someone to provide instruction and answer questions.\nAlthough basic teaching can be handled by bots, people prefer human interaction in teaching. That is where the job of a teacher becomes significant. Robots cannot provide that.\n4. Sportsmen\nIt would not be much fun to watch robots playing baseball. The idea of a robot gymnast is kind of pointless too.\nBeing an athlete essentially requires you to be human. That\u2019s what makes sports fun to watch, challenging to play and generally worthwhile.\nSports are all about what can or can\u2019t be achieved by the human body which robots don\u2019t have.\n5. Judges and Lawyers\nTheir jobs are mainly based on strategy, case analysis, and negotiation. Subjective knowledge and opinion based results are vital in their role.\nTherefore, the legal system needs people who can make sense of complex laws and argue on behalf of their client which cannot be achieved from a robot.\n6. Writers\nWriting is art. Putting thoughts into words is an extremely difficult task. Writers have to create and produce original content out of others\u2019 ideas, situations, or their imaginations.\nAlthough Machines excel at analyzing structured data, robots can\u2019t mimic the talent, creativity, and imagination of a good writer.\nAI can help with automated social media messages, writing prompts, title or headline suggestions, spot-checking for clarity, and plagiarism scan. But books, plays, and movies will always be written by humans.\nRobot\u2019s capabilities are limited to what they are programmed to do. They can\u2019t generate creative, innovative, and original ideas as humans.\n7. Chief Executive Officers\nChief executive officers have to motivate huge teams of people working for them, represent companies\u2019 objectives and missions, and inform broad strategy.\nAlso, human beings will always be comfortable to invest in companies which are run by human but not by a robot.\nAnd the job of chief executive officers is mainly based on leadership. It\u2019s nearly impossible to automate leadership. Because leadership is subjective, it\u2019s hard enough to teach it to machines.\n8. Event Planners\nEvent planners have to coordinate and negotiate with contractors, vendors, organizations, groups, and volunteers to make things come together.\nBecause of the organizational and people skills like creativity and coordination involved, this will make another impossible role to automate.\n9. Politicians\nDo you want your country to be run by a machine ?\nDo you believe that a robot will be just and fair and humane when deciding matters related to humans?\nDo you believe that a robot will empathize with you and care about you?\nPoliticians should have the capability and extreme versatility to handle any possible unforeseen scenarios to govern or rule over people. Robots don\u2019t do versatility very well.\nBecause emotions in politics are vital, having a machine with no feelings of happiness, remorse or sadness could not hold such a position in this world.\nTherefore, people will always be governed by people and so will machines.\n10. Magicians\nMagic is the art of producing certain effects with the help of supernatural forces with the sleight of hand, and almost the entire body. It is also an art of producing seemingly inexplicable results utilizing tricks.\nMagician is the person who is skilled in tricks or spells. The subtleties involved requires naturalism, polishing, & maximum rehearsal. You know what isn\u2019t natural ? It\u2019s Artificial Intelligence.\n11. Priests and Clergymen\nWill you listen to machines preaching you ?\nDo you like being baptized and married by robots ?\nNo one is going to listen to machines preaching us.\nPriests and clergymen are someone who have the power to guide and preach to their audience. They have to have faith, emotion, and empathy to inspire other people.\nRobots only function with evidence based on data and facts. These soulless buckets of metal have absolutely no concept of faith, emotion and empathy, which makes them not suitable for the job as a member of clergy.\n12. Psychiatrists and Psychologists\nBecause a robot has never been a human, how can it understand our emotions ?\nAs well, they can\u2019t communicate on the same level of a human conversation. Robots can never comprehend the problems within the human mind.\nAlexa and Siri can\u2019t even understand our search requests half of the time.\nDo we really want them to give us advice about our traumatic childhood memories from the third grade ?\nAlso, psychology is a profession, where human the touch is certainly preferable. Both psychiatrists and psychologists apply their behavior, learning, and expertise in mental health to help people succeed emotionally, behaviorally, socially and academically.\nRobots cannot help people with their mental problems. So it\u2019s quite impossible to have a robot psychiatrist or psychologist.\n13. Surgeons\nSurgeon\u2019s duty is more than just machines that take input and give some sort of relevant output. Although most routine surgeries can be fully automated but we will still need them to be supervised by surgeons.\nOf course AI will drastically change the field and make it better in many ways like prediction of disease patterns, faster and accurate diagnosis and so on. Although machines can assist in surgeries in many ways, surgeons are required to connect with the patient at many levels and robots can\u2019t do that.\n14. Occupational Therapists\nOccupational therapists treat disabled, ill, or injured patients though the therapeutic use of everyday activities.\nThey work with individuals who have conditions that are emotionally, developmentally, physically or, mentally disabling. Therefore, the profession requires human attention and interaction, which robots don\u2019t have.\n15. Professional Singers\nAI has been able to create and generate own music. AI will replace a lot of music players in the future because there are already robotic orchestras. But AI can never kill how fans feel towards their favorite singers.\nSinging comes from the emotions singers portray. Robots have no emotions. If they sing it will be monotonous and not pleasing to the ears. Therefore, robots will never have the human ability to perceive emotion in live performance.\nApart from these jobs, the jobs that create AI and robotics like robot manufacturing and maintenance, AI programming would probably NEVER be replaced by AI.\nConclusion\nAll in all, AI is still a very long way from having the range of human capabilities necessary for most types of work.\nRobots will never replace most jobs that require a specific combination of rational thinking, common sense, flexibility, manual dexterity, worldly and special knowledge, empathy, and communication skills.\nAnd people prefer and trust humans over machines for all jobs which require judgment, decision-making and, complex reasoning.\nBecause no machine can replace a REAL HUMAN, any job that requires the human heart and brain will NEVER be fully automated.\nSource: 15 Jobs That Will Never Be Replaced By AI"], "date_list": ["Apr 26, 2020"], "question_author": "Jiri Hejtmanek", "view_list": [247]}, "939": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 3, "name_list": ["Richard Werkhoven", "John Tibbott", "Eric Jones"], "question_title": "Has umbrella usage gone up or down in the last 10 years?", "topic_list": ["Umbrellas", "Environmentalism", "Sustainable Technology", "Climate Change", "Weather", "The Environment", "Economics of Everyday Life", "Cryptocurrencies", "Economics", "Technology"], "no_of_view": "1,212", "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0], "ans_list": ["Here is the market report:\nRain down\nUmbrellas up\n(sorry - couldn't resist)\nThe UK data:\nUmbrellas UK manufacturers' sales value 2018 | Statista", "I think it\u2019s gone down in the last 30 yrs or so.", "Up."], "date_list": ["Apr 27, 2020", "Apr 27, 2020", "Apr 27, 2020"], "question_author": "Diane Cestaro", "view_list": [326, 59, 126]}, "475": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "[Serious] What technology is more advanced than most people think?", "topic_list": ["Technology Trends", "Technology"], "no_of_view": "246", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Kris Craig", "view_list": []}, "1218": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "How will be the advancements in nanophotonics beneficial to the general populace?", "topic_list": ["Nanophotonics", "Photonics", "Nanotechnology", "Optics", "Technology", "Physics"], "no_of_view": "105", "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Rakesh Maity", "view_list": []}, "467": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "Are there any video settings where APAS 3.0 or FocusTrack are unavailable in DJI drone?", "topic_list": ["Phantom 3", "AR Drone", "DJI (company)", "DIY Drones (website)", "Personal Drones", "DJI Phantom", "APA Style", "Remote-Controlled Vehicles", "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Drones", "Videos", "Technology"], "no_of_view": "20", "create_time": "Apr 29, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Ayush Das", "view_list": []}, "300": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["John D'Adesky", "Calvin Hancock"], "question_title": "How far could we possibly go down the Earth with our current technology?", "topic_list": ["Technology Trends", "Earth (planet)", "Technology", "Hypothetical Scenarios", "Physics"], "no_of_view": "497", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "ans_list": ["The deepest we have gone is less than 8 miles.\nIt\u2019s just to hot for our current drilling equipment.

Do you have a charge controller or other regulator to prevent a surge in power from hurting the battery and keep the dark solar panels from draining the battery at night? A lot of equipment is going to be burned up, but it will be available. Wind power is even more complicated, unless you\u2019re one of the few power technicians living around a wind farm. They\u2019ll still need batteries, too.\nBattery maintenance is a hassle if you don\u2019t have maintenance free batteries, but there are many RVers who know it. But they\u2019ll have access to car batteries, golf cart batteries and other sources of energy. The challenge will be finding working natural gas plants or hydroelectric plants supplying power to the community in order to recharge them.\nGenerators are not a viable long-term solution for most people, because the fuel you need is going to be harder to get. You\u2019re competing with people for gas to drive vehicles or keep your lights on.

Generators need maintenance, too, and consumables like oil and air filters.\nRealistically, you\u2019re going to run out of ways to recharge the piles of batteries around you. And someone may kill you for that easy to use portable solar panel pack, because the alternatives are accidentally destroyed or just wear out. That will happen before most batteries have gone through too many recharge cycles to be effective, though you\u2019ll lose some to freeze damage.\nThen you\u2019re back to the really simple systems.

Or are we talking about the much more likely scenario where the world economy collapses due to climate change food shortages and economic collapse?\nIn the first case, you\u2019re basically limited to what you can scavenge, and as the store of new parts like batteries is exhausted, you are then limited to what you can make yourself. No doubt there will be skilled individuals that will be capable of building basic machines like alternators and batteries with bulk materials that will still be around for a long time. These people will become centers of power because of their skills, and will most likely become assets to be accumulated by others whose skills lie in the control of people. The more immediate skills in demand will be for farmers though.\nIn the second scenario, societies will contract as resources shrink. Some will implode due to lack of basic life support (water, power, food, communications), but some will stabilize and maintain a certain level of society. These cases will retain some manufacturing ability, enough at least to maintain the essential machinery that makes high density living possible.

Let\u2019s look at sales.\nOne can use IT to accumulate a lot of data around sales \u2014 number of phone calls made per rep per hour, average time delay between moving from marketing to sales funnel and initial sales response, average length to close by size of deal. I could go on and on. There are probably hundreds of metrics that IT could put the tools in place to gather. But the hardest part is the analysis.\nCompanies often talk about \u201cKPIs\u201d \u2014 Key Performance Indicators. But not all metrics are KPIs; in fact, most are not. In order to be a KPI, it both needs to be key (in that, it has a measurable, significant impact) and more importantly, it needs to be a performance indicator. In order to figure out which metrics are performance indicating, someone has to do a lot of analysis. Doing that analysis involves asking the right questions, making sure you\u2019re measuring what needs to be measured, and then doing math. IT often _could_ do this, but you really want a dedicated team. In the world of sales, these days this is often the \u201csales operations team\u201d. We\u2019re seeing SalesOps more and more, and I think it\u2019s critical for even small companies (even if the \u201cteam\u201d is only one person). It happens less often in other areas, but in order to drive positive change, it needs to happen.\nOnce you have data, and analysis, you need to communicate and motivate. It\u2019s up to management to determine how to motivate, but again, IT can help with communication. Say, an organization learns that every 30 seconds faster a response is given to a prospect who comes in from a web form results in a 0.5% increase in probability of closing a sale. Say, management decides based on this that they\u2019ll give a $2/hour bonus to any sales reps that respond to at least 5 leads per hour where the average response is within 1 minutes of the lead\u2019s arrival. [I\u2019m not saying these are either realistic, or good, they\u2019re just illustrative]. IT could generate a dash-board for all sales reps that starts a clock whenever they get a new lead. Or, lower pressure, just makes sure they get sent a text message when a new lead arrives.\nPositive organizational change is driven by good communication, and knowing what \u201cpositive\u201d means. IT helps most by enabling collection of the relevant information, and then enabling good communication. Sometimes, they can also help by doing analysis.", "It promotes, reinforces and safeguards an organizations behavioral discipline in terms of those who can be trusted and relied upon to do as they are told and not disclose information which could be contrary to its mission, vision and business objectives.

Ironically, this would be pretty similar to what Apple had going back in the PowerPC days. As others have noted, macOS would likely support both Intel and ARM CPUs for a while- similar to how it supported PowerPC and Intel CPUs for a while.\nWhether it will work out well or not, I guess we\u2019ll see. Apple is in a better market position now than it was back in the PowerPC days, and for sure ARM is more widely used than PowerPC ever was\u2026 so I\u2019d say it has a better chance for sure.\nOne potential issue in the near-term: right now, Macs can run Windows either directly (via Bootcamp) or virtualization. If Apple went to ARM CPUs on their Mac products, this would go out the window (no pun intended). There are Windows builds for ARM CPUs, but they have some pretty severe limitations. A lot of Mac users may not care, but some probably would.", "UPDATED:\nIt depends on if Apple decides to support both Intel and their own custom processor in parallel which they most certainly can do and do quite easily. The macOS operating system is highly cross platform and the App Store simplifies distributing compatible binaries. They already do this because iOS / iPadOS / tvOS are all based on macOS. If an application is written natively using the standard Cocoa / Swift libraries without a lot of custom 3rd party C/C++/Rust code or 3rd party libraries then a developer might only need check a box in Xcode to produce the ARM binary. Otherwise, they will have to prepare all that extra external code themselves. Adobe and Microsoft have already ported their code base over to being completely native so it should be easy for them. Most developers have gone through re-writes to become Apple native since the Carbon API\u2019s are gone and everything is now 64bit.\nIf Apple decides to support Intel and a new ARM CPU SoC in parallel then they can release a product early at the low end of the spectrum. Such as a new super thin and light MacBook. They could then improve their custom silicon over a long period of time until it is ready to replace more powerful Intel chips.\nAlternatively, Apple may just continue the R&D process until the processor is ready to compete with Intel on performance per watt. TSMC is close to 5nm production and AMD is at 7nm production while Intel is just starting to reach 10nm production with 7nm roadmap pushed to 2021\u20132029. TSMC fabricates Apple\u2019s Bionic ARM SoC processors. The smaller the nanometer scale the more transistors you can use and the less power it consumes and the faster it goes. On top of that, Apple\u2019s power management in the A13 Bionic SoC is remarkable, they can not only turn off major sections of the System on Chip they can turn off individual transistors within a section. Apple has been trying to go fanless for a very long time. They can do this in iPads and iPhones. I bet they want to do it in MacBooks too. The 12\u2033 Retina MacBook didn\u2019t have a fan but the Intel Core M CPU would throttle itself when it heated up. The new 2020 MacBook Air has a fan but the fan doesn\u2019t seem to be connected to a heatsink, heatpipe so I have no idea what the fan is actually doing, but it\u2019s not drawing heat off the CPU. The MacBook Air also temperature throttles. A CPU gets hot when it\u2019s working hard and if you don\u2019t cool it the processor slows down to cool off.\nSo if they can get the wattage way down but still offer performance on par with Intel or even considerably better. That is a major win. They pay quite a lot for Intel chips and producing their own CPU will save money. But making your own CPU also allows you to do very interesting things when you also control the operating system and development API\u2019s and your own system board designs. The engineering constraints placed on designing mobile processors do not apply when creating laptop and desktop CPUs. For starters, there\u2019s a lot more room and a lot more power available vs mobile designs.\nThe question is will Apple wait until they have something remarkably better than Intel or will they start out with something sub-par and build from there over time? I think they may just wait until all the pieces come together. No doubt they have prototypes in the works. They are waiting for the nanoscale fab production to be ready and perhaps some new battery tech is in the wings among other components and technology.\nImagine the possibility of a lighter and thinner MacBook Pro 16 / 24 core processor with a blazing fast GPU as well as ML / AI cores / T2 Security / H.265 Hardware Acceleration and say a 12\u201318 hour battery life would do to the laptop marketplace. Now that is Apple\u2019s style and Modus Operandi. They have the resources to wait and keep mum about things. It takes about 5+ years to design a processor. They have things in the pipeline they are working on. Timing is everything and a surprise is a very powerful thing. Apple has all the time in the world to get things right and they will pull the trigger when they are ready and not a moment before. Time is on their side. But nobody really knows for sure what\u2019s going to happen as Apple has always been very secretive and tight lipped. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen for a few more years yet. But I will enjoy the surprise when it happens.\nBloomberg has their opinion: Apple Aims to Sell Macs With Its Own Chips Starting in 2021\nARS: Report: Apple will begin selling Macs with its own processors in 2021", "<speculation>\nIf it happens, it will go mostly unnoticed, except for developers and some initial industry and media attention. And going mostly unnoticed will be deemed a success.\nIt will probably kick off in the form of lower end small MacBook, perhaps a replacement for the recently discontinued 12\u2033 MacBook line. Perhaps an 11\u2033 MacBook Air. Choosing this could conceivably be one of the harder aspects of the project.\nDevelopers will get an SDK to allow a new target for the new chipset. In most cases it will be simply a case of adding the new target to the project. They won't be allowed to override the use of deprecated APIs for the new target and there may be some other small changes needed to make it fully compatible.\nSoftware compiled for the new target will run natively on the new chipset. Older software will run (on the new chipset) via an emulation layer similar to Rosetta that was used in the PPC -> Intel switch. Most software will just work but some edge cases will have to adapt or pay back some technical debt.\nMore powerful Macs will continue to use Intel for now, perhaps indefinitely, perhaps until more powerful versions of the new chips are brought online.\n</speculation>\nmacOS and iPadOS will continue their overlapping trajectories, but retaining appropriate unique features of each.

It helps in monitoring real-time performance\u2014 all at a single place.\nApp center allows developers to connect the service to their GitHub repositories (as well as Visual Studio Team Service and Bitbucket). Developers can use the service to build their apps for the support platforms and then use the service\u2019s testing tools to run automated UI tests of their iOS and Android apps on actual physical devices. Once tested, developers can use the service to distribute their apps to the various app stores or to their internal and external beta testers using HockeyApp, which Microsoft acquired back in 2014.\nIn addition to these test and build services, App Center also allows developers to get some insights into how users interact with their apps, as well as crash reports when all the testing ended up missing a potential issue.

Because most buyers have been using a smartphone for at least a year and a half. The most fragile part of smartphones is its display. Ordinary glass screens easily fall out of hand and break. To get rid of this, for several years now, various mobile phone manufacturers have been using a type of glass called Corning Gorilla Glass on the display of smartphones, which can be much more disturbing than ordinary glass. #Gorilla Glass is powerful - even if you know it, how it works or the details about it are unknown to many. Let's find out what the thing is!\n#What is gorilla glass? Gorilla Glass is a special type of glass that is trademarked and manufactured by a US company called Corning Inc. The company was founded in America in 1851 as Corning Glass Works. The company later changed its name to Corning Inc. In addition to New York, there are two research centers with their glass in Japan and Taiwan. #The name Gorilla Glass seems to be due to the fact that the gorilla is strong. Honestly, gorilla glass doesn't break at all. However, it is much stronger than ordinary glass. The latest sixth-generation Gorilla Glass (6) was still intact after 15 consecutive drop tests from 1 m to uneven ground. Fifth-generation gorilla glasses fall from 1.8 m above the ground, but remain intact in 80 cases. Corning claims that Gorilla Glass 6 is twice as good as the previous generation. The company conducts numerous tests to ensure their durability.\nGorilla glass is technically a type of aluminosilicate. These are sand-based and chemical compounds composed of aluminum, silicon and oxygen. #After the glass is initially made, it is placed in a molten salt bath at a temperature of 400\u00b0 C. This temperature initiates a chemical process called ion exchange in which large potassium ions in the salt enter the glass and take up space by expelling the small sodium ions in the glass. As a result, the density of the glass increases a lot and this higher density gives the gorilla glass the desired durability. #Gorilla Glass was first made in 2006. Then in 2012, 2013 and 2014 it was upgraded in various ways. The fifth generation Gorilla Glass has been released in 2016. Gorilla Glass 6 came in 2016. They have also developed a type of glass called Gorilla Glass DX Plus for smartwatches. Gorilla glass is even being used in cars. Gorilla glass has also been used in the Samsung Galaxy S9 series. #Gorilla glass is made in a special process, but after all, it is actually glass. So gorilla glass can be recycled just like tens of thousands of glasses. Even considering its impact on the environment, it's just like window or bottle glass - separately not harmful at all.\n#Antimicrobial gorilla glass It is a kind of special gorilla glass that is strong and resistant to germs at the same time. The glass is being made to protect users from germs on various wearable devices and touch screens.# Gorilla Glass Protected displays on many devices, from smartphones to smartwatches.

conspiracies do spread, they do so more slowly.\nVery, very few people do a Google search on \u201cAuntie Sue\u201d\nIn contrast, Quora is about ideas: people are not looking for Fred or Auntie Sue - they *ARE* looking for ideas and content - such as \u201cIs there a connection between 5G and Covid?\u201d\nIf you care about that, and Goohglke it - you will get a Quora answer\nIf you are a troll (or a Russian agent) which is more productive: to fall ke a person in the hope someone sees them, and cares about their opinion on 5G?\nOr to fake a persion and post in a way that EVERY SINGLE PERSON who cares about 5G and Covid will see your nonsense?", "Everyplace seems to be ground zero for conspiracties about 5G and COVID.

Microsoft has stated that, \u201cTeams recently set a new daily record of 2.7 billion meeting minutes, up 200% from 900 million minutes on Mar 16.

For example, when sawdust used as a raw material, there is no need to crush the raw material, it is possible to reduce the investment of the crusher machine. Customers who are interested in investing in the charcoal briquette machine equipment can consult us.\nWhy the charcoal briquette machine so popular, is it a very promising development prospect? It can be said that the sales of charcoal making machine equipmnet are very popular now, and its environmental protection and energy saving. From this point of view, its development prospects are very good.\nReduce environmental pollution and avoid waste of forest resources, making the charcoal machine industry occupy an important position in today's society. The birth of the charcoal making machine industry has reduced the waste of forest resources. Charcoal briquette machine mainly uses straw, fruit shells, agricultural and forestry wastes as raw materials. Not only does it avoid waste, but it also allows waste resources to be reused.\nThe mechanism charcoal has many uses, and it is also an important reason for the good development prospects of the charcoal briquette machine industry. The machine-made charcoal can be used for barbecue food, no smoke smell, clean and hygienic, and can also replace coal for household heating. The machine-made charcoal has a greater calorific value than coal and is more resistant to burning. The mechanism charcoal can also be processed into chemical raw materials, can be made into activated carbon, silicon carbide, crystalline silicon, carbon disulfide, the use is very broad. For example, industries such as smelters, copper plants, steel plants, rubber plants, etc. require large amounts of machine-made charcoal, and the amount is very large. The mechanism charcoal produced by the charcoal making machine can also be used in daily life, such as mosquito coils, the mosquito coil factory requires mechanism charcoal to make mosquito coils.\nFrom the above description, the sale of machine-made charcoal is very good, so as a production equipment, charcoal briquette production line\nequipment is also very popular."], "date_list": ["Apr 27, 2020"], "question_author": "Amy Yan", "view_list": [22]}, "1011": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "Are your intimate moments recorded in Apple's phone?", "topic_list": ["Intimacy", "iPhone 6", "Moments", "Apple (company)", "iPhones (product)", "Apple Products and Services", "Technology", "Smartphones", "Survey Question"], "no_of_view": "92", "create_time": "Apr 27, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Anshul Gelani", "view_list": []}, "491": {"no_of_follower": 0, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "error", "topic_list": ["error"], "no_of_view": 0, "create_time": "", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "", "view_list": []}, "247": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["Geoffrey Holland", "David Plantz"], "question_title": "Ten years later, the world's first commercial handheld mobile phone, dubbed the Brick, went on sale for an eye-watering $3,995.

AI is all set to aid medical research as well since the data processing abilities are expanding and cause and effect identification is more accurate AI might become the propeller in finding the cause of cancer and a cure for AIDS.\nIBM is working on AI applications in chronic disease treatment\n. Already a lot of companies like Google and Intel are working on data collection software to get a hold of large amounts of data for certain specific medical researches.\nAutonomous Transports: Recently the World Economic Forum and The Boston Consulting Group conducted a three-year-long study in which they calculated and analyzed the impact of autonomous vehicles in the city of Boston, the findings of the study showed that a lot of people will prefer autonomous commutes by the next decade hence we should soon be ready for the sight of a car driving itself. Trucking companies are already feeling the need for self-driving trucks.\nConstruction and Infrastructure: AI can replace a lot of hazardous manual work in the construction industry, the construction industry is slow in adapting to changes hence a lot of scopes is there to include AI as of now, some developers have created 3D modelers for planning and designing of buildings and the internal components like plumbing and electrical systems but as now they are not very widely used. Drones are being used to capture detailed photographs of parts of buildings that are otherwise difficult to access.\nWaste Management: Smart trashcans can sense the level of garbage in them and then send the information to garbage collection authorities this can be done by linking AI to IoT. In Songdo(South Korea) people can tag different types of garbage with coded smart tags, which are read by an automatic waste disposal system. Since pollution caused by toxic waste plays a significant role in increasing the risk of cancer in children and also in countries like India a lot of lands is occupied by garbage heaps and dumps AI is the future of waste management and disposal.\nEnhancing the existing technology: Alexa, Siri, and Cortana are just babies and will grow up to become useful and responsible adults in a few years. Facebook is working with AI experts to make advanced facial recognition software. If you already feel that search bars are reading your mind, be prepared for more because Google is applying machine learning to make its search more personalized and specific.", "Artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is power presented by machines, in comparison to the physical ability exhibited by humans and other creatures.\nIn computer science Artificial intelligence (AI) investigation is defined as the examination of smart agents. Any device that comprehends its surroundings and makes activities that increase its possibility of successfully reaching its goals. Colloquially, the term artificial power this used when the device mimics cognitive uses that humans interact with different human brains e.g. teaching and problem solving. The range of AI is disputed. As machines develop progressively fit, occupations considered as incorporating power are sometimes expelled from this definition, the miracle called the Artificial intelligence (AI) influence, inciting the joke.

Designed by Igor Sikorsky and built by the Vought-Sikorsky Aircraft Division of the United Aircraft Corporation, the helicopter was the first to incorporate a single main rotor and tail rotor design.\nDesigner : Igor Sikorsky\nLeonardo da Vinci. Called the ornithopter flying machine, da Vinci\u2019s 1488 design was never built, but it is said to have inspired modern day helicopters, and there is a suggestion that it inspired Sikorsky.\nThe name helicopter is said to have come from two Greek words, helix (meaning spiral) and pteron (meaning wing), because the original idea was that the flying machine would gain lift from spiral aerofoils \u2013 but it didn\u2019t.\nPaul Cornu, A French engineer designed and built a helicopter and managed to get it to lift off in 1907 \u2013 officially making it the world\u2019s first piloted helicopter. It featured two rotor blades that rotated in opposite directions so that the torque would be canceled. Powered by a 24 horsepower engine, it had to be held in position by men on the ground and wasn\u2019t at all maneuverable, so all in all it wasn\u2019t a great success.\nFrench engineer, Etienne Oehmichen designed a helicopter with vertically mounted rotors that rotated in the opposite direction to large lifting rotors. He also developed a tail rotor later. His first helicopter success was in November 1922 with Oehmichen No. 2 that made history because it was used successfully to transport a person. In April the next year Oehmichen flew 360 m and 525 m, a record, and in May 1924 flew a closed circuit helicopter about one kilometer in seven minutes, 40 seconds. The same year he flew one of his helicopters with two passengers.\nWhile Oehmichen\u2019s helicopter designs were reasonable successful, the Focke-Wolf Fw 61 is commonly considered the world\u2019s first really functional helicopter. First flown in 1936, it was designed and developed by two Germans, Henrich Focke and Gerd Achgelis, a pilot. The frame of the aircraft was based on another that Focke had co-designed, the Focke-Wulf Fw 44, and it utilized licensed rotor technology that relied on a radial engine to drive twin rotors. A major breakthrough was the counter rotation of the rotors because this solved the puzzle of torque reaction. It also featured a small horizontal-axes propeller that was driven by the engine, to cool the engine when the helicopter hovered or flew at low speed. A second prototype was built in 1937 and the resultant aircraft went a step further by successfully executing an autorotation landing without the engine switched on.\nThere are at least two more inventors that definitely deserve a mention in the history of the helicopter, Stanley Hiller, Jnr and Arthur Young.\nHiller\u2018s claim to fame is that he made the first helicopter that had 100 percent metal rotor blades that enabled pilots to fly the craft at much faster speeds. He was also the pilot of the first helicopter to be successfully flown across the USA in 1949 \u2013 the Hiller 360.\nYoung, who worked for the Bell Aircraft Company designed a helicopter that was the first to have a full bubble canopy \u2013 the Bell Model 47.\nSource : A History of the Helicopter | Prime Industries"], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Apulo Naga", "view_list": [11]}, "198": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 6, "name_list": ["Thalbert McGinness", "William Mook", "Harry Parker", "Sanjeev Devarajan", "Frank Dell", "Brad Boynton"], "question_title": "Could green technology be incorporated into the oil and gas industry?

In his article, David explains why firms should understand the risks and issues with cloud and employ best practices for mitigating improving data security and control within cloud.\nLimitations of Cloud:\nDespite the many strengths of cloud (cost, scalability, and availability), it has various limitations, especially when it comes to data protection. Firms should build their data management plans with these limitations in mind and take appropriate measures to help mitigate risks. Following are a few limitations of cloud that are often ignored.\nThe Need for Connectivity\nCloud exists only with internet access. It provides employees located in Dubai or Denmark the ability to pull data from the network instantaneously, but none of them can do this without the internet.\nPower outages, cell provider connection problems, or ISP interruptions can all prevent such connections, and therefore restrict employees from using cloud-managed services or pulling data. Firms should put physical media backups in place as a redundant function that allows staff to perform certain core functions during internet connectivity outages.\nThe Security Risks of Public Cloud\nPublic clouds bring together multiple tenants who have their own access controls, but the data resides together with other clients of the cloud provider. If a hacking group breaches through the public cloud, then they have a gateway to all of the tenants. Private clouds offer the same scalability and accessibility with a reduction in multi-tenancy risk\nNot all Providers are Secure\nThe cloud sector has matured and undergone consolidation, but there still are clear market leaders and lower-tier players. Choosing a lesser-known cloud provider isn\u2019t a sound business decision given that market leaders offer value pricing, accessibility, and strong security. Searching for \u201cbottom dollar\u201d at the expense of trust and security isn\u2019t the way to go.\nBandwidth Constraints Persist\nSome companies avoid the cloud for various processes because the speed is too slow. If they\u2019re dealing with on-demand information access or giant files, then cloud may not have the requisite speed. Some internal-facing processes are fine with bandwidth delays, but if the problem affects the customer experience and employees\u2019 ability to help customers, then there\u2019s a problem.\nMitigating the Risk\nA deeper understanding of cloud\u2019s limitations provides IT with guidelines for using cloud services appropriately. Following are a few practices that can help companies get the most out of their cloud deployments.\nCreate a Formal Data Management Plan\nThe marketing and sales teams craft formal plans, and IT should follow suit. A formal plan means transparency and accountability about how the cloud will be utilized. It should specify how data is stored and protected, and how every employee can do their part to use cloud services properly.\nPlans should denote what types of data or processes should be paired with public, private, or hybrid clouds, and which ones can only be managed with on-premises solutions.\nOrganize the Data in a Central Location\nModern companies pull in data from dozens of structured and unstructured sources, from social media queries to sales data, and everything in between. Managing all of this data in cloud requires an understanding of how data will be interconnected.\nFor example, the sensitive personal customer data would likely be in a secured, private cloud, away from product data that might be in the public cloud. But how will these data points come together for usage in BI and other platforms? Organizing the data gives companies a chance to account for all data sources (so none are left exposed) and to extract maximum value from all of that collected information.\nTest the Plan\nMarketing and sales plans are testable. Did the department reach metrics? It\u2019s usually a simple case of reviewing the plan and then laying out results, along with making notes for improvements. The data management plan should include measurable and be able to function properly in real-world settings.\nFor example, the plan might include access control rules for every cloud platform login credential. Did every employee follow this procedure? Were employees sharing credentials with each other or outside vendors? Did the cloud provider meet its stated uptime guarantees? Were there any security breaches, and if so, how did the exposure occur? Armed with a plan and year-end metrics, IT can then see broader context into the company\u2019s data security and if there\u2019s a need for any cultural shifts to help protect information.\nBackup the Backups\nLimitations of the cloud\u2019s reliability and accessibility should push firms to bolster their backup procedures. Storage is cheap, and companies must put in place multiple redundant backups, from physical hard drives to additional cloud providers. If a breach or loss occurs with the primary service, backups ensure data can be actively \u201cswitched over\u201d with little or no loss of productivity or inconvenienced customers.\nCloud\u2019s limitations certainly do not mean cloud-based solutions aren\u2019t the best way to offer agility and global accessibility.

It was a unholy reunion of capitalism and the public budget cuts.\nDuring the 80s when China changed its economic model, it wanted to shed weight on the public sector ASAP. So budget cuts were everywhere. To recompensate for the shock, and to probe on possible routes of development, entrepreneurship was encouraged, even within the government and military. The police force and military were allowed and expected to make money for themselves to make ends meet. Kind of like after the fall of the Soviet Union, albeit milder.\nFast forward to the 90s. Traffic cams were introduced in China. When the dealers presented the cam system to the traffic police, long lacking in staff, advertising collecting fees on traffic violation without having to send anyone into the street, the police bought the idea immediately. One city spread to hundreds, as traffic cams became the de facto most lucrative business of the traffic police. Some dealers even installed the cams for free, in the most well hidden spots, in exchange for a cut in the tickets.\nChinese people hated these cams and learnt to avoid them. Till this very day, the most sold GPS in China have the feature of alerting the drivers of the whereabouts of the cams.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the police force to realize the traffic cams\u2019 value in surveillance in fighting crimes, and since China has a lower number of policemen per capita than most countries yet they\u2019re expected to have a higher percentage of resolved cases, the Chinese police quickly learnt to rely as much as they can on cams.\nThis trend finally went into overdrive, when the city of Chongqing embraced surveillance. To deal with a city long plagued by organized crime in the wild west of China, the Chinese Communist Party sent Bo Xilai, who would later run against Xi Jinping for the current Chinese presidency. Bo was supported by the police chief Wang Lijun, who was a undercover police hero in the underworld of the Northeastern Chinese border regions and totally understood the value of intelligence gathering. Under Bo and Wang, Chongqing exchanged experience with the US and later Israeli mossad, and built the first ever extensive surveillance system in China and it worked wonders. They successfully turned Chongqing from the wild west into one of China\u2019s safest cities, even livestreaming crime crack down on local TV around 2010.

Called the BionicOpter, the robotic insect can fly in any direction \u2014 even backwards \u2014 turn and accelerate quickly, hover, and glide without beating its wings. It\u2019s said to be the first aircraft that flies like a helicopter, plane, and glider.\nThe BionicOpter can fly forward, backward, hover, and glide.\nThe BionicOpter\u2019s lightweight construction, tight integration of components, advanced controls, and ability to move each of its four wings independently all contribute to its extreme maneuverability. The bionic dragonfly has a 63-cm wingspan, is 44-cm long, and weighs just 175 gm. The wings\u2019 carbon-fiber frame is covered with polyester foil. The structure is made of flexible polyamide and deep-drawn ABS terpolymer that\u2019s sturdy, but flexible and ultralight. And its small rib cage houses a 7.6-V LiPo battery, nine servomotors, and a high-performance ARM microcontroller, along with inertia, acceleration, and position sensors, wireless-communication modules, and other mechanisms.\nA motor in the bottom of the housing drives the four wings at a common beat frequency, which is adjustable between 15 and 20 Hz. Like a real dragonfly, the\nBionicOpter\u2019s wings can turn from horizontal to vertical. For this, servomotors individually twist each wing up to 90\u00b0.\nFour motors at the wing joints control flapping amplitudes. Linear movement in the wing root adjusts a crank mechanism to vary the deflection between approximately 80\u00b0 and 130\u00b0.\nMovements by the head and tail provide fine control. The dragonfly body is fitted with four flexible \"muscles\" made of Nitinol \u2014 a shape-memory alloy (SMA) that contracts when heated and expands when cooled. Passing an electric current through the SMAs creates ultralight actuators that move the head horizontally and the tail vertically.\nThe dragonfly\u2019s direction and speed are controlled with a smartphone.\nSoftware controls flapping frequency and twisting of the individual wings. Swiveling the wings determines thrust direction, and an amplitude controller regulates thrust intensity. The combination of the two lets the dragonfly hover, move backwards, and transition smoothly from hovering to forward flight. And unlike a helicopter, the dragonfly does not need to tilt to generate forward thrust. This means that it can fly horizontally as well as float like a glider.\nTo correct for any vibrations and ensure stable flight, data on position and wing twist are continuously evaluated in real time as the dragonfly flies. Inertia sensors measure the acceleration and tilting angle of the BionicOpter in space, while position and acceleration sensors detect speed and spatial direction.\nDespite its complexity, the aircraft is controlled with a smartphone or digital transmitter. The pilot inputs direction and speed, and an onboard microcontroller calculates operating requirements based on recorded flight data and sends commands to servomotors and actuators.\nThe BionicOpter was developed by Festo\u2019s Bionic Learning Network. Together with researchers at universities and development firms, the Network supports projects and develops test models whose basic technical principles \u2014 like energy efficiency and lightweight construction \u2014 are derived from nature. Among other recent developments: a SmartBird which models bird flight, robot arms much like an elephant trunk, and adaptable grippers based on a fish\u2019s tail.\nThese strategies, say Festo officials, can be applied to engineering problems in the industrial world. For example, the remote-controlled dragonfly demonstrates wireless real-time communication, a continuous exchange of information, as well as the ability to evaluate multiple sensor inputs and identify complex events and critical states. For Festo, the principle of continuous diagnostics helps ensure operational reliability and process stability \u2014 whether in bionic flying objects or everyday industrial machines.\nLikewise, industrial networks figure large in production systems of the future. Centralized plant control will give way to greater use of decentralized operations. Tasks that are currently performed by a master computer will increasingly be done by remote components. Festo believes this digital refinement will give rise to increasingly intelligent subsystems that can actively support production processes, thanks to capabilities like energy autonomy and condition monitoring \u2014 in the smallest of installation spaces. Festo says the BionicOpter illustrates such integrated functions and miniaturization.", "Robot dragonfly,\nThe TechJect Dragonfly is a wifi-enabled, super-small, smart and energy efficient robotic insect; it can do amazing aerial photography, aerobatic maneuvers for gaming, autonomous patrolling for security and surveillance, and much more."], "date_list": ["Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020", "Apr 29, 2020"], "question_author": "Velan Velan", "view_list": [50, 1, 53]}, "699": {"no_of_follower": 0, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "error", "topic_list": ["error"], "no_of_view": 0, "create_time": "", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "", "view_list": []}, "521": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "name_list": [], "question_title": "How do I reset my DJI drone to factory settings?", "topic_list": ["DJI (company)", "DIY Drones (website)", "DJI Phantom", "Factory Reset", "Remote-Controlled Vehicles", "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Drones", "Technology"], "no_of_view": "228", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [], "ans_list": [], "date_list": [], "question_author": "Cozma Dan Claudiu", "view_list": []}, "720": {"no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 2, "name_list": ["Surj Patel", "Jax Maximus"], "question_title": "How did the first audio recorders work?", "topic_list": ["Audio Recording", "Audio", "Invention and Inventions", "Technology", "History"], "no_of_view": "496", "create_time": "Apr 28, 2020", "upvote_list": [0, 0], "ans_list": ["Hi Bhavin,\nThe very first one displaced smoke residue on paper.

However, smartphones can fake the shallow DoF by software, but it\u2019s not nearly the same.\nBetter low light performance: due to the larger imager the DSLR can capture more light in a single photo. This allows for better low light shooting performance. Here some latest smartphones will offer night shot capability which will try to compensate for that flaw. However, it\u2019s not the same.\nAperture control: none of the current smartphones (except a couple of super-expensive Samsung models) has an iris. The lens aperture is one of the key parameters in photography. It is the main tool for DoF control in a image. It\u2019s not only just about the shallow DoF (which can be faked by smartphones) but it\u2019s about the precise amount of DoF as you want it.\nInterchangeable lenses: you can swap the the lens on a DSLR. The act of changing a lens re-purposes the camera to something completely different. You can use a super-telephoto lens for shooting wildlife or sports. You can use a fast lens for shooting low light. Or you can use a zoom which enables for fast and seamless framing on the spot. That\u2019s something smartphones try to mimic with their several camera modules. However it\u2019s fairly limited compared to the DSLR world.\nBetter ergonomics: it is much more enjoyable to use a DSLR with a proper grip and optical viewfinder for photography. In bright light composing an image on a smartphone screen can be difficult or impossible.\nBetter battery life: you can shoot pretty much the whole day and the battery in the DSLR will still have some juice. If you try the same with a smartphone (I did it) you will deplete the battery before lunch and you will desperately need to pause for recharge. This is not always possible when you are traveling.\nExternal flash: any DSLR can be upgraded with a powerful electronic flash, this device will enable many things. Among others, fill-in light in bright sunlight, to reduce harsh contrast. The other use would be professional event photography which can often happen in murky places.\nMacro photography: with a macro lens (and a macro flash) a whole new world opens up with a DSLR. You can shoot objects in 1:1 aspect ratio and beyond. This is impossible with smartphones.\nAstro photography: you can make wonderful shots of the Milky Way or the moon just by adding a tripod to a DSLR. Try this with a smartphone. You will be very disappointed.\nThere are probably a dozen more of advantages that I forgot to mention. Using a DSLR, or any other kind of purpose built camera, is a individual decision which will need some knowledge and education. Many smartphone users are upgrading to dedicated cameras while hoping to increase their image quality. However, this doesn\u2019t happen instantly, just by purchasing a expensive camera. Without proper know-how the images done with a fancy new camera will be a downgrade when compared to a smartphone. Just look around on Quora at all these silly questions regarding camera settings, basic functions etc. Most people don\u2019t even know there is a user manual or how to read something today.", "Robin Wells said it perfectly! It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Obviously a smartphone\u2019s camera quality isn\u2019t going to come close to a modern day DSLR. If you just want to take a few photos of friends and family or capture simple birthday parties that you will keep on your phone, then don\u2019t invest.\nNow if you want to print out photos or maybe pursue it as a side income, then invest in something that can produce higher quality images. The images produced by a phone are going to look amazing on your screen because smartphones are under 6\u2033. Blow those photos up printing them out and they will bad. Buy yourself a nice DSLR if you want to print! The reason is, most smartphones have lower MP. Cameras have an average of 24 MP which is the sweet spot for photographers!", "For me, the advantage of a DSLR compared to a camera phone is:\nspeed of first picture acquisition,\nspeed of subsequent picture acquisition,\nmanually controlled optical zoom in-camera magnification and cropping with full sensor pixel count,\nlooking at my subject through the taking lens without needing my reading glasses, not looking at the camera phone in my hand and needing my reading glasses.\nThose are important differences to me.\nAlternatively, when I am on a walkabout, I have my camera phone in hand and at the ready because I know it is slow to get ready and respond, and I need my reading glasses to see my camera phone.\nIncomparable advantage of a camera phone for me is super close focus, close working distance.\nA camera phone is also convenient as a threat when crossing the street, I hold it taking a video of oncoming traffic to warn drivers that I am recording their license plate should they try to run the crosswalk while I\u2019m crossing - people generally do stop, though \u2026 after gunning it a bit when they first see me, then slamming on their breaks when they see the camera phone pointed at them.\n- - - - -\nIn response to others:\nCamera phone presentation results illustrated above.\n- - - - -\nMost of my 17 x 11 \u201c prints are from 5 megapixel sensors, because, hey, that\u2019s the image source I want to present.\n- - - - -\nAnd it\u2019s qualities, not quality.\n- - - - -\nMost camera phones I see are way more expensive than any DSLR I\u2019ve ever bought.\nWhat we see on camera phones are only TTL through the taking lens \u2026 and OTS off-the-sensor.\nMany DSLRs offer TTL capability only, while not displaying any OTS off-the-sensor information for the photographer to take into consideration.\nAnd I use my DSLR in\n[ P ] mode,\n[ Professional ] mode,\n[ Point-and-shoot ] mode\n\u2026 why wouldn\u2019t I?\n\u201cWorld\u201d wise, there are a billion or more camera phone pictures taken daily, not so much DSLR pictures.\n- - - - -\n\u201c\u2026 Far superior quality!

If you were to go up to that billboard then you will see how low resolution the image is. Driving by it looks like a clear photo.

Far superior flexibilty.", "Well really it is not a smartphone world, well it is for a multi-purpose device that happens to work reasonably well as a camera. The only benefit the smart phone camera has, and it is huge, is the convenience factor.\nNothing more.\nThere is nothing any smartphone can do that will even come close to an entry level DSLR in image quality. Now most of the limitations of the smartphone camera are due to limitations of physics in the areas of optics and light. You can not change those and even Google admitted they had gone about as far as they can with sensor technology and lenses for that size, so where they are pushing ahead is with the onboard computer and computational photography.\nThey know that they can not compete in sharpness, distortion levels, color depth, dynamic range, low light performance or resolution so they work on areas they can control.\nThe problem with the lens is simply pure physics and optics, larger lenses perform better - if you look at all the higher quality lenses they are much larger, heavier and more expensive (a good lens cost more than the entire smartphone). For sensors - the larger the pixel, all else being equal, generally the better the performance. Due to the small sensor size in a smartphone this is a factor working against them - and if they increase resolution it gets worse.\nBottom line - they smartphone is convenient and those who take snapshots for social media will love them. Easy to use, the computer does it all and no real knowledge of photography is required. For those who are avid photographers or professionals they will always want more to enable them to do more and better. Smartphones are great and they do the job for the casual photographer and even professionals use them when they have nothing else - they are convenient. But equal to a DSLR? Not even close to an entry level model.\nSo back to your question on advantages.\nLower light performance - far more control over ISO, aperture and shutter speed (almost every smartphone actually has a fixed aperture, lenses which can create very shallow or very wide depth of field (the smart phone due to the extreme short focal length can not do a short depth of field and provide bokeh effect - although the computer can fake it and add it it) - fast shooting speeds - larger buffer - higher resolution - far greater dynamic range - far more options on lens focal lengths - far superior lens optics - the list goes on and on.", "The single advantage is that you will have the ability to take much better pictures than with a smartphone.", "I\u2019ve said this before.

SSD drives.\nA bit pricier per terabyte, but higher read/write speeds, albeit limited to the performance of the USB bus they\u2019re connected to.", "To some extent, it depends on what port on your computer you will use to connect to the drive. A USB 3.1 Gen 1 port is limited to 5 Mbps clocking on the wire, while the data rate is limited to 4 Mbps. That\u2019s theoretically 500 MB/s, but in practice the maximum you\u2019ll likely get with any drive is a bit over 400 MB/s. To get that speed, the simplest way is to use a fast single SSD, such as the Samsung T5 shown in Paul Hugenberger\u2019s answer.\nIf you have a USB 3.1 Gen 2 port, the clock rate increases to 10 Mbps, and the data rate is 9.7 Mbps (more efficient encoding). The maximum practical rate with this interface is over 1000 MB/s. The Samsung T5 is a USB 3.1 Gen 2 device, and can write at up to 540 MB/s using that interface - a significant bump in performance compared to USB 3.1 Gen 1. This is about as fast as any drive can do if it has a 6 Gbps SATA drive internally (as the T5 does).\nHowever, there are some small USB-interface SSDs that have internal NVMe drives which are even faster. The Samsung T7 is an example. Using a USB 3.2 interface operating at 10 Gbps, the T7 will read and write at 1000 MB/s or more. (Although USB 3.1 Gen 2 is also capable of 10 Gbps, USB 3.2 has two different modes capable of 10 Gbps, and the T7 data sheet doesn\u2019t say what the transfer rate is when connected to USB 3.1 Gen 2). The T7 isn\u2019t the fastest of these drives either; SanDisk, LaCie, Lexar, and Crucial all sell competing products.\nOn the other hand, if your computer has a Thunderbolt port, it is capable of 20 or 40 Gbps data rate, and there are higher-performance drives designed for that. For example, the Samsung X5 specs say it will read and write at 2800 and 2300 MB/s.\nIf you need large amounts of space at the lowest cost, you can also get multi-drive RAID arrays based on rotating disks that will have similar transfer rates to the SSDs above. But they will be much larger, and also have much worse random access performance than the SSD.", "If speed is your concern, I\u2019d say go for an external SSD instead of an external HDD. By nature, an SSD is faster because it doesn\u2019t use any disks which can wear over time compared to an HDD.\nHowever, this also depends on your budget too. Because an external HDD is far more affordable compared to an SSD, which can truly cost you a fortune. But whatever floats your boat then go for it.\nEach external SSD or HDD also has their own set of features and additional add-ons too.

In fact in my bathroom, I have right now a very important one such implement. Fortunately I do not require its services all that often, but nevertheless it is there if I need it. The tool in question is pumice stone and is formed when sea water and lava mix together. As for how to use this item, I copied the following from Healthline website:\n\u201cTo safely exfoliate your skin, you\u2019ll also need a large bowl or basin of warm, soapy water. This is especially important for exfoliating your feet or hands. If you want to use a pumice stone on your elbows\n, face, or neck\n, consider using this stone while taking a shower.\nOther accessories you need include:\nsoft towel\nmoisturizer\n(cream, lotion, or oil)\nmoisturizing socks (optional)\nbristled brush to clean the pumice stone\nStep-by-step instructions\nThese instructions will help you to properly remove your rough skin\n. If you begin to experience pain or irregular symptoms, stop using the pumice stone immediately.\nPreparation\nGather all of your materials in one place. Make sure that your stone and water are clean.\nSoak your dry, callused skin in warm water for 5 to 10 minutes. This will help to soften your hardened skin. Add soap or an oil to your water for extra softening and to increase moisture. If you\u2019re using a pumice stone on your elbows, knees, or face, complete this step in a warm bath or shower.\nUsing the pumice stone\nWhile you\u2019re soaking your skin, also soak your pumice stone in warm water. Never use a dry pumice stone on your skin. A wet pumice stone will glide across your skin easily and will reduce your risk of injury.\nRemove the target area from the soap bath and pat dry with a towel. If your skin is still rough, soak for a few more minutes before patting your skin dry.\nRemove the pumice stone from the warm water and apply it to your skin.\nRub the abrasive side of the pumice stone over your skin in a circular motion with light pressure. Massage your skin for two or three minutes. If your skin begins to feel sensitive or sore, stop immediately because you\u2019re most likely using too much pressure.\nFor your feet, focus your attention on your heels, the sides of your toes, and other dry areas you recognize.\nContinue rubbing the pumice stone on your skin until you\u2019ve removed the dead skin and revealed softer skin underneath.\nAfter two to three minutes of light rubbing, rinse your skin. If you still see patches of dead skin, repeat this process. Also, rinse your pumice stone for every session to keep the surface clean.\nYou can repeat this process daily or a few times a week to maintain soft, supple skin.\nFinishing up\nWhen you\u2019re done, apply a moisturizer or oil to your skin to maintain moisture and keep your skin soft. For a boost, put on moisturizing socks after moisturizing your skin.\nClean your pumice stone after every use. Under running water, use a bristle brush to scrub dead skin off of the stone. Apply a small amount of soap to make sure it\u2019s clean and free of any dirt. Bacteria can grow on the surface.\nDo not share your pumice with other people. Each family member should have their own.\nAllow the stone to dry on its own. Set it in a dry area away from moisture to prevent bacteria growth.\nFor deep cleaning, boil your pumice stone in hot water for five minutes. Allow it to air dry away from damp areas.\nYour stone will wear down over time, becoming too smooth to remain effective. If your stone becomes too small, smooth, or soft, replace it.\u201d\nSo there you have it, some of us at least are still living in the stone age.", "The end of the Later Stone Age took place when groups adopted technologies such as metallurgy to replace the use of stone tools. This process happened at different rates. The Clovis Mammoth Hunters are the earliest known group of Stone Technology people in North America, and the Folsom (both in New Mexico) people hunted with a revolutionary weapon called the atlatl and stone dart. Clovis points tend to be thicker than the typically thin later-stage Folsom points. Archaeologists' most precise determinations of the radiocarbon age is equal to roughly 13,200 to 12,900 calendar years ago.\nClearly the native American nations were still in the technical \u201cStone Age\u201d before white contact in the 15th century. The reintroduction of horses to the Native Americans of the North American plains (essentially a Stone Age people at the time of European contact) revolutionized their entire culture, and the consequences may be used as a window into the past.\nNational Parks Service\nFor centuries the Native Americans had fought among themselves in a conservative if seemingly inhumane manner using knives, clubs, and tomahawks made of wood and stone. The bow and arrow of the eastern woodland Indians of North America was unsophisticated and technologically inferior, not only to those developed by European and Asian cultures, but also to those found in South and Central America. Yet it was sufficient for hunting and making war. The Indians shifted from traditional weapons to firearms as quickly as they became available, but it has been pointed out that the Indians \"never really mastered the white man's weapon.\" [i]\nNative Americans did not always have the bow and arrow. Research suggests that it was not until about 500 AD that the bow and arrow was adopted in Iowa \u2014 some 11,500 years after the first people came to the region. Primary benefits of the bow and arrow over the spear were more rapid missile velocity, a higher degree of accuracy, and greater mobility. Projectile points like arrowheads also required substantially less raw materials than spear heads. A flint knapper could produce a large number of small projectile points from a single piece of chert or flint. A general rule of thumb is that a stone arrowhead will be less than 1 1/2-x-3/4-inch in dimensions and will generally weigh less than one ounce. Larger \"arrowheads\" probably would have been spear, dart, or knife tips.\nThese blades found near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay turned out to be 22,000 years old.\n[Note and Update]: Prehistoric humans may have harnessed fire to make sharp stone blades, say archaeologists who have recreated ancient fire-hardened tools dug up in South Africa. The rock was transformed after spending 5 to 10 hours buried beneath a fire and at temperatures between 250 and 300 \u00b0C. Heat treatment makes the stone harder, stiffer and more brittle, and it makes it easier to flake. Flaking is the process of chipping sharp, small pieces off a large rock. These adaptations were part of a \u201ctool kit\u201d that modern humans took to other parts of the world. Read more: Earliest fired knives improved stone age tool kit\nThe original native tomahawk was a very different instrument from that commonly known today. Iron and steel edged weapons were a European innovation. The native version was about thirty inches long and a large knob of wood or stone did its lethal work by smashing the body of the enemy. The head of the weapon might actually be the solid root ball of a small tree pulled from the ground, trimmed of its roots, and left with a portion of the trunk cut and thinned to an appropriate length and thickness to act as a handle. The whole weapon was usually scraped smooth and carved with simple decorations. A chipped stone was sometimes embedded in the root ball to make an effective puncture weapon. Clubs were also made from stone triangles and rectangles without grooves (a.k.a. a celt) that were tied or jammed into a handle, or from an oblong stone with a full or partial groove pecked or ground around it that was used for firmly attaching a handle (hafting). The gunstock tomahawk \u2013 so named from its resemblance to that part of a musket \u2013 was made of wood with flint projections and probably developed independent of Indian exposure to the white man\u2019s weapon.

The marketing category is easily the fastest-growing of all, having already reached a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 29.3% between 2010 and 2018. The second- and third-fastest growing global AI patent categories between 2010 and 2018 are AI-based digital security (23.4% CAGR) and AI-based mobility (23% CAGR).

Cloud platform providers Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and others are setting a quick pace in the global race for more patents and IP. Each is focusing on developing a suite of AI-based services that can scale across as broad of a spectrum of code development, use cases, and platform extensions.

(I tried, but the change didn\u2019t take.) The question is: Can medical research be sped up? How?\nInvention on a timeline defies research reality. As an applied research professional in the corporate world, I was always baffled by the requirement to invent on a schedule. The whole reason you\u2019re conducting research (rather than development) is that the answer to the research question doesn\u2019t yet exist. What will solve the problem that you are endeavoring to address in your applied research? Regardless of how many times we would not have a successful breakthrough by the deadline, managers persisted, as if those artificial deadlines would somehow drive us to that Eureka! moment more quickly.\nAdding staff beyond a team of experts does not result in a linear reduction of the timeline. In a groundbreaking work, Fred Brooks\u2019 The Mythical Man-Month tapped managers on the shoulder to let them know that you cannot double the staffing and expect the work to take half as long\u2026 that\u2019s in development projects as well as research (which is even more unpredictable). Brooks was addressing this problem in the domain of software engineering, but it applies in many disciplines. It\u2019s not that adding staff is a waste of money and effort but that the increase in staff has the cost of more supervision, coordination, and cooperation. All of that takes time away from the actual research.\nExample: Finding a successful vaccine for SARS-cov-2. Currently, we have research teams around the world looking at possible vaccines for the SARS-cov-2 virus. As of 28 April 2020, a research team at Oxford has a promising vaccine; it shows evidence of being effective in monkeys. [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/world/europe/coronavirus-vaccine-update-oxford.htm\n] Colleagues around the world will not halt their research because it remains to be seen what the effectiveness of this candidate vaccine will be on humans and what shows up in large-scale trials that didn\u2019t show up in initial small-scale trials. Here\u2019s where having more researchers addressing the problem is essential\u2014 not to speed up the research as such but to ensure that the research provides not only a viable solution but a consistently effective solution.\nIndependent teams, working in parallel, are likely to lead to a solution faster than if all teams pursued the same hypothesis (of which drug(s) will be most effective). That might seem counter-intuitive. In this kind of medical/pharmaceutical applied research, there is a combination of cooperation and competition: The glory goes to the team that finds an effective solution, but it\u2019s unlikely that a research group is going to succeed without learning from what other teams are finding. In a race against a death-count clock, there is a strong motivation to have some degree of information exchange. Scientists are working as quickly as they know how (I\u2019m quite sure!) without compromising the basics of research protocol, which include demonstrating repeatability of trials and outcomes. Ideally, it is other labs that conduct some of the additional trials. Responsible countries will do additional evaluation and review the existing trial outcomes, paying attention to side effects. Are the findings of Oxford University\u2019s Jenner Institute going to make it all the way to government approval of their vaccine? Is it cost effective to manufacture and distribute globally? In applied research, these considerations are all part of the set of constraints on the problem\u2019s successful solution. Meanwhile other teams must continue to look at alternatives so that if the Jenner Institute vaccine does not end up to be a solid solution.\nCan medical research be expedited? At which stage might there be government and social pressure to release immature findings? Will this lengthen the time to the discovery and validation of a successful vaccine?", "By not systematically devaluing and underfunding it!\nSee I ran the White House pandemic office.

Not merely remasters, but full fledged remakes. Of course remakes have happened in the past, frequently even. But now remakes have become both massive sellers and critically acclaimed. And the pace of them has certainly picked up.\nResident Evil 2 did the exact opposite of every video game trend that proceeded it. Unlike The Witcher 3, Resident Evil 2 used a very tiny map, the player could traverse the entire map in a matter of minutes. Unlike Fortnight there was no multiplayer, it was strictly single player. Unlike Skyrim the crafting system was incredibly basic and completely unchanged from the original. Unlike Overwatch there were no lootboxes, or even any microtransactions. The narrative DLC was given out for free and the only other DLC that exists for the game is just a few pre-order bonuses.\nResident Evil 2 is essentially the anti-2010s video game. And people loved it. The sales were great, outselling the original game even. And on top of that, it was critically adored. It won multiple critics awards, it was nominated for Game of the Year at the Games Awards.\nLikely in five years we will see Resident Evil 2 as a pivotal moment in the next phase of video game trends.\nShortly after Resident Evil 2, Nintendo released The Legend of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening. Which was a remake of an old, but much beloved, Gameboy game. The game was hailed for its adorable graphics. And it also did remarkable sales.\nAnd, of course, only a few weeks ago Capcom and Square Ennix released the remakes of Resident Evil 3 and Final Fantasy VII almost right on top of each other. Once again both games were very positively received by critics and both games saw amazing sales.\nI predict that a lot of old games will be dusted off and remade in the next few years. It\u2019s clearly already happening and I think it will only speed up. And I think a lot of those games will sell very well. In fact, I think they might even save the market from heading into a crash.\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that the industry has become extremely bloated on cash from microtransactions. And that the big publishers in the 2010s had all but abandoned certain market segments, most notably single player games, in order to quadruple down on the whales who buy things like loot boxes.\nPart of why people are loving these remakes is that in order to stay true to the original games, all the unpleasant elements that have become synonymous with the industry have been stripped out. The grind designed to get you to buy XP packs: gone. The microtransactions to buy cosmetic changes: gone. A 14-year-old kid screaming racial epithets at you: gone.

It can do more than just tell the time.\nThis is an easy decision folks. You know how customary watches simply tell the time and perhaps the date and year yet that is about it. All things considered, that won't be simply the situation on the off chance that you get a smartwatch. A smartwatch offers numerous highlights. You can get notices, answer to messages, set an update, get or dismiss a call and considerably more.\n2. Endless customisation options are available.\nOne of the fundamental highlights that smartwatch proprietors like specifically is the way that there are many customisation alternatives accessible. Nowadays, smartwatches accompany variable wrist bands. In the event that you believe that is all, let me disclose to you a large portion of the smartwatches come in various shapes, sizes and structures to browse.\n3. Because it does not need any batteries.\nMost typical watches despite everything have batteries and when the batteries pass on you need to get new ones. This appears a significant errand since everybody doesn't have the opportunity to go to the market and purchase new batteries and get them to work. That is the place smartwatches have an unmistakable bit of leeway. Indeed, you got it right. Smartwatches\nare rechargeable battery-powered these days which is a seriously cool component.\n4. It is great for carrying out mundane activities.\nAnother cool element that a smartwatch has is that they get associated with your smartphone. You can get notifications, type out straightforward short messages, set an alert or even set an update. There are a large group of things that you can do and tinker with. They resemble small PCs that are there to make your life much simpler.\n5. They are best for keeping your butt off the couch.\nIt does not shock anyone that smartwatches have begun concentrating on wellness so as to keep things applicable. Most smartwatches accompany a movement following sensor, a pulse screen, rest tracker and substantially more.

But its impact on healthcare is truly life-changing. With its ability to mimic human cognitive functions, AI is bringing a paradigm shift in the healthcare industry.\nWith AI, Health systems are able to deliver truly proactive, predictive healthcare.\n1. AI-powered predictive care: AI and predictive analytics help us to understand more about the different factors in our lives that influence our health, not just when we might get the flu or what medical conditions we\u2019ve inherited, but things relating to where we are born, what we eat, where we work, what our local air pollution levels are or whether we have access to safe housing and a stable income.\nAI assists healthcare systems to anticipate when a person is at risk of developing a chronic disease, for example, and suggest preventative measures before they get worse. This development has been so successful that rates of diabetes, congestive heart failure and COPD (chronic obstructive heart disease), which are all strongly influenced by SDOH, are finally on the decline.\n2. Virtual healthcare bots: Healthcare apps will act as a personal health assistant. They will also be used to provide medication alerts, and human-like interactions will also be possible. AI as a personal assistant will also help in assisting the patients when the clinical personnel is not available.\n3. Diagnostics: Another important field in healthcare which is using AI is radiology. AI systems can help with diagnostic processes. It can examine medical images like X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, etc. and can provide feedback on what it thinks a human eye can miss.\n4. Networked hospitals, connected care: Centralized command centres analyse clinical and location data to monitor supply and demand across the network in real time. As well as using AI to spot patients at risk of deterioration, this network can also remove bottlenecks in the system and ensure that patients and healthcare professionals are directed to where they can best be cared for or where they are most needed.\n5. Better patient and staff experiences: AI-powered predictive healthcare networks are helping to reduce wait times, improve staff workflows and take on the ever-growing administrative burden. The more that AI is used in clinical practice, the more clinicians are growing to trust it to augment their skills in areas such as surgery and diagnosis.\nPerhaps most of all, I believe we must keep in mind that AI\u2019s most powerful use is to enhance human capabilities, not replace them.\nTechnostacks is here to help you leverage the latest AI services that the industry has to offer.
