Do you have doubts that maybe the baby isn\u2019t yours?", "I\u2019ve been together with my girlfriend for about six months and we found out about five weeks ago that she is pregnant (about 10 weeks pregnant now). Our relationship was going really well before all this happened. We were doing really fun things together and told each other that we loved each other, I even thought that she might be \u201cthe one\u201d (cheesy I know). I still kind of think she\u2019s the one but really struggling with this. About two weeks after she found out she was pregnant she started getting cold feet and saying she was worried that since our relationship was so fresh that we will have to start being together by necessity and not choice. She said at one point pre pregnancy she figured we would be moving in together but now she feels like we have to move in together. All this made complete sense to me, at times it was hurtful but I was very understanding.\nShe has an ex-boyfriend who she was very close to and still is. Prior to the pregnancy there were a couple times that they had met up while we were dating, things like picking him up from the airport and giving him a ride to get his car from the tow yard. I thought it was weird and brought up that I felt that way so she said \u201cLook we\u2019re just friends and we\u2019ve been through a lot together, you just have to trust me!\u201d I love her and I believed her at that point. At one point while they were dating she had an abortion and it ended really messy between the two of them.\nThroughout the five weeks knowing she is pregnant there have been a lot of ups and downs. When we went to the ultrasound (two weeks ago) she said she told her ex-boyfriend that she was pregnant. Apparently he was really upset but she said telling him had helped her feel more comfortable with everything. Last week I was over at her house cooking some food on the kitchen table while her phone was charging. Her phone lit up and it showed she had five unread text messages from her ex. Then as she came back in the kitchen he called her and she was quick to ignore the call. When I was leaving that night I asked her when the last time she saw him was. She said \u201crecently, a week and a half ago when I told you I talked to him about being pregnant.\u201d \u201cWhat do you guys do when you\u2019re together? How often do you see him?\u201d \u201cA couple times a week. Go to the park, go on a walk. He is my best friend but nothing is going on.\u201d \u201cThen why did you lie about it?\u201d \u201cI just didn\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d I went home and slept on it and called her the next day and said I didn\u2019t feel good about lying and my trust has been broken so I need to know what happened. After some prying she had told me that she went over to his house three times, I identified one of the days as a day that she told me she went for a solo hike. It was also more recent than the date that she told me so she was back pedaling. She said it wasn\u2019t my business and that\u2019s why she lied about it. She stated nothing physical happened except hugging and cuddling. I kind of believe her in my gut but am really concerned about the lying about her whereabouts. Apparently he was crying in his bed and she held him but \u201cnothing sexual.\u201d No kissing on the lips according to her. She\u2019s told me she still wants to be with me and knows that the relationship between he and her is inappropriate but that she never cheated. She doesn\u2019t believe that she\u2019s done anything irreparable to our relationship. She also stated that she was not seeing him often at all before she found out she was pregnant because \u201cour relationship was going so well.\u201d\nI love her and want to forgive her but am totally split and having a hard time justifying this. If I did leave her, I would definitely still be the best father I can be. If I didn\u2019t leave her, will I be able to get over this trust issue and what can be done to resolve it?

The reason for this statement that both me and my friend have had experience in distance relationship. Not with each other, but with different people.\nWhile I had to struggle daily to keep the moods up, and that was because the lady and i had never spent sufficient time together, My friend dated my classmate since college, and they're due to get married this year. Or i think they're married already, I'll have to confirm.\nWhat happened in my case: I had hardly spent any time with my partner as she left for medical college in abroad. The only awkward thing that kept our desperation going, was the conversation between us. Later it didn't work out for us because my work was impacted and our families didn't support our relationship etc.\nMy friend had ample time to spend with her lady. Her families supported them and they could withstand the long distance relationship, for over 5 years (the guy is in usa and the lady is in india). This could happen because they had spent some time already and this i believe helped them to get through the distance constraint.\nI was a non believer that long distance relationship works. But after seeing my idiot friend and his fair lady, i am thinking that they did it right. I used to ask my fried whether he had any affairs during all this time. He said it never happened to him. So therefore, the qualities you have in a person matters too. Personally, i never tried to look for an affair until much later in my long distance relationship. The reason for that could be that I was more unhappy and desparate about my long-distance relationship rather than being happy about it (there was nothing to feel happy about, i had to struggle daily just to keep someone happy on a different time zone, Obviously it couldn't have lasted for long..) So, do it right and make it a point to spend time with each other (physical presence, not digital) whenever the distancing gets to you and makes you feel insecure.\nI wish you luck, friend.

Yes, it's been almost 2 months now since she mentioned about the breakup for the first time. It was a long distance relationship. I am not writing this answer to defame her. I just want make you people aware that people can change in a single day also if your actions hurt them. Sometimes even one small mistake will outweigh all the good things and the person will leave you. If you are lucky, you may get a second chance. But definitely if you get second chance, it's my request not to let down that person. Not everyone gets another chance.\nThe one who says that he/she loved you the most and won't be able to fall in love again may admit that he/she started feeling for someone else within a matter of days. So, be ready to face that also. It just shows how strong the feeling of love was. People gets attracted and start to have feelings for someone else within few days of breakup\nNow, when I look back and see that what I did to get that person back, I laugh at myself but I don't feel bad because I can't imagine if I will do such thing for anyone other than my family. I am even sure that even in future I won't be doing such an effort to get someone back in my life because I don't think I will make someone as important as I made her for me. Even Karma will show her someday that someone won't even give a fuck about reconciliation if she breakup with someone in future.\nWe don't even know the real meaning of love these days. Love is not making your partner jealous. Love is about growth of both the partners 360\u00b0. Love is about not giving up on each other. Love is about taking care of your partner when he/she is going through a rough phase. Love is about a strong foundation of trust. Love is about not looking for perfection but accepting the flaws of each other. Love is about helping each other and being a pillar of support during the low phase. Love is about giving respect to each other. Love is about recognising the efforts from your partner. Love is about appreciating the small things that your partner does for you. Love is about pushing each other to grow in their careers. Love is about having a person with whom you can talk about your deepest fears without hesitation.\nMaterialistic love fades over time. If you are in love with someone physically, the beauty will fade aways in some years. The same spark will vanish in some years. The excitement of sex will also diminish in years. What will stay is the other form of love which is shown by the efforts, respect and care.\nSuppose you love your parent or sibling or someone very close to you who was there to take care of you and stood with you when you needed the most. If you truly loved that person, will you leave him/her alone when he/she is suffering from depression, mental stress or any other problem in life? Is this the definition of love? First comes the caring, then comes love.\nWell to be honest, my problem is that I am brutally honest which backfired for me. Being a Punjabi and staying in Chennai, I was feeling very lonely here. I installed Tinder app just to find some company to go out with as a friend. Yes, that was a terrible mistake. Even now during quarantine I am staying alone but I am happy just because I have kept myself busy with a planned routine and my hobbies. So I don't think I needed someone even at that time. It was just I didn't have things to do. I was not having any work at the office. I was always nudging my partner to talk to me.\nI informed my girl about this in advance. I went out with the tinder match and told my girl about this after coming back also. My honesty backfired for me. That was the reason for her to breakup with me. I didn't cheat on her. I didn't sleep with anybody and I won't do it. Getting intimate with someone emotionally creates such a strong memory in your subconscious brain that whenever you touch someone else you feel yuck. I had always thought of being intimate with just one person during my whole life. If I had known that the person will leave me, I would have put boundaries.\nBut my mom taught me that don't change your values of being honest just because someone didn't appreciate. My father was an honest man, I have got this quality from him. The two other qualities which my mom told that I have got from my father are helping others and treating everyone equally. She has been a constant support for me. She also told me one very important thing to do and that is to do good to others without expecting anything in return. Earlier I used to expect from others after helping them. But now I am doing things for others selflessly.\nYou will be surprised to know that how immaturely that girl acted when I asked her that If I had kept this as a secret from you, would the things have been fine between us? She answered in Yes. It shows that maybe she just wasn't able to cope up with the separation and was just waiting for me to commit a mistake to leave me but she won't accept this ever because she has a huge ego.\nSomedays back she told me that I won't get someone like her. I wanted to say that I will pray to god that he doesn't give me someone like you who gave up on me so easily. I don't want someone who lose trust on me so easily. I am a human being, I am not perfect. I can make mistakes. But that doesn't mean giving up on me so easily when I put so much efforts to save the relationship just because that person matters to me.\nShe left me but I didn't think of leaving her because I was not enough for her but she was enough for me. I definitely believe that I will get someone more mature and intelligent than her who won't give up on me so easily. I hope even she will lower down her ego so that she doesn't lose people from her life.\nShe didn't realise what she is going to miss in future. I had already planned a lot of things for her which I will be doing now for someone else\nProposing her for marriage while singing a song and playing a guitar\nCooking favourite food for her when she misses her home\nTaking care of her when she is sick\nSinging songs for her while holding her hand\nDancing with her on the day of wedding\nGifting her a Pomeranian dog on her birthday\nPushing her to pursue her hobbies even after marriage\nCooking her favourite meal on weekends\nTeaching her how to ride a two-wheeler\nGiving her surprise visits.\nCelebrating her birthday in an orphanage or old-age home.\nI think god has different plans. He doesn't want her to experience all these special things which I wanted to do for her. If not her, I am going to do this for someone who will come into my life and will not give up on me and stay with me. I have always believed in the old-school ways of love and that won't change ever. If you really want to feel the meaning of love, do it old-school way.\nShe has written few answers on quora and If you will read them and match with her current actions, you will laugh the way I laughed!\nI am a man of my words and I stick to my values and principles. But for some people their values also get changed within days.\nInitially I faced stress and anxiety but now I have started pursuing my hobbies and passion seriously which I couldn't do while I was in a relationship. I have started posting my singing videos on instagram and recently started my cooking page also. I am regularly doing meditation also. I learnt how to ride a bike. I learnt how to play chess. I am doing online courses to improve my skills during lockdown. I am watching documentaries online instead of wasting my time watching useless movies and shows. I am even trying to write poetry these days. Some strangers from Instagram have inspired me to write. I am regularly reading books. I will soon start a new page for my poetry when I will have a good quality and quantity of content.\nI am waiting for the lockdown to get over because I am going to get a tattoo also which I always wanted to. I have two dates planned too. Slowly, things are going really well.\nMy advice to all of you who are currently in relationship or going to be in relationship in future, just appreciate the honesty of your partner. Nobody is perfect in this world. Accept the flaws of your partner. Don't let your ego destroy the relationship. Be honest. It takes a huge effort to build relationships, value them. You may lose a person because of your ego but maybe later regret. For god's sake, don't make the promises with your partner which you can't fulfill.\nSPREAD LOVE.\nPS: I won't disclose the details but my mom is super cool.", "My first relationship started beautifully, had ups and downs in the middle but ended as a joke. Yes, it's been almost 2 months now since she mentioned about the breakup for the first time. It was a long distance relationship. I am not writing this answer to defame her. I just want make you people aware that people can change in a single day also if your actions hurt them. Sometimes even one small mistake will outweigh all the good things and the person will leave you. If you are lucky, you may get a second chance. But definitely if you get second chance, it's my request not to let down that person. Not everyone gets another chance.\nThe one who says that he/she loved you the most and won't be able to fall in love again may admit that he/she started feeling for someone else within a matter of days. So, be ready to face that also. It just shows how strong the feeling of love was. People gets attracted and start to have feelings for someone else within few days of breakup\nNow, when I look back and see that what I did to get that person back, I laugh at myself but I don't feel bad because I can't imagine if I will do such thing for anyone other than my family. I am even sure that even in future I won't be doing such an effort to get someone back in my life because I don't think I will make someone as important as I made her for me. Even Karma will show her someday that someone won't even give a fuck about reconciliation if she breakup with someone in future.\nWe don't even know the real meaning of love these days. Love is not making your partner jealous. Love is about growth of both the partners 360\u00b0. Love is about not giving up on each other. Love is about taking care of your partner when he/she is going through a rough phase. Love is about a strong foundation of trust. Love is about not looking for perfection but accepting the flaws of each other. Love is about helping each other and being a pillar of support during the low phase. Love is about giving respect to each other. Love is about recognising the efforts from your partner. Love is about appreciating the small things that your partner does for you. Love is about pushing each other to grow in their careers. Love is about having a person with whom you can talk about your deepest fears without hesitation.\nMaterialistic love fades over time. If you are in love with someone physically, the beauty will fade aways in some years. The same spark will vanish in some years. The excitement of sex will also diminish in years. What will stay is the other form of love which is shown by the efforts, respect and care.\nSuppose you love your parent or sibling or someone very close to you who was there to take care of you and stood with you when you needed the most. If you truly loved that person, will you leave him/her alone when he/she is suffering from depression, mental stress or any other problem in life? Is this the definition of love? First comes the caring, then comes love.\nWell to be honest, my problem is that I am brutally honest which backfired for me. Being a Punjabi and staying in Chennai, I was feeling very lonely here. I installed Tinder app just to find some company to go out with as a friend. Yes, that was a terrible mistake. Even now during quarantine I am staying alone but I am happy just because I have kept myself busy with a planned routine and my hobbies. So I don't think I needed someone even at that time. It was just I didn't have things to do. I was not having any work at the office. I was always nudging my partner to talk to me.\nI informed my girl about this in advance. I went out with the tinder match and told my girl about this after coming back also. My honesty backfired for me. That was the reason for her to breakup with me. I didn't cheat on her. I didn't sleep with anybody and I won't do it. Getting intimate with someone emotionally creates such a strong memory in your subconscious brain that whenever you touch someone else you feel yuck. I had always thought of being intimate with just one person during my whole life.

You are not your anxiety. \u201c\n\u201cYou wouldn't worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do.\u201d\n\u201cI hold onto the Scripture that says, \u201cBe anxious for nothing, but in all things give thanks.\u201d I'm not saying I don't have problems or that I don't worry, but I try not to be stressed. I manage my anxiety through prayer. Worry shows up on your face, and I don't want that.\u201d\n\u201cYou are strong for getting out of bed in the morning when it feels like hell. You are brave for doing things even though they scare you and make you anxious. And you are amazing for trying and holding on no matter how hard life gets.\u201d\n\u201cAnxiety makes you worry about tomorrow, but really all you can control is right now.\u201d\n\u201cThe greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another. \u201c\n\u201cDo not believe the things you tell yourself when you are sad and alone.\u201d\n\u201cYou're not going to master the rest of your life in one day.

It is something you can re-live again and again and again, but each time you will know that it's not meant to be. You just know. Your heart just lets you know.\nIs each time equally hurtful? Yes. But the second time and the times after that, you know how it feels. So you just bounce back quicker. Ask a mother how was the second childbirth? She will tell you that it was very painful, but the first one just killed her. For the second time, she just knew what to expect. So it was easier to accept that pain.\nBreak-ups aren't supposed to be seen as trauma.

His outward characteristics for us is that he will feed and clothe us but he will not save for us. Whatever there is, it is about today. He does not show any savings and always emphasizes that he lives for today. Our expense per month is close to $5000/month which includes all living expenses and not anything luxury or vacation/holiday expense.\nHe expects me to be in a traditional role cooking and cleaning and take care of kids responsibilities. This had left no time for me to work full time to support myself or have any savings on side.\nI am a planner. At least I WAS. The role that I have to play now pis not of being myself. I am literally dancing on his fingers. I have panic attacks for not being able to plan for future and I am literally dying inside for having no savings.\nI have spent past 2 decades raising my kids and brought in minimal income because I still wanted to work and have some money to feel confident. However, my part time income could never hold up half the expenses we have.\nNow that my kids have grown up and my second child will be attending/leaving for college I want to open the cap and let the pressure out! To me it was important to give my kids a lovely, safe, secure childhood, so I remained submissive, quiet and agreed to everything that was not acceptable either.\nEnough is enough.\nI have about 15 years left of work before I can retire.

My husband does not care about anyone including our kids feelings.\nThere are not many choices that I have.\nHe is the bread winner and makes good money since past 3 years for us to live comfortably. Before that his income was low and we were suffering with tight budget. I have always been supportive with house and kids responsibilities which gave him all hours including weekends to work on his career. He worked hard but that\u2019s for himself. I have no say in the money matters. According to him as long as you are taken care of today that\u2019s all that is his responsibility. There is no life insurance even just to cover the burial cost in case any unfortunate event happens.\nThe money he makes is all his. He pays all bills and brings food. Our family never have to compromise on eating lesser quality. However what is unnerving is that I only have today. There is nothing for me for tomorrow. There is nothing for me even if I wish to throw a party for my son\u2019s graduation. I have no say and no money.\nPart II of your question: Are you too nervous to make the move?\nYes I am beyond nervous. Panic attack wake me up as soon as I fall asleep. I cannot breath. I worry about finances and my inability to make money or shift out of this house.\nIf I stay quiet, then there is nothing to worry about. However, if I want to think or plan about tomorrow then I have no place to start with.\nI have looked up all job postings and the skills I can be hired for are minimum or less than minimum wage. That would total up to $2,500/month. With that income I cannot do anything and I would have to lower my lifestyle completely to the point that all I would be doing is work day and night to save anything. There will be no \u201cwife\u201d in the house for myself \u201csomeone\u201d who will take care of the house work while I work. Medical insurance will be non existent level.\nAgeism is another block for career. How do I even compete with all younger fully talented and fresh graduates? I cannot.\nI have looked into community college for certifications to get me a job, those are 2 year courses. That cuts down to 13 years remaining in my career and the start out pay is average. My husband will not chip in a penny to help with any cost for tuition. I would have to work full time to pay that cost. He is a horrible person and allows me to drive really old car that has no status of being a middle class. It\u2019s embarrassingly poor class.\nI am lost.

It\u2019s hard to be vulnerable with people so you\u2019ve made a big stride forward in dealing with your childhood experiences by doing this.\nI believe the issue you\u2019re having is that you\u2019re communicating by text. Text messages are best for quick conversations \u201cdoes 5pm work for you?, \u201ccan I borrow your notes?\u201d Or lighthearted conversations \u201chow was your day?\u201d \u201cDid you see the new episode?\u201d Serious or complicated conversations are best over the phone or in person. These kinds of conversations need added signals like body language, inflection in your tone, and the emotional expression on your face. Over text words can be read with many different emotions and emphasis. All this to say it\u2019s entirely possible your boyfriend has no idea how serious you were being, if you were sad or angry. It\u2019s very hard to process and understand how someone is really feeling when you are simply reading their words. If it were easy to convey specific emotions and intentions through text everyone would be a successful author :)\nIts also possible it was too much information and too serious for him to process or handle and he\u2019s backed away. Hearing something very serious about your partner can be difficult, and he\u2019s trying to understand and process it alone. Maybe he thinks you over shared and he wasn\u2019t ready to hear something so intimate about you. Maybe he\u2019s confused and unsure of why you told him. Maybe he\u2019s never heard a story like yours before and has no idea how to react. There\u2019s lots of possibilities here. But to find out you need to talk to him in person (from the appropriate distance) or over the phone. Call him and explain why you told him, that you trust him, and then tell him how you\u2019d like him to react. Do you want him to just listen and comfort you? Do you want practical advice? Do you want him to open up more about his life? When you\u2019re having a conversation remember there are two people involved. It\u2019s not just you talking to a wall. This is a person with free will and choice. Understand that even though you are ready to open up, he might not be ready for that. You should give him the choice to say so. He may say \u201cthis is too much for me, I am dealing with enough.\u201d Maybe that is not what you want to hear but it\u2019s best you give him the space to be honest.\nRegardless, your boyfriend isn\u2019t meeting your expectations but you didn\u2019t make it clear what those are. call him and say \u201cit worrried me you didn\u2019t text me back, it\u2019s better to talk about this over the phone. Sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable. Here\u2019s why I told you\u2026can we talk a little more?\u201d And listen\u2026", "He might be just trying to take it all in about what you told him .

While I\u2019ve always heard \u2018opposites attract\u2019 in relationships, I\u2019ve also never experienced it first hand.\nNow I know. The integration has not been necessarily easy to configure, but our love has been the Great Balance.\nAnd it\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me in over half a century.\nThank you babe, you complete me \u2764\ufe0f", "I used to date people who are exactly like me, or who I aspire to be. Loves adventure, travels a lot, life of the party, highly intelligent.\nHowever, the \u2018lights\u2019 also show their \u2018shades\u2019, the traits on the other side of the coin: easily bored, short attention span, cocky, flighty, hot-tempered, meandering, acting before thinking.\nIck. They were too much like me, they even have my own bad traits that I really hate.\nI just dated a guy who isn\u2019t like me, but our personalities complement a lot of ways. He\u2019s mellow, rational, quiet; a bit of a homebody. But also introspective, very reliable, cool, practical, focused, and a great conversationalist.\nWe\u2019re not total opposites, in fact we have several things and interests in common. Unlike my previous relationships, he doesn\u2019t fight fire with fire, I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\nHe\u2019s the yin to my yang.\nor as he says it, I\u2019m Charlie Munger and he\u2019s Warren Buffet (except that neither of us are white male billionaires)\nAlso he loves his privacy so I\u2019ll just post an avatar version of us :)", "Both.\nThe bizarre thing about love is that someone can be your dream person, have all the traits in the book that you fantasized someone of having, yet you could feel absolutely nothing for them. At the same time, you can meet someone who carries all the traits you despise yet somehow your heart burns for them.\nThere are certain things that must be similar with me in terms of being able to have a relationship. For one, I need someone who is intuitive, insightful and able to have deep, philosophical conversations about a variety of topics. Someone who is inquisitive and isn\u2019t afraid to speak their mind who also never wants to stop learning and progressing in life. I also do not want to be with someone who already has children, or actively planning of wanting children because I do not see myself having children in my life. They also must like cats, that is an absolute must especially since I plan to have cats in my life. Being highly conservative, or being excessively involved or obsessed with politics or religion is also not what I want, and I want someone who takes care of their body and health with exercise and loves traveling.\nAside from that, I would say I am flexible and ideally I\u2019d want someone who is more extroverted than myself. I am profoundly introverted as it is, and I think the relationship would be rather dead and boring if the other person is somehow even more introverted than I am. I would most definitely not want someone who is exactly the same as me, because I want to experience life with someone who can bring more fun and excitement through their exotic worldview.", "Neither. An ideal partner catches your mistakes and holds you responsible for them, while also providing the love and care you need sometimes. This causes you to improve, and hopefully you to improve them.\nA very similar partner will often result in both of you making similar mistakes, while neither of you being conscious of them, but you will more often than not receive the care you need at times.\nA complete opposite partner, by contrast, will catch ALL of your mistakes, and you will most likely do the same with them. Since neither of you can really relate to each other, you can never really satisfy each other\u2019s emotional needs.\nIt is ideal, therefore, to find a partner that shares a good amount with you, but is quite different from you in other ways. My partner, for example, is a social butterfly, while I\u2019m more of the introvert. We are both however more thinking types of people and want to go into the medicinal field. We strike a balance. It\u2019s ideal in a relationship for partners to balance each other out.", "I like both a lot to be honest. Leaning towards one that does both.", "Q: Is the \"ideal partner\" someone who is very similar to you or the complete opposite?\nBoth.\nTypically, your ideal partner will be compatible. They will share with you a good number of entertainment likes, and not that many dislikes. This makes it pleasant to spend time with them, all entertainment loves company, it enhances the experience to share it with somebody that likes it, at about the same level as you do. That can be mutual interests in music, in physical activity, in movies, in TV Shows, in books, in art, in cooking or baking. You also want at least some mutual likes in decor, furniture, and other home furnishings, so you can both feel comfortable in common spaces. Now you might also have some separate spaces, but you don\u2019t want to have to live in a kitchen or living room you hate, and neither should your partner have to do that.\nTypically, your ideal partner will also provide synergy, meaning the two of you together can be more competent than either of you alone. They are good at something you are less good at, and vice versa. Together you make a good team.\nNow those two elements, compatibility and synergy, are also the recipe for non-romantic friendships. You like being with each other on shared interests, and you make a good team besides that. You might be ideal partners in business, for example, or ideal partners for an artistic collaboration, or a competition.\nThe final ingredient for an ideal romantic partner is mutual sexual interest. If you do not sexually attract and eventually satisfy each other, the romance will be short-lived, and you will revert to friendship, and any love will stop being romantic love and revert to platonic love of a friend. Or vanish altogether.\nIn the sexual department, you still need that compatibility, there must be some intersection between what you enjoy and your partner enjoys, so you are both satisfied. There may be synergy as well; in which case one partner is good at something sexual the other wants, and vice versa.", "This is the absolute love of my life, my wife Viktoriya.\nWe have in common our love, passion and an unbreakable connection with one another, and share our spiritual beliefs.

I think my worst relationship trait is an unwillingness to \u201cwork things out.\u201c\nThis might come across as an inability to communicate feelings. And there's some truth to that. But I think another part of it is that I just don't think talking about relationships do anything. I think it's a form of accepting people as they are.\nSo like maybe something will bother me for some weeks or even months. But I don't make relationship decisions quickly once I decide to enter into one at all. So I'm making observations and subconsciously trying to establish a pattern of behavior. And when I decide that there is a pattern, I accept it and decide to terminate the relationship.\nThis might come as a surprise to the other person because I hadn't complained about anything, though some feelers will notice something is off before it happens.\nSo it's not just that I can't express emotions. It's also that I avoid the emotional difficulty of communicating because the cost-benefit analysis doesn't work out for me \u2014 because people don't really change.\nAnother complication of this trait is that once committed in a relationship, I tolerate bad behavior for a really long time.

So that's another reason to remain stubborn, which might be very irritating in modern therapy culture.\nA more minor point is my unwillingness to REALLY feel things. I used to think it was just because I hadn't met the right person or I haven't allowed myself to be vulnerable.\nBut I think a good deal of it is that emotional highs and lows just don't feel comfortable to me.

Why or why not?\nIn my experience, successful, fulfilling relationships do take work. Some involve harder work than others. Much depends on the individuals involved.\nSo what does \u201cwork\u201d in a relationship really mean? Most people don\u2019t often consciously think about it. Two things about relationships that are true for me are: 1) Love alone is not enough. (Sorry to rain on your parade, the Captain and Tenille :)). 2) It\u2019s important not to get complacent and take your relationship for granted. While early on in your relationship, you feel so happy and fortunate to have someone special in your life, that recognition and the actions that reflect those feelings can fade over time and can have a seriously detrimental effect on the health of the relationship if left unchecked. So it's important to tell and show your partner how much they mean to you on a regular basis.\nWork in relationships involves the following:\nEffective communication. Being able to comminicate effectively with your partner can make or break your relationship. Not everyone is a good communicator, so it can take work. Listening, patience, and a sincere effort in really trying to understand your partner are key.\nBeing able to compromise. This relates to communication and commitment. Part of what makes a relationship work is a willingness to make compromises. It can be easier said than done, though. So you have to be willing to know yourself and if/how you can meet your partner half way to accommodate them. Small compromises are also a sign of goodwill and can make a difference.\nLearning how to fight fair. It's an essential skill in relationships. And it\u2019s hard. It can be really hard. I\u2019ve struggled with it myself. When we feel wronged, it can be hard to listen to the other person. What it comes down to is what\u2019s more important to you: being right or preserving the relationship?\nKeeping the passion going. While early on in relationships, passion is a given, over time, it can wane. Most healthy relationships involve a strong mental connection and emotional and physical intimacy. In this regard, demonstrations of love and affection are important. The importance of sexual compatibility in a relationship shouldn't be underestimated either.\nSo yeah, relationships involve work. How hard the work is, is different for different people.", "Good relationships don\u2019t just happen.

A relationship between 2 ppl, who are similar in some ways and complete opposites in others has to be balanced. That's where it gets hard. You have to pick your battles. You have to compromise. You have to keep the lines of communication open. You have to give each other space. You have make time for friends. You each have goals, that may not be the same. No matter how hard you try sometimes, one or the other won't be happy at some point. You then have to decide who's willing to give up what for the other. Throw in family, children, bills,and anything else life throws at you and it's quite a challenge. Don't always look at the negative. Stay focused on the positive. Hope for the best. Whatever happens, happens. One person can not make it work on their own. Resentment will eventually set in. It's a 2 person deal.

But please understand that, if you don\u2019t feel out of place asking for what you need, then he needs to be understanding. We are all human. We have our own needs and it is our job as respect to ourselves to OWN our needs. NOTHING is wrong with the things we need in relationships because we are all unique individuals. In a successful relationship you must own each other\u2019s needs as well. Note this also. Your significant other probably isn\u2019t the same personality type as you, whereas he might be more introverted and not likely one to show affection when you want it; but, if you don\u2019t say you want the affection, sex, etc, how is he supposed to know if you don\u2019t say anything or communicate it? This is what you have to do when a couple has two completely different personalities. Because the other is different, they aren\u2019t going to think the same as you, and in essence they aren\u2019t doing any harm by NOT giving what you need, if it\u2019s not communicated. I was in the SAME boat as you are. The only way to understand each other, is to tell each other what you want from the other in that moment. Or else the other is going to have no clue, leaving the other upset. Yes it\u2019s been six years for you, but relationships are a never ending communication train that you just have to go through. If you love each other enough, you will follow along with what the other wants, accepts what they have to offer, and remember that you\u2019ve been together this long for a reason, because of love. So I\u2019m saying try not to assume he doesn\u2019t want to give you what you want. Assume he just doesn\u2019t know what you want in the moment. My significant other is different than me too. He\u2019s more the introverted type. I sometimes have to remind him, I want a hug, I want to do this, that, etc and because he loves me he will do those things. And after awhile he starts recognizing when I want those things and he gave me those things eventually without me having to ask for them. Your S.O. Will do the same for you\u2026.through communication. Open and honest communication.\nAlso, try having the both of you take the Myers Briggs personality test. Then when you both get your results, look up on google what type of person that person really is based on their personality. Honestly this helped me and my relationship by a ton. He understands me now. And we\u2019ve been struggling to understand each other for years. But now we can, because of time, patience, affection and communication. And please remember that you\u2019re 100% true to your feelings, nobody is to shame you for them. Don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re asking too much from the relationship because you\u2019re a person too and when you\u2019re upset just communicate that to him. Be honest how you feel. Things will turn around. Also don\u2019t expect the same reactions you give to him, because again, your personalities are different, and because your personalities are different, the other isn\u2019t going to have the same exact reactions that you have and they aren\u2019t to blame for this. I used to do this with my S.O. and always got disappointed. Then I realized that he is who he is.

You will accept bad behaviour, you will not hold people to standards, you will have no or low expectations in partnership and the bad patterns of toxic interactions will run on repeat endlessly unless you literally stumble into a miracle of a person who loves you despite how little you're loving yourself. Rare indeed.\nNow if you ace that relationship with yourself, which is not that difficult given the right kind of help and support; things take a sharp upturn in success, happiness, joy, love, contentment, fulfillment, and collaboration in your relationships\u2026 that's where I'd focus my attentions and investment - on your relationship with you.", "Well Sarah I do believe that coming from a toxic relationship to a healthy relationship has its challenges. Typically it takes awhile to rebuild trust again and the person's confidence and self esteem are often shattered and have to be rebuilt. These individuals are oftentimes referred to as damaged goods, a term I don't particularly care for. I can personally relate as my ex wife cheated on me and was incredibly verbally abusive. The challenges can be overcome but with time, its helpful if in the healthy romantic relationship, that the partner is patient and understanding. I hope this answers your question. Have a nice Easter.", "Every relationship is challenging. A healthy one is one you're not gonna want to end", "I can see that to be true, if the person who was in the toxic relationship, brings the toxic past into the new relationship. Which is why after being in a toxic relationship, one must take the time to recover from it, learn from it, and forgive yourself from staying in it, in the first place. Then when your mind is healthy again, you can move on from the past and into the new.", "I wouldn\u2019t think it would be the most challenging at all. I believe that your mind will not completely allow you to be happy in the beginning. You may struggle to trust and accept what is good. The most challenging relationship would have been the toxic one. You want so bad to love, you want so bad to fix what\u2019s wrong. The problem is you can\u2019t control what\u2019s happening and it messes with your mind, self esteem, ability to trust. You also find yourself wanting out then second guessing yourself because you love them. You hope things will be better you think they will change. They will see that you are worth more and we\u2019ll that never happens. You put so much into a broken relationship to end up alone in the end and unable to trust or accept true love when it finds you. So the most challenging is the toxic relationship not the healthy one. A relationship is not healthy at all if it\u2019s challenging.", "I never heard that but it makes sense.

Start small, as forgiveness of a toxic person can take some time.\nDancing, Singing, Chanting and even Drumming. Dr. James Gordon recommends shaking your whole body to fast music.

This is related to loving yourself but basically means: get a good night\u2019s sleep, eat well, exercise, do some socializing with others. A good support network is also recommended. Start with one habit each day. Eat a salad or go to bed earlier.\nWater for cleansing. You can take a shower, wash your face, or go swimming in a pool.

But you can\u2019t move on till you close that door. Good luck as we all struggle with this.", "Why does it take so long to heal from a narcissist relationship than a regular relationship?\nThe reason it takes so long to heal from a Narcissist Relationship (NR) compared to a regular relationship is because a NR is unlike a regular relationship. It is an abusive relationship as opposed to a healthy one. Hence, the impact this has on the individual that is victimized by abuse is one with deep mental, emotional and psychological wounds that takes more time to heal and recover. That\u2019s the short answer.\nI\u2019m guessing the next question is \u201cHow is a NR different?\u201d\nA NR differs in several profound ways. First, if you got entangled in a relationship with a Narcissistic Person (NP), he/she did a total mind*uck on you through manipulation tactics and other strategies that Narcissists (N) use to victimize his/her person.\nIt is a bizarre, repeating cycle of psychological warfare that include tactics referred to as Love Bombing, Devaluation and Discard. This is similar to brainwashing and eventually leads to developing a trauma bond (attachment) similar to Stockholm Syndrome.\nUnderstand that a NP doesn\u2019t initially come across as a horrible monster with evil intent. If he/she did then most of us would have enough basic survival sense to instinctively stay away or run in the other direction. The NP pulls you in slowly over time with positive traits, affirmations and builds your trust (Love Bombing).\nOnce they think they have you hooked in (trust gained/guard down), that\u2019s when the next phase starts (Devaluation). It is a process of undermining your sense of identity, self-worth and value.\nThe devaluation comes via subtle or overt insults towards you, things said and done that demean or make you question your self-worth. The N knows your weaknesses, wounds and what triggers them. He/she will pick at them piece by piece until you have little to no sense of self-worth left. This increases your vulnerability to being completely controlled by them.\nLet us not forget the gaslighting that is often also used by the NP in this process. Of course, nothing is ever the NPS fault \u2013 you are to blame, you are defective. Unfortunately, even when you resist, if you stay around long enough in this psychological warfare you will begin to believe the NP in that you are nothing, defective, unworthy. That\u2019s when the discard takes place.\nAt a time when you are weakest, the NP will attempt to annihilate you by ghosting or discarding you as if you are human garbage to be kicked to the curb. Then, at some point, he/she will return and the Love Bombing phase begins again followed by the devaluing and discard. Wash, rinse, repeat . . .\nIt becomes a cycle of hell and rollercoaster ride that goes endlessly round and round until you are able to find the strength to get off. And, that is easier said than done. You find yourself miserable with them and even more miserable without them. Therein lies the complication of a trauma bond.\nA *trauma bond is not just psychological. It is biochemical and physiological. Some have described it as being very similar to an addiction. Even comparing it to trying to break free from an addiction to heroin. A part of you awakens and realizes that you need to get out of this toxic, abusive relationship, yet every time you try it becomes another living hell and rollercoaster ride within yourself. Far too often, we return to the very thing that has broken us. No you are not crazy \u2013 you are experiencing and caught up in a trauma bond.\nHaving a high IQ or EQ will not exempt you from being sucked into the Narcissistic Person\u2019s (NPS) web of destruction, chaos and victimization. Unfortunately, the smarter we are intellectually and emotionally the harder the fall when we realize we have been duped and victimized by a NP.\nThere is often a great deal of shame and embarrassment that we allowed someone to do this to us. This is yet, another dynamic unlike a regular relationship and another layer of healing we must go through and address in order to overcome a relationship with a N.\nNonetheless, understanding the traits and tactics (red flags) of a Narcissist, Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) and the varying subcategories (Covert, Malignant, etc.) is your greatest protection. It is a very helpful tool in your own healing and recovery process from ending a relationship with an NP. Going NO CONTACT with the NP is your greatest escape and hope for full recovery.\nGoing NO CONTACT means just that. You completely block all communication and do not engage with the NP at any level. Even if you co-parent there are ways to do this. The importance of no contact is because, you cannot heal and recover if you are still ingesting the poison the NP is feeding your mind, body and soul. Also understand that if you have formed a trauma bond (attachment) with the person, when you go no contact you will go through a detox and withdrawal period very akin to having to overcome an addiction.\nIn summary, when a regular relationship comes to a close there is a normal grief and healing cycle that occurs in response to a loss; an ending. When trying to end a relationship with a N it is far more complex because our sense of identity and self-worth has been completely unraveled and destroyed. Thus, it often takes much longer to heal, recover and rebuild.\nThere is hope. Though healing and recovery may not be easy, it can be done. There are many of us who have broken free from a NPR and are not just survivors, we are victors who are thriving in our new life without the NP. Knowledge is power. Empower yourself with knowledge from \u201ccredible\u201d sources about what a narcissist is, does and how they victimize others. Gain greater understanding about Narcissistic Personality Disorder.\nThen, most importantly, focus all of your energy doing what you need to do to heal, build yourself back up and start a new, emotionally healthy life. Part of that must include taking an honest, deep look into yourself and recognizing any old wounds (abandonment, childhood abuse, co-dependent, etc.) that made you more vulnerable to someone who is an abuser that added to their ability to take you down.\nIt\u2019s time to stop putting your time, love and energy into the NP and start putting it where it is deserved \u2013 on YOU. It is time to heal anything and everything that has ever broken you in this life, so that you can rise up to become the amazing, beautiful human you were destined to be. If those good traits didn\u2019t exist in you, the NP would have never chosen you as someone to break.\nNo one deserves to be abused. Read that again! It does not matter who you are or what you may have done or not done in this life - NO ONE deserves to be abused, not even you!\nYOU ARE DESERVING and WORTHY of love and respect \u2013 it starts with you loving and respecting yourself. No one else\u2019s permission or approval is required for that. Learn to recognize your high worth, value and potential \u2013 then work on becoming it. Be your own best friend and cheerleader. Love wins!\nSending out the light of love, peace, truth and greater understanding.\n-Kathy the IronButterfly\n*Below are a couple of links to resources that can offer some more in-depth details to what I have shared here today.\nFive Signs You Are In A Trauma Bond (article)\n5 Signs You\u2019re In A Dangerous Trauma Bond With A Toxic Person\nTrauma Bonds \u2013 What is it?

(video)", "In regular relationships there isnt trauma bonding, stonewalling and gaslighting. All that stuff really messes with someones head and the realization that that person you believed to be true was all a lie. It takes time to get unfcked from it all. But it is possible and I know you can do it. :)", "Has taken me 4 years and therapy.", "Trauma bond. The narc has brainwashed you to the following: Only I can save you from the pit of despair, no one else will do. Your identity is chained to me. Your worth is chained to me.\nWhat takes time to realize is: the narc is the one who put you into despair. The narc is demon and savior in one, that\u2019s why you are so drawn to them. It\u2019s perfect conditioning.\nWhen a regular relationship ends, there\u2019s love and investment. But their is no constructed dependency, one partner hasn\u2019t continuously broken boundaries and vaporized the other partners worth. There was no love-bombing. No isolation. No silent treatment. No discards. You get closure, which you won\u2019t get from a narc. You\u2019ve been respected, which you\u2019ve never been by the narc. You always had some control, in the relationship- you never had that with the narc.\nYou don\u2019t feel absolutely powerless and out of control. Your heart is broken, but your mind hasn\u2019t been reprogrammed. That\u2019s why.", "All relationships with narcissists tend to leave a whole bunch of unanswered questions and unresolved feelings - and with little prospect of sorting anything out.\nTypical narcissists end a relationship with a massive discard and devalue as well, which can be very traumatic. One of the hard things about the D&D is that it\u2019s undeserved. What\u2019s actually happening in the discard is that the N is not only ending the relationship but they are also making it ALL your fault. The N HAS to do this so that they can keep their opinion of themselves as \u2018good\u2019, \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018perfect\u2019. You HAVE to be the bad person and the one at fault.\nAlso, because the N will have \u2018faked\u2019 the relationship - even to themselves - there\u2019s a lot of confusion as to what is actually happening. The N will have been acting a part all the way through and then, typically, will suddenly change, often for no reason that the partner can fathom. Usually this is because the N has cast themselves and the partner in roles (almost exactly like in a film - and nothing to do with your real qualities either) and then things haven\u2019t worked as the N wanted. For instance, perhaps the N styles themselves as someone who \u2018rescues\u2019 others. They \u2018rescue\u2019 you. But, as soon as you start to get better, - at the point where a \u2018normal\u2019 person would be delighted at your recovery - the N becomes enraged. Why? Because you stepped out of your \u2018role\u2019.\nGive yourself a breather. And accept that there will be unanswered and unresolved things. You have been dealing with someone who is profoundly emotionally disabled.

This love exists in higher dimensions. Soul understands it and it is unforced and natural.\nHowever we may love others in the same way through intention.

The emotion is the result of this connection rising out of the heart first and entering the mind. This love is unconditional and exists without expectation. This bond of love is strong. It is divine and is the essence of the Source of all.\nHowever ego can distort this love and use it for its own edification turning it into lust or obsession. One has to be aware of its subtle twists and devious working. Awareness is therefore required.\nLove for the sake of love is called limerance. It is a state of mind. It is usually an addiction to the brain chemicals produced that maintain the euphoric state of mind.

I don't know. But by comparison to what comes from God, it is not. Nor does it appear like the same thing, at all.

Ideally, real love should have rhe components of passion, intimacy and commitment.", "Generally speaking, females use sex to gain Love. Males feign LOVE to gain sex.\nWith that in mind, true LOVE is not a feeling or emotion. Feelings and emotions are fleeting and can change in a nano-second!\nAh, but you did hit upon one word that makes sense in your question\u2026A CHOICE!!!!!!!!\nYou can choose to Love, as you can choose to hate. BINGO!", "Most of us tend to focus on falling in love and use the feeling of love to determine the duration of a relationship. Falling in love is easy to do, almost effortless, but losing that loving feeling is not that hard to do, either.\nOf course, when a relationship is new, it is fun and enjoyable courting or being courted. In the beginning, we are constantly thinking about the new person in our life, and wanting to spend all of our time together and share new experiences together. We want to show how we feel by getting cards or flowers or just sending a cute text message.\nFeelings, however, can be fleeting. No one seems to want to talk about how those loving feelings can fade, that it takes work to keep the love alive, and that choosing to stay in love is a choice we all must make.Who we love is as much of a choice as it is a feeling. Staying in love takes a commitment. After the rosy glow of the new relationship wears off, we have to make a decision: Do we want to love this person and commit to a relationship together, or are we going to let this person go? Once we have made the decision that we have found the person we want to be with and commit to, then the work begins.\nA big part of that work is making many other choices. It is a choice to see the good in our partner every day, rather than focusing on the negative things that bother us. We have to accept them and love them as they are. If we go into a relationship thinking we can change someone, we are setting our relationship and ourselves up to fail. We all have flaws and quirks and are weird in some ways. Accepting those differences is part of love. We can choose to ignore the petty, irritating small things our partner may do. If our partner forgets to take out the garbage, or leaves the cap off the toothpaste, we can talk about it with them, but we also can accept that this just might be forgetful, and choose to move on.\nTrying to change our partner into us is one of the biggest relationship mistakes we can make. When we are unhappy with how things are in our relationship, it is easy to overfocus on what we are not getting from the relationship. Instead, a healthier response is to see what we could be doing for our partner, rather than focusing on what they are not doing for us. We should always try to be supportive of our partner, because we cannot expect anything from our partner that we are not willing to give ourselves.\nAnother important choice we can make is to choose to remember the reasons why we committed to this person. Our relationship will not always be pleasant and there will be times for serious discussions and disagreement. There will be trying times and even bad times that we will need to work through together. The key to surviving these times is to remember to be respectful, acknowledge our commitment, and work through whatever is at hand together. During these times it really helps to remind ourselves of why we chose to love them in the first place.\nLove is all about choices. We choose to see the good, ignore the petty, look for what we could do for our partner, and remember why we love our partner. Choosing to put in the effort to do these things is what love looks like, and with that work comes the wonderful reward of staying in love.", "First feeling and then emotion, the last part is choice."], "topic_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 16, 2020", "question_author": "Christopher Suldo", "view_list": [15, 8, 16, 113, 8, 4, 5, 40, 4, 1, 20, 13, 2, 200, 9, 6, 186, 356, 76, 5, 108, 144, 8, 101, 2, 99, 282, 10], "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 31, 0], "name_list": ["David Shaw (\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3 \u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05d5)", "Shelley Scofield - Christman", "Frederick Leiserson", "Lalanga Premathilaka", "error", "Phil Carrillo", "Sarang Mastoi", "Mary Rose Ocmer", "Bette Sexworth", "Vanessa Santana", "Christina Moore Inspire", "Barb Randal", "Steven Parada", "Tony Escorcio", "Theresa Nova", "Sriharsh Sai", "Nazmul Islam Rabbi", "Des Viera", "Nagarajan Ramachandran", "Rhon Cotton", "Nilanjan Shee", "Jonathan Quentin", "Haseena Sheikh", "John Cowart", "Dove White", "Denny McLeod", "Aharon Dobin", "Devon Wellington"]}, "587": {"no_of_view": "1,135", "date_list": ["Apr 2, 2020", "Mar 30, 2020", "Mar 30, 2020", "Mar 28, 2020"], "question_title": "How does a teenager know they are in an abusive relationship?", "no_of_follower": 3, "respond_collected": 4, "ans_list": ["This website gives you the best tips and more:\nDating Abuse Statistics | Loveisrespect.org\nHere is something else I would recommend to you:\nKnow yourself.

Otherwise, you\u2019ll feel bitter and resentful towards others.\nCompromise is the name of the game when it comes to relationships whether personal or business.", ". They expect you to attend to their needs\nDo they make you do all the chores around the house? Are you expected to make dinner and put the kids to bed without help? If they make excuses as to why they can\u2019t help (aka. they are tired because they worked all day) that is emotional abuse. A household should be made up of two equal parties which means the chores and the household duties should be fairly divided.\n. They interrupt you when you\u2019re talking\nIf you are trying to talk about how you feel or your day at work, they should wait until you\u2019re finished before they talk. If they are constantly trying to get their word in and not letting you speak, it means they are trying to control the conversation.\n. The speak louder and more aggressively\nThis is another way for them to try an control the conversation. Couples make life changing decisions during conversations. If the abuser is able to dominate conversations and get their say all the time, they have effectively dominated life. The abused partner never wins any arguments or gets their thoughts heard.\n. You always need to ask permission but they never do\nThey might make you ask permission before you invite friends over but then you get home from work and their friends are in the living room watching TV. You also need to ask before you go out but they never do. If you see them doing things that you know you wouldn\u2019t be able to do without them approving, this is very emotionally abusive.\nThey tell you you\u2019re the abusive one\nIf they say you\u2019re being mean or you\u2019re acting in an abusive way, they are just projecting themselves onto you. Abusers want to feel like the victim because they don\u2019t take ownership for their actions.\n. Guilt Tripping\nThey make you feel bad so that they can get their way. This is a classic sign of emotional abuse. If you want to go out with your friends but they insist you stay at home, they should be okay with it if you decide to leave. Guilt tripping is a form of manipulation because they want to make you act in a certain way without flat out telling you what to do.\n. They try to make you jealous\nImagine they wanted you to go to a work party with them but you stayed home because you were sick. Then they go on to text you and show you pictures of how much fun they\u2019re having so that you feel jealous/guilty for not going with them.

K - Rakuten Kobo\nScribd Practical Spirituality in Puzzled Life\nBe Happy\nXoxo", "They don\u2019t leave because they might be more unhappy.\nI believe that happiness is a choice we must each make in many aspects of life, and love is one of those choices.\nWe can choose to be happy and grateful for the love that we have built with another soul, or we can choose to be unhappy and believe that we deserve better.\nThose who choose to be unhappy have already ended their relationship, or at least are mentally on the exit ramp of the relationship.\nThey lack commitment to the relationship or they lack commitment to their own happiness that would push them to leave. Often they believe it is the relationship that serves them happiness rather than they who build happiness and love with a lover that they have chosen.\nSome people motivate themselves with unhappiness of their current state, they force unhappiness on themselves to motivate themselves to move forward in life and in love.\nSome people motivate themselves with pride and gratitude for what they have and what they have accomplished, and allow that pride and gratitude to motivate them to work harder to build more love.\nI believe that those who choose unhappiness in life are more challenging to love. They just never glow, there\u2019s always a sense of failure, dark clouds or impending doom, what they have is never enough. Their lovers sense that feeling and are less motivated to work at building love as the sense of never being enough holds them back.\nIt would be expecting too much to expect that people who complain constantly or are perpetually unhappy would just leave. For them life is a balance that will always be on the negative side. They may call themselves unhappy, but the won\u2019t risk leaving because they might be even more unhappy alone.\nI believe in self-love. If you love yourself you will attract and be drawn towards other people who love themselves. Those of us who choose to be happy enough with ourselves to love ourselves are better able to love and be loved.\nLove is always a choice made by two lovers, one day at a time, hopefully for a lifetime.\nI believe that it is a horrible flaw to share your unhappiness outside of a relationship, it breaks the trust and communication that is essential to love. If you\u2019re unhappy in a relationship, only one other person needs to or should know, only one other person can help to fix this, only one other person can help fix this.\nWe have been married once and still for 15,155 days (41+ years). Many days were unhappy as life challenged us, but we never gave up on the choice we made to love each other.\nSee also: Peter Ratcliffe's answer to What are the first signs that make you understand that you are falling out of love with your partner?", "Sometimes we stay because of children and finance,or maybe we try to hold on to the sweetest memories of there love and want it to give everything that is in them to stay and pray it works or maybe they are scared to be alone", "Because they are selfish people who dont give a shit about any one but themselves.", "Because sometimes even though you\u2019re suffering in the relationship you still love the other person and hope that things will eventually change. You focus only on the good parts when considering to break up with the other person.", "People are very flawed. They choose to ignore what\u2019s logical and continue to drive themselves crazy trying to \u201cwin\u201d. They fail to realize relationships take a two party effort to succeed. They\u2019re willing to carry the load and be miserable. It\u2019s called giving up and allowing someone else the chance at taking their place. They\u2019re willing to place their health at risk stressing over a relationship that they know should\u2019ve long ended.", "I think some people stay because of stability, maybe only their partner is working. Others stay because of their children's sake. And some people are just have the fear of the unknown, not knowing how to even proceed with how to leave or would rather just put up with being unhappy.\nI couldn't honestly answer your question as there are too many variables in why someone would stay.\nSometimes it takes a breaking point or push to being so fed up, that the point becomes clearer to just end or leave at that point.\nBut your right, having a good enough grace to end a cycle of unhappiness you would think is just common sense.\nBut here's another thought, if you were once attracted and happy once upon a time in your relationship, wouldn't you want to try and fix it as well? Through counseling or couples counseling or perhaps years go by that the both of you have fallen into a rut, routine, fallen out of love that you just don't care.\nIt takes two and sometimes if you really think about it, all one party has to do is gave the courage to fix it or leave it. You yourself have control of that right in your head.", "That's damn good question. I dunno. But instead wanna go involving someone else who ain't anything to do with their quarrel just so they can finalize the breakup. Never understood that.", "I believe this boils down to circumstances. There are so many different reason and none of which are good reasons.\nfear of being alone\nchildren\nfinances\nobligation\nguilt\nThose are the main reasons one of the big ones are financially I believe. People who live together worry about the money involved in being independent. They worry about child support alimony for marriage. If those didn\u2019t exists I think more people would leave. Less people would cheat or have affairs because it doesn\u2019t cost them money for years and years for a choice they made.\nGuilt is also a big one, they may feel bad that they don\u2019t want the relationship and really don\u2019t want to hurt the other person. Yes, staying is prolonging the hurt but people don\u2019t really think that way.", "Because people get comfortable, fear change, worry about what people may think or don't want to be the bad guy.", "There's a variety of reasons but I will say fear. Fear of being alone. Fear of having to start over. Fear of changing their routine. Fear of change. Fear of disappointing families, and friends. Fear of hurting or upsetting their partner. Fear of admitting that it's over to oneself even.\nPeople sometimes will put up with bad situations because they simply are too afraid of what they'll face on the other side.\nPull that band aid off and things will be alright.", "Because relationships are never just as simple as a bunch of feelings of happiness or unhappiness. There's way more all layered up in there.", "How many times were you unhappy with yourself in the past. Does that mean you must commit suicide? No. Because, this is the only life you have got and, therefore, you must make do with whatever you can, isn\u2019t it?\nIn like manner, people who seem to be unhappy in their relationships may either feel that the unhappiness could be short lived or feel unsure of how the ending of it and starting another might turn out to be and, therefore, fail to end it.\nBesides, being accustomed to the discomforting situation over time, they may get used to it and stay put just like this anecdote about the frog: When you place it in a bowl of water and slowly raise the temperature, it does not jump out to save itself but being used to the slowly rising increase in heat, it stays put and dies!", "I know right?! I think is because they are afraid to be lonely and probably think nobody else is going to be with them\u2026. So that brings them down and they don\u2019t want to feel miserable and alone.but also because they have low self stem and they think they deserve \u201cthat\u201d.", "Sometimes those people are sacrificing for others. Which to me is ridiculous. You have one life and it shouldn\u2019t be spent pleasing others. Sometimes it\u2019s pity. They\u2019ve dated the person for so long that they don\u2019t want to leave them high and dry.", "Maybe they are scared to move on.", "Fear is the largest reason. It can be very scary to start over even if they aren\u2019t getting their needs met at home. Unfortunately too many people think their partner should be a mind reader and don\u2019t openly convey that their needs aren\u2019t being met. sometimes they do communicate this and their partner simply doesn\u2019t listen. From here they are left with a choice start over or stay where they are.\nYes they should just bow out with dignity but far to often fear makes them do things like cheat or try to open relationships when they have never been polygamous. They test the waters to see if there is a better solution out there and cause their partner all kinds of hurt. If they stay it\u2019s because there isn\u2019t if they leave it\u2019s because they found someone else to meet those needs. Either way they destroyed a person who most of the time they admit was a great person but just wasn\u2019t meeting a small thing they wanted. It\u2019s disgusting and even worse people actually applaud them for it many times now without even realizing the utter destruction this does to the spouse they left behind.", "Some of us felt trapped in our relationships. If you become financially dependent on your partner and they are always putting you down, ensuring you don\u2019t have friends, discouraging you, eventually you will start to see the issues but don\u2019t feel like you have anywhere to turn.", "Fear of society, their codependency whether its emotional or financial also fear of loosing their reputation and insecurity for their future makes someone stay in a toxic relationship. Its just not easy to get out of a relation if it involves more than two people. And thus people try to hide their actual feelings and continue with their existing and not so good relationship. And in between they do all sort of things that soothes them to be in that contract which is just not mutual. They dont have enough courage to get on with their lives themselves.", "Ask them? But in all seriousness, you shouldn\u2019t snoop around in other people\u2019s business.", "I wonder the same thing people talk how their unhappy all the time but they choose to stay", "Your question denies the complexity of human relationships entirely.\nWhen people have history, when they have invested love, time, energy and hard work, focus, and devotion, into a relationship and it begins to fail, they react in a sensible manner, or a not-so-sensible manner.\nEven when you have a beloved article or family heirloom and it beaks often, you might mend it continuously and seek every possible way to fix it, until you no longer can. So why wouldn\u2019t you move heaven and earth to stay together?\nGrace has nothing to do with it.", "It is easy to say it but not easily done because behind every close door there is an uncover reason why it cannot be fully opened.\nthere is a reason for people\u2019s behavior and you can never understand it until it happens to you personally. The reason can be related to financial issue, protecting the children or a loved one, protecting the relationship to prove ennemis wrong, accepting it to satisfy your parents because it\u2019s a cultural thing to do, or many more. It is important to talk to support those people and try to understand the reason behind their reaction to the problem so that you can help them in any way that you can.", "I know this from experience but a lot of the time it\u2019s just because they\u2019re simply too scared to let go of each other.

So no.", "If writing it will make you feel validated and better- then yes. Write it down for your own peace of mind, but there is no need to send it.\nChasing after someone who doesn\u2019t want the relationship will only be detrimental to your self esteem and sense of integrity.\nVirtue comes in many forms, but it is not appreciated by all. And that\u2019s okay. We are not entitled to anyone or everyone seeing the benefits we have to offer. It is not our job to promote our excellence.\nThe right people will see your qualities and be grateful for them. A compatible person will appreciate what you have to offer, and you wont need to remind them what they have. They will know, and they will be attracted to you precisely because of it.\nPeople who are secure with themselves do not advertise or speak about their strengths. They are confident that they have certain qualities, and those qualities speak for themselves.\nSit back with the assurance you have about who you are and what you bring to relationships- and find peace knowing that the right people will read that energy and recognize it. Honest people don\u2019t need to go around telling others how honest and integral they are. Loyal people don\u2019t need to brag about their intense loyalty. Intelligent people don\u2019t need to tell others about their education and credentials. These qualities are embodied and come across through interaction and actions.\nFinally, in relationships- we desire and value different things. If we are looking for a specific set of traits, other positive traits will be less salient if those traits are not something we value. For example, if you value assertiveness and intelligence in a partner, you\u2019re not going to see or care about the modesty and cooperation demonstrated by a potential partner, if those aren\u2019t qualities you value.\nIt is quite possible that the things you offer in a relationship- and the qualities you have- aren\u2019t things that your ex desires or values in a partner. It is plausible that he feels no loss. And that is not an insult, it is the simple fact that we all value different things. It is okay for someone to want \u201cbutterflies\u201d or excitement. Some people have a high need for intensity and novelty, and that\u2019s okay. If they prioritize that over other things, power to them. No one is wrong when it comes to their subjective preferences.\nNo one needs to be shamed for their preferences. When I was younger, I would date boys who weren\u2019t looking for love, care, or commitment. So they didn\u2019t value or recognize the traits that make me a good long term partner, because they didn\u2019t care about those traits. That\u2019s entirely fair. Not everyone needs to love and appreciate us, because we\u2019re not going to be compatible with everyone. That\u2019s okay.\nOwn who you are. Remain authentic. Know your strengths and don\u2019t allow someone\u2019s indifference towards your qualities and strengths make you insecure about who you are. You don\u2019t need to convince anyone of your greatness. Own it, and trust that in doing so- compatible connections will emerge.", "This really has to be YOUR decision at the end of the day. I'm encouraged that you had a \u2018happy\u2019 \u2018content\u2019 relationship for 18 months! So refreshing to hear this in todays flaky dating/romantic relationships world.\nBut your post is strange! Your boyfriend broke it off due to lack of \u2018butterflies\u2019 in his stomach! My dear, nobody has butterflies after 18 months! And your post is contradictory. Happy and content FOLLOW the \u2018butterflies\u2019 period! Very strange that he should say that.\nI'm leaning towards a different explanation here. Perhaps your relationship had become STAGNANT. This often happens with relationships that have been of a duration of over 12 months. The initial excitement/euphoria is followed by happy and content. And then what?\n2 things usually happen. The relationship grows really strong and secure in nature. The couple ARE usually thinking about possible long term relationship as in life partners or indeed marriage. See where I'm going here?\nMy guess is that your boyfriend did NOT see you both becoming life partners. The \u2018stagnancy' had set in. You'd become each others \u2018comfortable pair of slippers' BEFORE making definite long term plans. Things had become mundane and predictable.\nThis is what your ex was referring to as lack of butterflies! No excitement. Probably your physical relationship had become boring? This is perfectly normal given the time you 2 had spent together.\nOr perhaps (more likely), he has met someone else who provides the butterflies. Who excites him. This is him \u2018sowing his wild oats' young lady! This is probably what's happened.\nWhich leads me to answer your question directly. What you two \u2018both' had may NOT be in accord. You mean what YOU felt you both had! What YOU felt you have both lost. No good telling your ex boyfriend what he HAD and has been (seemingly) LOST!\nHe KNOWS what he had and has lost. He's probably happy enough with the breakup. Happy enough as in ACCEPTED that you 2 were simply not meant to be in a romantic relationship of considerable (if not lifelong) longevity.\nLet's look at the facts: Your boyfriend ENDED the relationship because of lack of so called butterflies. I DOUBT this very much. It is almost certain that your boyfriend ended this romantic relationship because he's simply decided that you 2 are NOT meant to be. Or he's met someone new and he's getting the \u2018butterflies\u2019 again!\nIt is a massive decision for a man to end a romantic relationship. Especially after 18 months. When a man ends a romantic relationship he immediately loses so much. A good companion firstly. Regular (and very important) SEX.\nAs I said at the beginning of this answer, it is really your decision as to whether to write to him or not. But I most definitely would NOT. I believe your ex boyfriend does not LOVE you. He may well have done. But right now, almost certainly not.\nIf your man is not doing all he can to maintain the romantic relationship, then he's basically telling you I've called time on this relationship as I do not love you. The lack of butterflies given to you as a reason for relationship dissolution is utter BULLSHIT.\nHave self respect always. You're the QUEEN remember. You were dumped. That is more than enough to cope with. But writing a letter to the dumper will get you nowhere. He's moving on. And so should you. Tough advice I know but for the very best.\nDoesn't matter one iota about how much you think he's lost. What matters is that he dumped you. When this happens to the female, she NEVER chases the male. Keep self respect intact. You will find that special someone where you go on to form a lasting relationship. Butterflies (or lack of), is utter nonsense. Take your rejection and move on please. Do NOT write that letter if you want to maintain self respect. If he ain't \u2018jumping through hoops\u2019 to be with you, then he ain't worth it!", "Give him space. I mean, this things hurt a lot and you keep on wondering what you did wrong. There is nothing wrong with you. Even though is hard to understand, people change. There is nothing exactly to explain why this happen. Each person Is different, feel different and see things differently. You don\u2019t own him to try to make him reason or see that he is missing something very valuable. No. Just let go. Sometimes, time is the right answer to make you see why things like this happened. Try to move on. Don\u2019t seek, don\u2019t beg. Let go.", "You had a happy, content relationship, but for him it lacked \u201cbutterflies\u201d (chemistry). Thats what\u2019s needed to ignite the flame of passion. If you want him to see you as someone desperate, then write him that letter. It will probably be the final nail in your coffin. Desperate is not pretty. After 18months, he knows what he wants. It\u2019s not as if he just met you and didn\u2019t really know you, he knows you through and through, he knows what he\u2019s thrown away, but that\u2019s what he wants, you don\u2019t have to explain anything. Try to accept it and move forward. When it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over.", "You are hurting and you want to fix it. The problem is you cannot fix this so the only other choice you have is to accept it. You should be thankful that he was honest with you. That showed he cared enough not to keep you in a relationship where you were not loved as you should be loved. Dating is about finding the right person and that takes time. Once that time has passed one either knows that person is a fit or knows that person is not. No matter how you feel you are not a fit for him. Now, you need to let it go. Yes, you will feel sad for that is normal but you cannot linger in the pain or you will stay stuck. Start doing things. Have fun. Join a gym. Be glad you are free now to find the man who will respect you, love you, and want to be with you.", "Breaking up is painful, there\u2019s no way around it. When a man says he doesn\u2019t have \u201cbutterflies\u201d tingling his heart strings anymore, he is looking for that new relationship thrill. When the chase is on, it\u2019s a real titilating experience for them. If a man is mature and looking for a long term relationship with a woman, a heightened sense of having a romantic desire will last with that special person long after the butterflies build their cocoon. Men love to do the chasing until they\u2019re caught! If he stopped the pursuit of you, he\u2019s move on without you. Write your letter and lock it away so you can get your feelings under control.", "In my opinion if it\u2019s worth saving he will come running if not then it\u2019s not unfortunately.", "N ,leave him.alone,if y chase him he will avoid you", "Why would you want to write to him? What can you tell him at this point? Maybe you're hoping to change his mind? Have some dignity and move on. He doesn't love you the way you love him and he told you so. Good luck.", "Please don\u2019t do this. It will get you no where, if he cared he wouldn\u2019t have broke it off in the first place. Leave it alone and move on.", "No. He doesn't care and has moved on.\nYes. If it makes you feel better and then, you stop bothering your feelings and mind for just one person.\nFind someone worthwhile even if it takes a longer time. Enjoy life.\nTake care of yourself and self-worth.", "No, he has made a choice and it only involves you as the injured party. You\u2019ll never convince him that he lost a great thing, or that he made a big mistake. First of all he has convinced himself that his choice is the right one, and no amount of revelation by you will help that. I suggest you move on and build a better life with someone who will appreciate you. And if your paths should cross in the future, your happiness with your new love, may show in actions what words couldn\u2019t convey. Make yourself move on, time will prove your worthiness to someone who doesn\u2019t need butterflies every day. You have a choice, you can run your mind..or let it run you! Love isn\u2019t logical, just like arranged marriages aren\u2019t about love, they are about duty. If he no longer loves you, you\u2019ll never convince him that your the best and the relationship is a duty to experience it. best of luck DL", "Nope you making yourself sound like your better then him and its his loss well your making yourself hipped and sounding needy you need to move on let things die down move on its over good luck", "You can do that, but what for?", "No. That\u2019s a really bad idea. Move on. No more thinking about your ex. No more complaining about your ex. No more contact with your ex. You have a life. Don\u2019t waste it on a jerk. Go build a great life. Do that and the angry feelings will evaporate as memories of this jerk fade to unhappy little memories, like the time you had a really bad cold, but then you got all better\u2014easy to ignore.

I think in times like this, especially if either one of your main love languages is Touch, then it is key to try to top up your 2nd love language in whatever way you can. People feel loved in different ways, and not hitting the right one feels just like buying a washing machine for your wife on v-day (okay, not the best of example cause some would really love that, but you get the idea).\nKnow that love is a choice, not a feeling. - You\u2019d be surprise but yes, love is not a feeling. Ask any married couple who have been together for years and they will tell you that there are many times when they felt irritated by their partners, etc, but it\u2019s the choice to love regardless. Feelings do make it easier, but the key essence is still a choice. There is this joke I\u2019ve heard, \u201cA boyfriend is someone who irritates you 90% of the time, but also loves you 10% of the time in a way that makes you forget that 90%.\u201d\nLove is also spelt T-I-M-E. - Take time to invest in each other\u2019s lives, whether be it to FaceTime each other, or just have a morning / goodnight call here and there. If you both have decided to choose each other, then make the effort to be there for each other (even if it has to be over video rather than in person). Just like a child who will eventually grow closer to the parent who invested more time in their life, the same applies to our partners.\nConsistency over intensity. - We have always favoured intensity over consistency. Just like how we wait till the end of the season to binge watch a TV show over the weekend; or we do crash diets and hope that it will be successful. However, what really works and lasts is consistency, never intensity. Working out 14 hours at one go is never going to work as well as 30 mins a day over a month. Going to the dentist once every 6 months is never going to be as effective as that 3 mins of brushing your teeth twice daily. The same goes with your relationship. It wasn\u2019t because you pursued your partner over the weekend (or the other way round if you are on the receiving end) constantly that got you both together. It\u2019s all the little things that you both did for or together (e.g. you saw a movie and wanted to watch it together; he/she wanted to get some groceries and got something for you; etc) that made both of you realise one day that, \u201cHey, I love this person.\u201d\nI know that it all seems like a lot of things to remember or even do, and this might be a monkey wrench into what I shared but\u2026 know that there is no formulae to relationships.

Sometimes arguments happen because the person wants to be heard. Additionally, listening is more important to have healthy and constructive discussion.", "Depends on what you're arguing about and how you go about arguing. Differing ideas about the same topic can be healthy and educational if done respectfully. Practicing being respectful and learning to listen to your partner without becoming defensive can build useful skills for dealing with others besides your partner. There's alot of positive things that can come from constructive debate. But, if it's over a bunch of little shit that is just a battle of will power it can be destructive and a huge waste of time and energy. Just like everything there needs to be balance for growth and happiness.", "When we get angry we stop being nice and we start being honest. If you argue productively as in saying what you wouldn\u2019t normally say as opposed to saying things to hurt the other person then you can actually build a stronger bond. Saying things like you never get me off isn\u2019t being productive. It may be true but it\u2019s not productive. Saying you never do the things I like in bed is being productive. In both cases your partner may be hurt but hurt must be risked sometimes to deepen a bond and increase satisfaction for both people in the relationship.\nToo many times we bite our tongues out of fear of hurting the person we love. This builds over time until you now resent this person and eventually when you do say what\u2019s on your mind you say it in a way to hurt this person who in your mind has betrayed you. Had you came out and said what you thought sooner there would have been no betrayal for either of you. There will be hurt but you must risk that sometimes. Just make sure you are risking hurt when you attempt to better yourself and your relationship. Be constructive not critical. If you raise a topic you better damn sure be ready to suggest solutions or at least be willing to accept there reasons for what they are doing. Personally I don\u2019t reveal a issue until I\u2019ve had a chance to think it over and looked at possible solutions to the problem.\nA common argument had these days between couples involves where to go to dinner. The man suggests 50 places and the woman turns every damn one of them down. She has no clue where she wants to go but she knows she doesn\u2019t want to go to anywhere you just suggested. The man gets frustrated, the woman gets frustrated they argue and do it all over the next week. The problem is the woman won\u2019t tell the man she wants him to value her opinion but also be assertive. Instead of waiting until the day you are going out the man should plan the evening at least a day in advance. He should know what she enjoys or if in a new relationship ask her what she enjoys then make reservations to a restaurant he knows they will both like or try out some place they may like. It will end the pointless argument they are having and they will both be happier. Of course if the woman would be more productive and just say hey dumb butt step up your game when they are arguing it would end faster but too many people don\u2019t argue productively these days.", "It's always good to discuss the problem at the moment. Most of the break ups are happening when people are holding things for too long. Just because you said nothing, doesn't mean your emotion is also gone. To swallow the bad emotion is like to swallow a drop of a poison , it will destroy you slowly untill it kills you completely . So quick arguments are good in the relationships", "A newly gained perspective. A more abundant appreciation for their difference of opinion.

He had a 3 year old daughter that lived in a separate state with her mother. Mind you when I met him he was in AIT in the Army and his actually family was scattered throughout two different states so as far as meeting anyone close to him that could call him out on his lie I didn\u2019t have a chance. For a while things were amazing. He said that he had an amicable relationship with his child\u2019s mother (They were never married\u2026 Important for the later part of this story) Him and I were friends on each others social media and I never saw her comment or post on any of his stuff and when we were together his phone wasn\u2019t ever blowing up to make me believe any different from what he was saying. Well fast forward to the end of his training when he finally moved to the base he would be stationed at\u2026. He ended up getting stationed at Ft. Sill which was about 22 hours away from VA. We decided to keep the relationship going and worked out how we would get to visit each other and all that jazz. He left VA at the end of November/ beginning of December. He was at his home base for a short period of time before he let me know that he was going to be deployed to Korea soon and he wanted to see me before he deployed. I drove 22 hours straight to Oklahoma and saw him the week before and of Christmas. I left Oklahoma on the 22nd because I wanted to spend Christmas with my family and he said that he was going to be spending it with his daughter. Well during the time we were dating I can only guess that his childs mother figured out who I was or wanted to be nosy so I noticed that she had popped up under the \u201cPeople you may know\u201d on Facebook right at the top. I didn\u2019t think much of it because I just assumed he had finally told her that we were dating since he \u201cclaimed\u201d his family knew who I was as well. Well Christmas day I was on Facebook and doing my usual scrolling and ended up getting a friend request which prompted me to look at the \u201cPeople you may know\u201d since it is on the same screen and I saw that her last name had changed to his last name! I freaked out and I contacted him and went off! He said that she just had false hope and she was crazy and I shouldn\u2019t go off of what I see on Facebook. I calmed down after a few days and we stayed together. Mind you there were other small hints in between this happening that I ignored but now looking back I see that I shouldn\u2019t have\u2026 Then a week or so later I start getting notifications from my Pinterest and of course I look to see that she was pinning things from my Pinterest to hers\u2026 I chalked it up to being her being petty until I realized she had stuff posted showing that SHE MOVED IN WITH HIM! To make a long story short\u2026 They were together the entire time and I was nothing more than a side piece. I ended up contacting her and telling her everything and she decided to stay with him because of what he could offer her and because he was in the Army (her words, not mine) and because of the benefits she wanted another child with him. Come to find out he was also seeing another girl that I had no clue about as well\u2026. Them being together didn\u2019t last long before he ended up kicking her out when he got back from Korea and sending her back to live with her mom, they stayed married and ended up splitting the benefits so he could live on his own and cheat in peace and she still didn\u2019t have to work and now that he is out of the Army they are no longer together or have any dealings with each other and he ended up cheating on her with over 10 women, many of them were during the period they lived together (which was a very short period of time) and were in the home and bed they shared together."], "topic_list": ["Relationships", "Dating and Relationships"], "create_time": "Mar 28, 2020", "question_author": "Anonymous", "view_list": [108], "upvote_list": [2], "name_list": ["Marie Storm"]}, "607": {"no_of_view": "618", "date_list": ["Apr 8, 2020", "Apr 6, 2020", "Apr 5, 2020", "Apr 5, 2020", "Apr 5, 2020"], "question_title": "Why is it so hard to balance relationships with my creative pursuits?", "no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 5, "ans_list": ["Thanks for the question; according to me the answer is as under:\nIf you are employed somewhere so definitely it is difficult but if you are self-employed / entrepreneur then it is easy BUT it is really an art to follow your aims & ambitions when you are an employee because one side you are committed with your job and on the other side you are committed to you, yourself\u2026\nImportant\nYou can find further Unique & Useful Ideas, Innovations, Inventions and a lot more on Global Peace, Progress & Prosperity etc. by searching the keyword \u2018Global Progress Volunteer\u2019 on the Google.

You become irreplaceable once you\u2019ve shown what you 2 are together. And to do that, Trust & Respect is what I believe are the key factors for it.\nTrust is not just a mere word. It has a deep and an important meaning to everything you do in a relationship. Any relation can\u2019t work efficiently if it lacks trust. Relationships are about exposing yourself to risks that other people can impose on.\nFor example: When you get into a Uber, you trust your cab driver to get you to the destination and to only cheat you a little bit.\nYou trust the worker behind the Glass-window on Subway, not to spit in your sandwich..\nTrust is fundamental to our existence. We are social creatures and trust solidifies the bond between each of us. If you don\u2019t enrich your relationship with trust, then how can you be successful?\nRespect, it\u2019s a combination of appreciation, admiration and recognition of a person, being worth something for the other. As someone else said \u201cIf you don\u2019t have it, it will be like driving a car up the hill slope with a giant magnet forcing you back to your commencement.\u201d\nIt\u2019s about seeing someones pro\u2019s and con\u2019s, flaws and strengths, and still feeling appreciation of their unique talents, gifts and insights.\nIt is not about expecting perfection not is it beating someone into submission. Just respect your partner for who he/she is.\nWhen you take a moment to think about treating your partner with respect, remember the issues and challenges you\u2019ll be able to solve together if you both accept each other. Remember on how happy a relationship would be if you can be yourself, showing your unique, bad and good sides.\nOn the end note; Wanting to fulfill your partner and becoming irreplaceable is something we all strive for, wether you believe it or not, but being irreplaceable is nothing without a strong relationship. Trust & Respect is the glue that can grow lasting, connected and deeply intimate relationships. Never take it for granted.\nWish you all luck!", "Treat him like a king, as best as you can.

The first month was great. Great sex, lots of attention, and I felt great! Then I found out she was making other guys feel the same.\nIn another instance, I was single and pursued another woman I felt was quite attractive. Well she was very attractive, but didn\u2019t have a great personality. We often clashed. We barely began dating before I got sick of her.\nWhile in another relationship, a woman who I deemed to be a bit less attractive than my current partner caught my attention. We met as friends, joked about hooking up and having wild sex adventures. Let\u2019s call her Linda. After having a meaningless argument with my then girlfriend, I left and ran to Linda. We had wild sex, but it wasn\u2019t long before we realized that our sexual desires were incompatible. Or rather to be clear, I didn\u2019t want phallic objects inserted into my anal cavity.\nLast but not least, while single yet again and on a dating sight, I connected with a VERY VERY attractive woman. She was an actual model. I didn\u2019t think it would go anyway, but shot my shot anyway and it worked! The problem there was she was frequently traveling, so I wouldn\u2019t see her very often. She also traveled with her male best friend who was also a model \u2014 really cool guy. I later found out that she did not cook what so ever, so anything she ate was cooked for her or she ordered. She was also the type to run away from conflict, so when we had a disagreement, she\u2019s change the subject and run away. But the straw that broke the camels back was when I was hanging out with her male best friend one day. In the midst of hanging out, he bent over to get something and his boxers caught my attention. Jokingly I said \u201cThose boxers must be popular, Gina wears that same brand from time to time.\u201d He laughed and said \u201cshe needs to stop stealing them from me.\u201d. Ummm what?!\nLong story short, she\u2019d frequently wear her male best friend\u2019s boxers and shirts, especially to sleep in. When she told me she had feelings for him but he would never act, I took my leave.\nMoral of these stories, the grass is not always greener on the other side. You\u2019ve put in the time and effort to get to know your current partner. You know many of their likes and dislikes, you know mostly how they think and how they\u2019d react, and you\u2019ve worked to build a foundation. Why trash all that to try your luck with someone you know nothing about except that they\u2019re attractive?\nHear me out.

I don\u2019t know your situation so I can not make any specific recommendations- I can only offer general advice.\nBut isolating you from friends/family is incredibly toxic behaviour. It is generally a precursor to other controlling behaviours. Frankly, no one had a right to tell you with whom you should associate. We have connections with people for complex reasons, and provided you are not being put in danger while around these people, this is an unreasonable request. Cutting you off from your social network is a major red flag.\nOther signs of this would be criticizing people who are close to you. Telling you that they have poor judgment. Shaming you for associating with these people. Telling you that you \u201cchange\u201d when/after being around them. This is generally a tactic used by narcissistic personality types, or individuals who are insecure and have a high need for certainty- and do this by trying to control their environments.\nIf your partner cuts you off from your social network, or makes you feel ashamed for associating with them- then you are deprived of support and perspective. If he/she is telling you not to be around others- this is a major red flag.\nIf you submit to this request, you have just told your partner that he/she matters more than your relationships. How? If the person your partner wants you to cut off contact with is close to you- you showed them that you are willing to sacrifice a close relationship for them. Alternatively, this can be a foot in the door technique. Where they begin by limiting contact with someone who is not that significant, then this allows them to build from there.\nIn both cases- this spells danger.\nThe only situation I can envision this being tolerable in the short term- is if your partner is asking you to not contact an ex, or someone who you were dating before the relationship was official, or someone who is clearly interested in pursuing you romantically and who doesn\u2019t respect the relationship. That said, requests to not associate with some people are attempts at control. These requests show they do not trust you to act in their best interest, and maintain boundaries of the relationship. I say this can be tolerated in the short term- because if you continue to associate with a perceived threat- and the relationship continues to grow and remain strong- this may comfort your partner and reduce their fears.\nWhile this may be sustainable for a brief period of time until the partner (re)gains trust and stability, it is ultimately a sign of distrust for you, or worse, an attempt at controlling you.\nIf I was in your position, I would hold firm in your right to maintain ties. I\u2019d tell your partner that you act in their best interest, but your relationships are valuable to you, are not a threat to your relationship, and are necessary for your wellbeing. He/she does not have the right to cut you off from your social network. Unless you\u2019re in danger or associating with a romantic alternative, I would encourage you to be unwavering in your right to maintain friendships.", "Find a new significant other.\nI know myself, I trust myself. I do not hang out with undesirable people, I have good taste in friends.\nI do not need anyone to tell me who to be near.\nI am an adult, I am a good judge of character, and have self defence skills.\nI do not need a babysitter for a partner, I do not need a mother or father giving me rules, I would walk away because I want an equal for a partner, not a boss.", "Depends on the reasons. Maybe he/she knows or senses the other people and knows they cannot be trusted with a barge pole. Maybe you SO know that you're a flirt and sees the flashes in your eyes as you drool over these certain people. Maybe your SO is an insecure, manipulative overly jealous and domineering person. Only you know the reasons why, or you better find out.\nSo if you're the problem, this is the time to either realise and modify your behaviour. If the problem is your SO you have to consider dumping this person because of their nature. You see eventually you will break up anyway, if this keeps on going.\nOh, also if this person comes from certain parts of the world, or is of a certain religion, then that's just normal for them, but it's not compatible with western values. So live with it or walk away.", "Wow that\u2019s a tough question. Actually what\u2019s tough is what do you do. Unfortunately I can speak from experience and what\u2019s worse is that \u201ccertain people\u201d, was my family. Obviously she didn\u2019t come right out and say it , and although not with out difficulty, my attention or focus was in our relationship needless to say. But it was obvious to me and eventually I understood why. And the reason why, was because she was afraid that they would tell me that she was not the person you want or think she is. They didn\u2019t actually say anything either but there was definitely a degree of animosity. And being young and in love and na\u00efve and ignorant, put me in a difficult position. Not to put words or thoughts in your mouth or your head and maybe not a good example, but like most couples in love, you stand beside your significant other. And although not without a lot more difficulty, time, and effort, I started to understand her fear. And it was a number of years before I realized that I waisted the second half of a 20 year marriage. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, you stand by your man or woman but consider the reasons, who it involves and especially your thoughts and feelings.

Or is it some random person you gave your number to on the street.\nYes you have guessed it!! This is all the bulshit I have had to deal with my girlfriend.\nI most certainly would vouch for the SO regarding concerns about meeting other people. If you have prior relationship (romantic/sexual) and you have no reason for seeing that person other than sheer fun I suggest you listen to your SO. Don't go talking about insecurities and some stupid excuses to go way over board and hurt the ones you love. If you care enough about your SO and prioritize their feelings over others, I see no reason why not to respect their whishes. But if the issue is different I believe discussing openly about why they wanted that would clear things up. I made a list of people I don't want my girlfriend to see to make a clearer picture.\nEx-boyfriend who is still in pursuit\nex-husband -a twisted psychopath (but they have a child together so I can't do anything about it)\nToxic friends who really hurt her\nRandom guy who took her number\npeople who have had ill wishes for me\nOld friends with sexual history who still lingers for unknown reasons\nI am not an insecure person , but I demand respect, the same respect I give her when I block and reject girls who try to pursue me. I do get texts and phone calls from old girlfriends but I never returned them since the first time I learned it made her uncomfortable.

Maybe there\u2019s a good reason or some kind of special circumstance.\nMy spouse and I had a disagreement on some of the people we each wanted to invite as guests to our wedding. So we discussed it and learned *why* we didn\u2019t want them there. And we each saw the other person\u2019s perspective. Whether we agreed with it or not, we saw where the other person was coming from and what the reason for it was, and how that decision would impact, not just the wedding itself but our entire relationship. Because this was a very special and important event *for both of us* and it wasn\u2019t just about who the other person was hanging out with on their own time, both of our opinions on who should be there mattered. So we talked about it and reached decisions on how to handle the issue.\nI have had many partners in the past not want me around certain people, such as exes, or male friends, or even current other partners, even though I only get into non-monogamous relationships. When I talk to these partners about why, I inevitably discover that they have some kind of massive insecurity that they are trying to manage by controlling my behaviour and who I spend time with, rather than working on their own insecurity.\nIn these situations, my being around those other people are non-negotiable. Controlling who your partner spends time with is literally a line item on abusive checklists. If they can\u2019t manage their insecurities without controlling me, then we better learn that early and breakup before the relationship progresses too far.\nI do not make a good victim for an abuser. I am stubborn, argumentative, and way too convinced of my own agency. Trying to control me usually does not end will for that person. My parents couldn\u2019t control who I hung out with as a dependent teenager, you think some dude can control who I hang out with now as a middle-aged adult with my own income and my own place to live?\nSo, I find out why. The vast majority of cases, such as those that prompt questions like this, are about insecurity and control. Who I hang out with is not a debate and it\u2019s not up for a vote.

They are the lands over which I am the sole dictator with a clear bias in favor of my own benefit.\nIf you are lucky, and a good and decent person, I may take your counsel on policies affecting the lands of Mybodia, Myemotionso, and Mytimeden, but there is no higher authority in the lands than me, as Grand Empress Of The Region Of Myagencia, Joreth, first of her name.\nHe can suck it up and deal, or I will leave.", "I will ask \u2018why\u2019 and discuss openly her/his reservations and then only decide.", "IF these people can be harmful to you, I can undersatnd.

We have to make a ton of decisions every single day of our lives. Even trivial things like deciding what to eat, what to wear, when to do the laundry, etc., can consume a significant amount of mental and emotional resources, and can degrade our ability to make quality decision where it matters the most. There\u2019s something called decision fatigue \u2014 the quality of decisions you make is inversely proportional to the number of decisions you have to make throughout the day. The more choices you make, the harder each one becomes for your brain \u2014 NYT ( nyti.ms/qsQDlV ).\nHave you ever heard of guys like Steve Jobs and Mark Zukerberg who wear the exactly same looking shirt everyday despite being billionaires?\nThat\u2019s because they want to save and focus their decision making resources to where it matters the most \u2014 their work.\n(Read some great answers here: Why does Mark Zuckerberg always wear the same shirt? )\nSo, by taking great care of the household, you\u2019ll be helping your husband save a lot of decision making firepower which he can then focus onto his work and be more productive through the day. This extra productivity will add up with time and will result in increased flow of finances to your household. Doesn\u2019t that mean you\u2019ll be indirectly contributing to your household finances?\nYou can also look at this issue (or non-issue) from the point of view of working as a team in order to build a better future together. Let\u2019s say there are two carpenters A and B who are both capable of making chairs and tables, however A is exceptionally good at making chairs only, and B is great at making tables but not so good at making chairs.\nA can make 6 awesome chairs in a day, but will take 2 days to build one OK looking table.\nB can make 3 tables in a day, but will take a whole day to produce just one chair.\nNow, if you get an order of 6 chairs and 3 tables to fulfill, how will you best use A and B? Of course, by letting them do what they are good at, and finish the whole job in one day flat. But what if you rope in both of them to build EQUAL number of chairs and tables each? Hmm\u2026 sounds like a bad decision, doesn\u2019t it?\nYou should apply this to your household as well. If you go out and work for an hour and bring in 100 dollars, while your husband goes out and brings 150 dollars an hour, then it\u2019s more sensible to give your one hour to him so that he can work for two instead of one and bring in 300 dollars. How can you give your hour to him? Simply by taking care of the household and reducing his decision making load.", "My advice would be to just relax.

I really had pulled myself out of a rough patch and I was proud. However; I didn\u2019t realise how LONELY I was until my ENTJ came along.\nmy ENTJ, as cheesy as it\u2019s going to sound showed me what love is. I\u2019d never had anybody stay with me before, I had been conditioned by a very toxic INFJ to expect the absolute worst from people, leaving me with abandonment fears and tremendously horrific anxiety. It\u2019s enough to make most people run.\nNot my ENTJ, she was patient and kind. She saw past the ENFP fuzzy warmth and ditzy smile and saw depth. She stood by me and held my hand when I broke down in tears apologising for how messy I was. She listened to my stories, how I saw things and was fascinated by it, she showed up each time I thought \u2018\u2018there\u2019s no way\u2019. She understood the reasons as to why I did things and she taught me about love selflessly, she pointed out when I was getting down on myself, she pulled me out of self destructive loops. Not in a way I was dependent on her; but in a way where she taught me I could do it; just by myself. I didn\u2019t NEED to depend on her, but I could lean on her when times got tough.

They know the effect it would have on you, so stop making excuses. If someone hurts you again and again don\u2019t search for the good stuff in them, move on. Find people who love you.

As humans our desires exceed our needs. I have desires and I have a will. My desires are always at war with my will. Because sexual desire is an appetite as much as our desire for food, we end up desiring things we can't or shouldn't have. Just as enough when it comes to food doesn't necessarily stop us from desiring more food, the same can be said if sexual desire.\nThe trick is understanding that being enough is being what is needed. Making sure that that is what is provided. Then it is up to the other person to have the will to be satisfied with what is enough and not seek to fulfill those excessive desires.\nI have chosen to stay with my wife and love her because, most of the time she has chosen to be enough. I've also had to be patient when she misses the fact that no one person can ever truly satiate a voracious appetite. It can only be controlled, not satisfied. Satisfying it will only lead to trouble.\nIn the case of food it leads to obesity and all the associated risks involved with it.\nIn the case of sexual desire it l re ads to broken relationships and has a great potential of STD's, some that can kill.\nYour boyfriend needs to realize you are showing him a lot of love because you chose to limit yourself to him.

This is a falsehood fed to us practically from birth. It is demonstrably untrue, yet the unwavering belief in it causes all kinds of insecurity, distrust, and trauma.\nHe doesn't have to buy into this lie. He can KNOW that he is fully, thoroughly loved, with or without exclusivity.\nOf course, you can't do this alone. A relationship is a partnership. So talk together about all the ways you both know you are truly in love with each other. There are so many things that make your relationship special and your connection unique. Talk about those, focus on those, and nourish those. If exclusivity is the only (or main) way you know you are truly in love, then that isn't a very strong bond to begin with.\nIf he can rethink what \"truly in love\" means to you and him, you'll have a better shot at success. Maybe try explaining that he is enough for you in the ways that he is. But there are needs of yours that he can not fulfill. Like a boyfriend who is bi so the girl not having a penis means there are needs of his that would be impossible for her to fulfill. Also maybe try finding a different way to phrase it. I can not speak for him but I know there are some words or phrases that if said no matter the context can come across harsh.

This is because both of you guys are individuals. You like different things depending on your experiences in life. You show love based on how you were raised and your experiences as well.\nThis doesn't mean that you can't be in a loving committed relationship but it means that you have to find the fundamental foundation of your particular relationship. The easiest way to do this is to figure out your love language. There are five love languages.\nWords of affirmation\nGifts\nActs of service\nQuality time\nPhysical touch\nOftentimes, the way we feel love is the way we try to look for love and other people. This can cause perfect couples to breakup because they were unable to understand the love they received. For example my boyfriend values quality time and gifts. Me on the other hand, I need words of affirmation and quality time together. Another important factor in this though, is the definition of those love languages. Quality time for me is sitting around talking to my boyfriend. Quality time for my boyfriend means being in each other's presence whether he likes to play video games or be on his phone while I do something on my own. At first it was hard to tell if he loved me or not, but when understanding how he views love and how I view love, it made things easier. With that we are able to compromise. So when he is on his video games a little bit too long, he knows that he needs to spend a little extra time giving all of his attention to me. He has to remember to tell me that he loves me often and I have to remember that it's important to be with him when he wants to play video games or show him with a handmade card or maybe a gift like his favorite candy. The only way to know this however, is to talk about it.\nLastly, you can compromise but a relationship isn't fully built on compromising. It is built on each other's happiness and support. If you always compromise, neither one of you guys will be fully happy. Rather, it's important to take turns being happy sometimes. If he like to play video games for an entire day like most boys, let him and chill with him. And then when the next time comes, you guys go hiking or doing something that you like instead. But just be supportive of each other and your guys' interests. Like I said before, you must be able to communicate with you partner and find out for yourself what works in a relationship."], "topic_list": [], "create_time": "Mar 26, 2020", "question_author": "Anonymous", "view_list": [28, 4, 50], "upvote_list": [0, 0, 2], "name_list": ["Karen Davis", "Jennifer Veronesi", "Deja Simon"]}, "177": {"no_of_view": "842", "date_list": ["Apr 14, 2020"], "question_title": "Why was your relationship on-again, off-again?

Yet we are together and happy.\nMarriages don\u2019t just happen, they are build by two lovers who choose to build a lifetime of love together, one day at a time.\nNot all marriages are built to last.\n\u201cBack in the day\u201d people endured miserable marriages because they had fewer options to leave each other.\n\u201cBack in the day\u201d there were far greater social and religious stigma associated with divorce.\n\u201cBack in the day\u201d the typical single male income family wasn\u2019t conducive to security of the wife and kids, so divorce had higher risks and more endured.\nWe must stop looking at divorce as some sort of dismal failure that shows weakness or lack of morals. Love is most often a mistake, most people have multiple failed relationships before they choose to marry. We should look at those who failed and parted as courageous for leaving unhappiness and seeking better, not as failures.\nLove an marriage is a choice.\nHappiness is a choice.\nMentality has changed with more media and more social connections.\nThe modern world markets for profit with unhappiness as a tool. Someone always has better or more if you take social media seriously.\nPeople buy and sell houses more often than \u201cback in the day\u201d.

If we lack long term vision we never build a solid foundation for our love.\nMost of all, we have developed a concept that we find love, that love is something magical that appears one day and fixes our world for us.\nThe truth is that lifetime lovers build love, one day at a time, for a lifetime.\nOur secret to a lasting marriage: Peter Ratcliffe's answer to What are the first signs that make you understand that you are falling out of love with your partner?", "There have always been many bad marriages, many okay marriages, and only a few marriages that stayed really good over multiple decades.\nOne difference is that today two people who are in a bad marriage can end it and get a divorce. This used to be considered very bad.\nIt is likely that romantic movies have given people an unrealistic notion of what marriage should be. This has probably contributed to a high number of bad marriages, or at least bad relationships.\nOne counter to this is that the ability to have sex before marriage has reduced the pressure to rush into a marriage. This has probably allowed many bad relationships to end before they turn into a bad marriage.\nPutting this all together I do not think that there are any more bad marriages today than there has always been. I think there are just more people who are willing to end a bad marriage by getting a divorce.", "Marriages don\u2019t last as long as they used to because we are finally starting to see some progress on getting people out of abusive relationships. Marriages used to last longer because people had no choice - they were stuck with their spouse no matter what. Now people can leave bad relationships.\nThis is unequivocally a good thing.\nWe have also changed the role of marriages. They used to be business decisions - people joined together for property reasons and alliances[1] . Even having children had property reasons - we started handing our property down through inheritance, so we started controlling the context under which children were born.\nYour spouse was merely your business partner in that one of you provided children and the other provided resources for your survival. Or you both cooperated on providing survival resources (farm families, for instance, had both spouses working equally as hard on the farm, along with the kids and the grandparents and any other extended relatives and hired hands they could get to help). You didn\u2019t have to like your spouse all that much, you just hoped to get along with them.\nBut these days, relationships are so much more than that[2] . People get married for love. They get married for companionship. Your spouse is supposed to be your Everything now - your best friend, your lover, your confidante, your spiritual advisor, your co-parent, your business partner, your therapist, your activity partner - everything! Very few relationships can meet such high expectations for very long.\nSo relationships don\u2019t last \u201cforever\u201d because we expect too much of them. The higher your expectations for a relationship, the less of a chance it has to continue and that chance decreases over time.\nWhich brings us back to divorce being a good thing, because you can leave a relationship that isn\u2019t making you happy.\nAnd the final reason why marriages don\u2019t last as long now as they used to is that people who ask that question tend to be very ethnocentric. They\u2019re seeing \u201cmarriage\u201d through the lens of what it means today, in this time, and in this culture. it was much easier to get married \u201cuntil death do we part\u201d back when your spouse was probably going to die in their 50s. And not every culture has the same requirements for marriages. Some cultures don\u2019t recognize anything that we would call \u201cmarriage\u201d at all. Some have them for the duration of child-rearing. Some have built-in time limits. Some allowed divorce \u201cif the man is repulsive\u201d or if the woman is \u201cobnoxious\u201d.\nOn top of that, divorce rates have actually dropped. Whenever no-fault divorces become legal in a region, the rates jump up as people who were previously trapped all rush to get out, but after all of them finally make it out, the divorce rates drops back down to \u201cnormal\u201d.[3]\nIn other words, this is sort of a cross-cultural form of confirmation bias - you\u2019re seeing things that confirm your biases and not seeing the things that don\u2019t confirm your bias because you are only familiar with your own culture.\nBut the biggest reason is that we just made it easier for people to end relationships that aren\u2019t working for them. This is a good thing.\nFootnotes\n[1] Stephanie Coontz: Do you take this man?

When my father was young his father worked for the same employer for over 40 years, made a decent living so his mother never had to work. Fast forward to today, its a two person income in order to survive and this puts a great stress and strain on the relationship. Another thing is people are less religious now than they were then. Religion puts great importance on the unity of marriage.

I\u2019ve been married for just 9 months, pretty happily.\nSome days ago my husband tried to film us during sex (though he didn\u2019t manage), and that freaked me out because I had told him some time ago that I didn\u2019t want it. When I confronted him he said that he wouldn\u2019t upload it anywhere and thought I\u2019d enjoy it. Well, alright.\nAfter that I felt suspicious and decided to check his computer for some recording or something like that. I was browsing his stuff and found out that he has a secret mail account on unpopular mail hosting and he had used it to create a fake reddit and instagram accounts. He\u2019d thought up a fake name and everything. In these accounts he follows the same sex models, accidentally comments and such. He also had some porn sites accounts.\nI never cared too much about him watching porn sometimes, but I imagined that as \u201cfeel horny, open a site, do your stuff, close, forget\u201d. What bothers me, is that he did it in this creepy way, so well-thought with the accounts and the mail. He browsed these girls and chose whom to follow or not. I even had asked him before if he watched porn and he said that almost never. He always said it wasn\u2019t his thing. And now I see this. I don\u2019t know how often he did this, now all his answers are contradictory, though he doesn\u2019t deny doing it. Some accounts were created after we had already been married and lived together. That makes me wonder, if the times he didn\u2019t want to have sex were because he\u2019d already masturbated or that he preferred watching those girls instead of me? I never thought our sex life was bad (he never complained), maybe we do it a bit less often with times, but everything could be discussed, you know\u2026 I want to say again, I don\u2019t mind him/me watching something unless you have opportunity to do it with a spouse, but it\u2019s his creepy dirty way he did it that freaks me out. Now I wonder how many other accounts he has, what does he do\u2026I think he\u2019s a liar.\nSo my questions are for men and girls:\nGirls, would it hurt you too? Am i overreacting? How do I deal with it?\nMen, it that something common among men? Maybe almost everybody does that? Is that appropriate? Should I take it personally?\nThank you so much!", "I consider myself to be a reasonably open minded woman, and not a prude, but a few minutes ago someone commented to an answer you received for this question, by mentioning that on top of secret accounts and secret fake profiles which she discovered her husband having, she also disclosed that he tried to film them while having sex, without asking for her pre-consent.\nShe deleted her original comment, (it did include her full name, so I understand that), so I\u2019m putting my response and advice to her, as an answer to you too, (as it\u2019s too important to be buried in the comments), in the hope that it will assist other women. And here it is:\nThe bit which concerned me the most in your story, is the fact that he tried to film you while having sex (without your advanced knowledge and agreed permission). Then, the fact that he \u201cpromised not to upload it\u201d.\nYou should know: ALL the revenge sex tapes and photos online were uploaded by ex-partners who originally promised never to show them to anyone else, let alone share them with the world, in such a disastrously non-retrievable, un-rectifyable, irreversible way.\nI can\u2019t understand why after so much public evidence to the contrary, girls and women still trust such promises made by the temporary men/boyfriends, even husbands in their lives.\nI would insist on him deleting what he filmed, in my presence, right there and then, and at the time of asking: (will NOT accept: \u201cI\u2019ll do it later, don\u2019t worry, trust me, I promise I\u2019ll delete it\u201d, because that will give him the time to make a copy of it, which will be undoubtedly kept by him for future purposes.\nAnd he already proved to have his sneaky ways to create secret accounts, and secret fake profiles, and keep them from you).\nI would even go further, and check that there aren\u2019t any secret hidden cameras in your bedroom, and that his phone is not \u2018accidentally\u2019 facing your bed, and is \u2018unintentionally\u2019 on \u2018record mode\u2019 before you\u2019re having sex.\nThis self preservation approach may \u2018kill the mood\u2019 a bit, but I imagine that the loss of trust, the discovery of the ongoing and well planned deceit, and the high likelihood of having your life ruined in the future by having your sex life viewed by millions of strangers (and non-strangers) - is even a bigger of a \u2018mood killer\u2019.\nYou said that you are happily married. I sincerely hope that this is the only \u2018hiccup\u2019 in your relationship. But whether it is or isn\u2019t, my advice to you is: live your relationship as it\u2019s a great one which will last forever, BUT never stop protecting yourself as if it\u2019s going to end badly tomorrow.", "Is this affecting your relationship? If yes then you need to ask him you need to make him jealous. If not you try to seduce him always\u2026if not you also create some accounts to counter it. Just ask him if he lied or you caught red handed them talk to him about open relationship. Try one or the other way u will get succeed. If it not affecting your relationship then tell him you also want to watch with him and tell him to do as in porn.. makes sense. Men will be men once it comes to their head, they will never cheat. Try, best of luck. Please dont forget to share your experience.", "This is a hard one.\nAll I can tell you is that your situation is common \u2014 women tend to dislike porn while many men like it very much, and figure what she doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt her. Then, when the woman finds out, she feels betrayed, as we all do when someone keeps something secret from us.\nThe problem here is that there is a natural tension between the desire to cheat and the desire not to have one\u2019s partner cheat. But men and women have different instincts when it comes to porn. Women consider it cheating or feel that they\u2019re inadequate, while men consider it harmless and naturally keep it private, since having others view it causes shame, and have no objection to their wives watching it. (This may be due to the fact that our society keeps sexual activity private.) Men tend to think that women\u2019s concerns here are misguided and silly, and will often take the path of least resistance, in that \u201cwhat she doesn\u2019t know can\u2019t hurt her.\u201d\nI think the best thing to do is to sit down and discuss it. Tell him that you feel betrayed by his secrecy \u2014 and you have every right to be. Explain how you feel about it. And let him explain how he feels about it.\nIt\u2019s best to get these things out in the open so that the two parties can reach an honest compromise, which could be everything from him not watching porn to you\u2019re saying it\u2019s OK."], "topic_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 10, 2020", "question_author": "Mary Johnson", "view_list": [8, 13, 69, 20, 46], "upvote_list": [0, 0, 4, 0, 1], "name_list": ["Mohit Khullar", "Mary Johnson", "Dalia Bar-Dror", "Joysten Michel", "Josh Hill"]}, "733": {"no_of_view": "474", "date_list": ["Apr 2, 2020", "Apr 1, 2020", "Mar 28, 2020"], "question_title": "How can you find belonging, genuine, and authentic relationships?", "no_of_follower": 3, "respond_collected": 3, "ans_list": ["i personally believe you attract at what you want to be or what you are\ud83d\udc93\nlove yourself first then spread that love to people and forsure the right people will come\u2728", "Stop looking, if it\u2019s for you you\u2019ll get it", "The first step toward such relationship is to be genuine and authentic yourself.\nIt involves saying only what you mean.

In which case she is most likely harmless except to herself. If you are ok with it, then just move on. They are just clothes after all and sometimes begging gets annoying. Her intentions seem harmless at first with that \u201csouvenir\u201d line but it does strike odd that she refuses to give them back after you asked. What did your relationship like when together? Was it very codependent like I assumed with lack of healthy boundaries? If so, she may think it us ok or even \u201ccute\u201d she is doing this and reminding you how much she misses/needs you. The other way to think of it is that she trying to control you by watching you beg for them so you keep contacting her. Either way, I can imagine how frustrating it is for you who is just trying to move on with their life and get your stuff back. I faced this problem before with someone who wouldn\u2019t give my stuff back and kept thousands of dollars of cash and solid gold I saved with them. They didn\u2019t say anything cutesy about it though like how they still needed a part of me or something. They actually flat out lied about the cash and gold (saying I had taken it with me already) knowing I could barely prove it. They also kept saying that they would return my stuff sometime whenever they\u2019re free. They were also very rude to me during the process and said many things about me to other people that was not true. This person genuinely wanted to hurt me and kept my things as a means of control and to be a thief. Eventually I cut my losses and gave up asking. I got tired of it and moved on. I was surprised when they suddenly returned my belongings one random day but still kept the more valuable things like cash and gold. I just didn\u2019t say anything anymore because I felt like I was in a living hell before and accepted that I would get back more that what they had stolen from me. So going back to your ex, it sounds like she is keeping your things but behaving differently. She may actually just miss you and have issues letting go. Recall if she has done other vindictive things before or during your breakup. If not, then just move on perhaps or if you really need your clothes explain to her how important they are and that you can let her keep maybe one or two things. Sort of like a compromise. It is a bit of an odd arrangement I know but some people deal with grief in odd ways. She may eventually get over it and just return it by herself after recovering from it.

That\u2019s because we don\u2019t know the dynamic of your relationship, for how long this relationship exists and we also don\u2019t know your past.\nSo, the best we can honestly do, right now, is suggest some questions and ideas that may help you get to a solution.\nRight from the top, it\u2019s important to ask if your partner has been or has shown signs of unfaithfulness, lies or mistrust. That would naturally put you on alert.\nThen, we can ask a little further. Do you feel you\u2019re not enough? Do you feel your partner is better with someone else? Is your partner more valuable than you, in your eyes?\nTo all these questions, we\u2019d have to ask why and hear your reasoning. The goal here is to find the root of your beliefs and emotions attached to it, so that we can start to change and build to a new path.\nBut, we can go a little deeper and ask about your childhood experiences and how do you (or did) relate to your parents or caretakers. Have you felt abandoned before? Could you trust your parents? What happened? How did it make you feel?\nNo need to answer here. I\u2019m just teasing your mind so that you get to the source of this problem. Again, we don\u2019t have much detail into your situation so our action is limited here but, usually, these kind of insecurities are rooted in previous harming events of the past that need proper attention and care.", "Based on my personal experience, the simple reason for such behaviour is insecurity.\nNow, to elaborate; each human has a different mental ability to deal with certain kinds of things. For eg, in your case, your biggest fear in life is that you may lose your partner whereas career may be of secondary importance to you. Someone on the other hand is ready to end his life if he does not get a \u201cdecent\u201d job but may not worry much about leaving his girlfriend. So everyone has different priorities in life and we all are afraid of losing that most important thing. It's very normal. The problem occurs when that fright does not let you sleep even when you have that thing with you (your partner in your case).\nSo, I feel that you are very insecure right now of losing your partner and that is the reason you always imagine the worst. It may also happen that your partner is your source of happiness and the day you guys have a fight you may feel like everything is lost.\nThe solution to this is: you need to start loving yourself as much as you love your partner. You need to make yourself understand that you as a person are whole and no one else should be the only reason for your happiness. Of course you'll continue loving him/her as you did earlier, care for him and also go out of the way to please him/her. That is very normal. The exception is that you now know that except for your partner, there are other things in life that also matter and need your attention. Try something new with your life, like join a hobby class, hit the gym or something that allows you to focus on yourself.\nLastly, I'll suggest to speak your heart out to him/her so that he/she also knows how do you feel about the relationship.\nOh, and yes. Meditate. Early in the morning.\nThe above answer has been written keeping in mind that even I was in a similar situation at some point of time. Perhaps I still am but I am fighting my way out.\nGood luck.", "Thanks Kyle for A2A.\nIt could be a temporary development. I hope these dreams and palpitations have started only recently.\nBe so good and nice that faith on self is developed; the feeling may be like having a magnetic effect for the partner. Prayers, in addition, also can help to ward off disturbing dreams.\nIt is advisable to get checked for heart for your satisfaction. Normally they will see the ECG and will take further action after that.\nThanks for reading the above.", "This seems like a strange position to be in. Is this a new development?

Anyway we then went out for dinner w his parents, finally got to his place around midnight. I had to go back to my place so I could be closer to work the next day. So I packed my bags (I had a bunch this weekend) at least 3 duffle bags and like I said it was late\u2026 my car was parked in the guest parking lot of the apartment complex he resides in.\nit\u2019s about at least a 5 min walk and the neighborhood is not safe outside the luxury apartment complex (outsiders can randomly walk into the parking lot)\nanyway so I cleaned up the kitchen (because I also cooked earlier in the day) and put everything away and waited for him because I guess I assumed he\u2019d offer to walk me to my car? 1. Being it was midnight , 2. Being the neighborhood and 3. So many bags\nwell he didn\u2019t , he changed n sat on the couch relaxing w his phone \u2026. So I said \u201cwith a tone\u201d (as he claims) \u201caren\u2019t you going to walk me to my car?\u201d\nhe replies \u201cwhy do u have to be such a bitch about it? U can kindly say hi babe can u walk me to my car?\u201d\n(now I really wasn\u2019t a \u201cbitch\u201d I said \u201caren\u2019t u going to walk me to my car?\u201d I have never cursed at him or yelled or demanded much within our time together because of his ex trauma I am pretty laid back\u2026..) I could have said it nicer but I wasn\u2019t NASTY.\nI had replied something along the lines of the reasons why I wanted him to walk me to my car to begin with. Anyway he grabbed some bags and fast walked without a word and angrily to my vehicle. I tried to catch up walking fast as well with bags In my arms. It took us more than 5 min to get to the car because it was so late the pathway with shortcut was locked for the night.\nAnyway he hadn\u2019t spoken to me the whole walk, had an angry attitude and dropped my bags at the car and walked away! I tried to talk to him, he ignored me!!! He never checked if I got home ok , nothing. ( and I almost got stuck on the road because I was supposed to add fuel to my car prior to meeting his parents for dinner but since one thing led to another that didn\u2019t happen but that is not his fault). My point is he wouldn\u2019t have known because he didn\u2019t even care to see what time I got home.\nThe next day I was to blame from him for speaking in a tone. His sister even yelled at me. (He\u2019s 40, she\u2019s 44 and I\u2019m 36!) she\u2019s like you don\u2019t appreciate anything he does and that was a small thing he didn\u2019t realize blah blah. I think it\u2019s messed up I got attacked for things he does for me because I always appreciated him and his actions and I always told him and showed him in my ways as well. (His sis is bipolar I\u2019m not sure if he is, he never told me but his ex posted an article on \u201chow to deal w a bipolar spouse). Anyway\u2026 so\nNow even if I had a \u201ctone\u201d, isn\u2019t that a little extreme behavior from his end? He claimed afterwards i triggered him because it reminded him of an instance w his ex wife but Like in reality I feel like it didn\u2019t have to be so extreme.\nJust taking opinions and thoughts. Thank you\u2026\n(fast forward a few months and he went from exclaiming his love for me one evening to never speaking to me again 8 hours later. He had broken up w me via text. His sister got involved within those hours and yelled at me again)\nI never received any closure he never let me see or speak to him, I was blocked on any way to reach out to him. All this from someone who just told me how much he\u2019s in love with me and how he wants to marry me\u2026(still don\u2019t know which part of the divorce process he\u2019s in, but doesn\u2019t matter anymore). I just would like some feedback about the above scenario to anyone that is still reading. Being part of his life for a year and being in his apartment 4/7 days a week and being part of his life to being kicked out like trash without a clue is really a horrible thing to go through emotionally. I understand no one is perfect but I have been through his side no matter what all year and dealt with a lot of his anger from his ex relationship (I mean Examples of just asking him a question have led to him yelling and cursing at me bad words and claiming I\u2019m jealous like his ex, which in fact the question was not even about jealousy or drama related) that\u2019s why I feel like even if I did have a tone this was uncalled for?

But when I ask him about the same he replies, its OK \u2026 I work hard so that my wife and daughters can live happily.\nSince lockdown, my husband is able to sleep peacefully. His dark circles have reduced. I love to watch him sleeping. Its been years he hasnt slept at night properly, and so to follow the sudden change in routine was little difficult for him. Whenever he tries to catch a sleep i have seen him suddenly waking up and gasping for air. So to reduce the stress I make sure I place my hand on his chest. He said it is helping him and I am Happy I could help him. And the relationship part, we are able to spend more time with each other and with our daughters. He loves cooking and serving, he helps me with my chores. He takes very good Care of my daughters.\nBy the end of lock down, everything will change but we know \u2018once upon a time during Corona\u2019 life had really changed into a beautiful fairytale.", "This week started with the usual routine.

I on the other hand very much an extrovert. I'm tall and pretty and he looks okay I guess.\nIt's like for the first time in two years I am realising he may not be what I want. It's not like he is a bad person just that he is not what I looked forward for. I know I can make do with him but I want to enjoy my married life. I want to like to spend time with him. It's boring with him because he is reserved. He needs someone to plan everything, someone to decide. He will never initiate or do anything spontaneous. Im more quirky.\nI know all these sound stupid against actual things which happen in our society. But I feel trapped. I know what me and husband have is an okay thing not the best thing. I sometimes feel shy to keep our pictures as any profile photo because he doesn't match my charm. Even though I'm married I still have a lot of guys hit on me. But here is my husband who keeps saying I have put on weight after marriage etc etc. He is not even bothered how he looks. It matters to me. He doesn't care to complement me or care to pamper me. Im not asking for it everyday but sometimes would be nice. If I ask him he says it doesn't come to him naturally.\nWhenever I introduce him to my friends he doesn't even speak anything.

Im a people person he isn't.\nI really don't know. He is very proud of me and shows me off to all his friends colleagues and everyone. Who ever speaks to me or knows me can immediately tell that I'm the smarter one and yes I could have done with a sharper and better looking guy.\nI know looks and nature is everything, atleast his behaviour is good and he is sweet.

She was getting bored so she's now connecting with all of our batch mates. Needles to say, she's also started flirting after I told her about my annual package. This girl never talked to me in school days and even on Facebook we talked only once.\nI married because my loneliness was killing me as no girl ever showed any interest in me. But now, suddenly 2 girls started flirting with me and they both are more beautiful, more educated than my wife. I connect with them both very strongly, on emotional level as well as intellectual level. My wife is innocent and she don't know what flirting, cuddling, teasing all are.

She is a Dr and was always busy with her Chamber and hospital duty.

Daughterinlaw, you see\ud83e\udd2a that too dwelling in a conservative Andhraite family\ud83d\ude04, my presence, my duties towards the elders of the family, my responsibilities, my attitude, my culture, my upbringing mattered than my husband's presence.\nSince he is an optical networking engineer, the demand for optical fibre design worldwide has increased as people across the globe are working from home and there is a huge demand for Internet services and hence, his work increased to the core.\nAs I have seen him busy throughout my 5 years of marital life, I have got adjusted to him, his schedule, his family, his relatives, his sis and family too and more than anything, I have got adapted to his work culture and timings than his presence, initially, it was difficult but now that I know what they are, I fulfil the expectations of his family members even I get freelance projects, I complete within the deadline. I change my sleep pattern when people are in more numbers at my home. It's better to bend a little and adjust than to get blamed is my policy. I don't mind people objecting me but in a family of 2 or more, people try to judge the new bride and they will continue doing but I didn't want to be judged more and calling me names, showing my in capabilities, so I learnt so many things for my marital happiness, to keep myself away from my stress, my peace of mind, to keep my maternal and marital life happier.

This was the first time I was working from home and hence things started getting messier at home.\nBefore starting my office work I always completed my part of household activities and let the others do the rest of the day as I would be busy with my work. To my disappointment MIL wanted me to be in the kitchen in evening as well whenever she and elder DIL used to be in kitchen which wasn\u2019t possible for me. Daily they use to make some different delicacies in food in the evening apart from normal food like dosa, pao bhaji etc. Somehow my MIL doesn\u2019t say anything to elder DIL she just does whatever she says.

In the beginning he used to sit with me in the room while I used to work but with days went by he was always sitting with somebody or the other like his brother, mother, father which made me started missing him during the day. I had a plan to try for pregnancy at this time of the year but nothing happened between us. We stopped being intimate or even touch each other. On my job part, I was getting a few regular deadlines which made me work for long hours in the night as well on some unusual days but it was not regular.\nOne day in the night, I finished my work at 9:00 pm and was about to have dinner to which I heard my MIL saying secretively to my BIL that I\u2019m getting too much work these days and don\u2019t know what I keep doing the whole day. I came out of the room suddenly and my MIL got to know that I have heard everything by this time I was really angry on her that even after taking care of my household responsibilities she is blaming me or speaking negative to other people in the house. The moment she got to know that I had heard everything now comes her double face identity. She changed her words then and there. I was so pissed off with her attitude. I slept angrily and in the morning she called me in her room. My husband was already sitting with her. She had told him the whole story that happened last night. My husband didn\u2019t knew the whole story that happened, he just knew the crux. She asked me what is the problem with me, why am I behaving in such a way, I told her that I don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore as you say something on one person\u2019s face and something else on other. To which she got angry and said me a few things. At this time as there were issues between me and my husband also he became angry with me despite of not knowing the other side of the story.\nSome arguments happened between all and my MIL called my mother that she is sending me home which was supported by my husband also. I called up my father and told him the whole story, he came to pick me up. My parental house is just 2\u20133 mins walk from my in-laws house. I\u2019m at my home right now, didn\u2019t get a call even from my husband nor from anyone and I also didn\u2019t call anybody.\nThese situations have been prevailing since a long time now and it\u2019s getting difficult for me to stay as a wroking woman in the house. I\u2019m not saying that I may be right always but when somebody hurts my sentiments on me being a working woman and not understanding my challenges with the work life balance I start protecting my identity. Yes, I am an ambitious woman because I have worked day and night to achieve something in life and I totally respect it no matter whether someone else\u2019s does that or not.\nRight now my parents are really afraid because of whatever has happened and I don\u2019t know how shall I react on my part. I miss my husband but I do not want to talk to him due to the way he reacted the other day and supported his mother for sending me home. Ours was a love marriage and had thought that things will be easier but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen anytime soon. Living in a joint family is another big challenge where there\u2019s a lot of comparisons involved between two DILs.\nWill be waiting for their call or my husband\u2019s else will call him here at my place and speak to him infront of my parents to sort out everything because I believe if his parents have the right to speak to me regarding such situations at home, my parents also have the right on the same terms.\nApology for such a long answer but the current scenario that happened is really getting me into slow depression and stress.

One week into the lockdown, I came to know that I was 4 weeks pregnant.. My husband did not allow me to do any work after I shared the happy news with him. Even small things matter a lot.. He would wake up, and log in desktop for me so that I dont have to bend down to turn on the switch. He would cook and clean for me. He took care of me so well that I dint even miss my parents not being here. I was really happy and grateful that I had such a wonderful husband..\nThe happiness did not last long for us..

I kept having this dreadful feeling that something was not right.. the next day, we went to the ER. The doctor diagnosed me with a miscarriage. I was devastated to hear the news.. My husband stood strong by my side. I could visibly see how heart broken he was, but he held me like a baby when I cried my heart out at the ER.. he had to support and take me to the car and to our home. I felt so empty inside, I could not think about anything else for 2 days. My husband forced me to eat and tried his best to make me smile and forget our loss..\nWe made the mistake of informing my pregnancy to our parents as soon as we knew (at 4 weeks). When we informed his parents, my mother in laws first words were \u201cwe haven't even heard about a miscarriage in our family.. this must be something hereditary from your side\". I was already heartbroken, and I felt like someone punched me when I heard this.. my husband took my side and supported me..\nIt's only been a couple of days since I miscarried, but I feel much stronger now. I am still very upset, but because of my husband's support, I know that this is not the end. There is still hope and everything will be alright soon.. I feel blessed to have such a wonderful partner by my side.. The doctor has advised me to rest for a week. My husband still takes care of me like I am a baby. I have tears in my eyes as I am writing this.. My husband is truly my pillar of support and the love of my life.. In spite of everything bad that is going on in this world including the virus and the lockdown. we have become closer.. our parents are not able to visit us, we are not able to go out and meet our friends.. this sad situation could have ended up bitter and could have ruined our relationship..

Yet her own desire to control me pushed me away rather than let it happen naturally.\nRight off the bat she asked for things like a promise ring yet this made me very mad because I just met her and I am a loyal person so when I tell someone I'm with them, they don't have to worry. But by me being strong to her it made her feel like I would leave her. She told me she was afraid I'd leave her or she wasn't good enough.\nInsecure people want to control you. They fear you'll leave and they fear being alone. She hates being alone and always needs attention. She doesn't get attention from her family and that makes her seek it elsewhere.\nThat need for attention, fear of being alone, fear of being cheated on, fear of being abandoned is exactly why some cheaters cheat. Not all cheaters but in her case why she does.\nShe's afraid, she's insecure, her life is so damaged from her past that she fears the most things never working out which leads to unhealthy habits to control and manipulate others that only ultimately push them away and cause exactly what she doesn't want to happen, to happen.", "I did it because I had the opportunity to become intimate with someone else (actually multiple people) whom I found to be attractive. What did I learn from it?;\nI learned how fun it is to explore my sexuality. I learned how resentful I feel when involved with someone whom I feel is trying to control my body and sexuality.\nI also learned what a strain it is to be in a relationship with someone who expects and demands monogamy. In all of my subsequent relationships I have always made my views on monogamy clear from the beginning. It saves me from having to sneak around later on. I also give my partners the freedom to be with other people, so it gives us one less thing to fight over.\nI have very easy laidback relationships."], "topic_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 16, 2020", "question_author": "Sarah Nguyen", "view_list": [4600, 428], "upvote_list": [13, 1], "name_list": ["Bob Arthur", "Wilford Fraser"]}, "41": {"no_of_view": "867", "date_list": ["Apr 10, 2020", "Apr 10, 2020", "Apr 10, 2020", "Apr 9, 2020", "Apr 9, 2020", "Apr 9, 2020"], "question_title": "What does this mean?

It is like this - if we are thirsty, no amount of soda or drinks, hard or soft, can satisfy us - temporarily maybe, but ultimately we need water.\nA fickle person is just as much on his search for God as is a steady person. It is just that the fickle one has not found a close match to God and the steady one found somebody similar to his God. But all relative relationships will wither away some day or the other, because \u201csimilar\u201d is not \u201csame\u201d. Ultimately the heart and the soul will not tolerate any shortcoming in relationships. All these relationships in this world are like passengers on a train. If you like the person sitting beside you, you make a connection - a temporary one, otherwise you stay quiet. At the end of the journey everybody will disperse to their respective destinations. It would be foolish to give your heart to a person you just met in the train. We think we know a person by living with them for long, but what is a matter of hours in a train is the same as decades on this earth - by the end of the journey we are none the wiser about the other person. The only person we know is ourselves and our own thoughts, desires and aspirations - which may change but we don\u2019t blame ourselves generally because we are implicitly privy to the justifications for such change and which others probably would never understand. That gives a clue to God - the eternal companion - this is the real deal - God is the one before whom you stand stark naked - it is not vulnerability, but the relief we have always sought - the one who knows everything \u2014 but without judgment and with all empathy and love in existence poured unto you.\nWhy are we created like this?

He needs to wear closed shoes at his job & boots with his uniform when he goes to his Army Reserves.\nBut he goes barefoot with me all the time, & at our wedding I was a barefoot bride & he was a barefoot groom.", "Less, far less than I do. In fact my wife used to be livid over the fact that, no matter what I would wear (with the exception of formal attire), from ankle to toe I am completely bare, both inside and outside the house, including cold weather. In warmer weather when she has on flip flops, sandals or flats without socks, once in the house, she\u2019ll remove them and be barefoot for a few minutes before pulling on a pair of socks. The one other time she\u2019s barefoot is when relaxing to the TV in the bedroom or course when we\u2019re turning in for the night. Other than that for her, it\u2019s socks or slippers in the house and shoes outside. However it was from October to April when things would start to tense up since it was then that she would start wearing shoes or boots according to the fall and winter fashion with socks always while my feet remained completely and perpetually bare.\nTo placate her, when going out I put on a pair of slip on shoes, and once in the car, or at the venue my feet happily slip out of their shoes, which I then push off to the side. To see us presentably dressed, with her sporting her semi-casual ankle boots and socks against my bare ankles and feet without any footwear in sight is a regular site for many.\nAfter so many years, she has generally become more accepting and used to it. While I\u2019m pretty comfortable with being barefoot around others, she prefers to have her shoes on when we have company at our house or we\u2019re at someone else\u2019s place. What makes it easier is beforehand, she\u2019ll casually find a way to sneak in the fact that I\u2019m always barefoot.

If she needs to go out to the car to get something, she\u2019ll ask me sometimes if she\u2019s not in the mood to put her shoes on, since she knows I don\u2019t mind going outside barefoot. A glass will break, and rather than telling me to put on shoes, she\u2019ll just tell me to be careful.\nI often notice, and also reading from the answers in this thread, in a male/female couple, it is usually the female who is barefoot more. Movies, magazines and advertisements will often show photos of an elegant or casual couple where the female is barefoot while the male is wearing shoes and socks, thus society has taught that it is somehow more acceptable for the female to be barefoot and the male to be shod. However, with me it\u2019s been the other way around with not only my SO wearing the shoes, but in previous relationships as well where at a gathering or party I would be barefoot while my girlfriend and all our friends and others surrounding us would all have on shoes and socks.

I would like to believe that the main reason why shoes are not removed in public is because most people\u2019s feet stink and in most cases their stockings are tone.

As I state in my book, researchers and psychologists have found that unhealthy, or traumatic, bonding occurs between people in an abusive relationship. The bond is stronger for people who have grown up in abusive households because it seems a normal part of the relationship. Initially, there is an intensity not matched in the earlier relationships of the victim\u2019s life with the parent. It is claimed the longer a relationship continues, the more difficult it is for the victim to leave the abuser with whom they have bonded.\nIf the abuse is severe, it can be like Stockholm Syndrome, which is a condition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity. These bonds are formed between captor and captives during intimate time together but are generally considered irrational considering the danger endured by the victims.\nPhysical and emotional abuse during childhood is often present in the context of betrayal trauma. Research has found that child sexual abuse leads to significant disruption in one\u2019s emotional life. The degree or severity of the abuse as well as abuse by a caregiver or close relative can influence the response to trauma.\nThe intermittent reinforcement of attention then criticism/demeaning is also addicting. It is important to break free of a narcissist. There can be no good or healthy relationship coming from it. I have some healing techniques that may help. Here is the list. This is the beginning, there are more to be found under my profile.\nHire a therapist that knows about abuse\nScreen them and even interview them to see if they have had clients who have suffered this kind of abuse, as it is really known only if experienced.\nBecome wise on the topic.\nFind out for sure if you are in such a relationship by reading books about the topic, YouTube videos by psychologists, and answers on Quora on the topic.\nLeave safely.\nOnce you have established that you are in such a relationship, set up plans to leave. Go no contact on all social media and all phones and accounts. Do this the same day you leave the relationship. If you have property or children together, hire an attorney.\nPractice being loyal to yourself first\n\u201cThere is never a day where it is better to be in a relationship that undermines, undercuts, manipulates, abuses or takes advantage of us than it is to be \u2026in a relationship with ourselves that\u2019s filled with self-love.\u201d A statement of self-love could be said every day in addition to other ways of caring for yourself such as relaxation, eliminating negative self-talk, taking yourself out to dinner, or putting fun in every day. The statement is pledging allegiance to yourself and honoring your gifts, talents, and goodness. Commit to being loyal to yourself from now on.\nCreate and set Boundaries.\nPractice with friends first but if you\u2019re a people pleaser, setting and sustaining boundaries can seem overwhelming, or worse, impossible. So commit to creating one boundary, and seeing it through. Start small. And remember, \u201cBeing good, as it turns out, isn\u2019t about pleasing. Being good is about being just to others while also being true to yourself.\u201d\nSpend time with yourself for a while until you regain your balance.\nDon\u2019t try to rush out and date or meet lots of new people. You are healing from a trauma and you will not be in any shape to do anything but lean on friends and use some simple healing techniques. Treat yourself as a sick person who is convalescing.\nPractice good self- care.\nThis is related to loving yourself but basically means: get a good night\u2019s sleep, eat well, exercise, and do some socializing with safe and gentle people. A good support network is also recommended or community such as a church, women\u2019s group or even a hobby group.\nJournal.\nThis can be tied to a gratitude journal or just keeping a journal of your emotions and how you have changed over time once you are out of the relationship.\nWalk in Nature.\nThis practice is easy to do--connect to nature, and if a forest is available, take in its atmosphere. Walking in nature is an easy practice that can start with the mountain yoga pose and then walking in nature.\nPets. Borrow or find a rescue pet.\nStroking a cat or dog can be very healing. Support animals are even better. I could not have survived without my support cat.

But isn\u2019t it is said that. \u201cThe quality of the question you ask, it determines who you are.\u201d\nThe very word \u2018 Relationship\u2019 is very pure, integrated, committed and respectable. But in today\u2019s modern world has changed the meaning of relationship.\nTherefore an Oxford Dictionary explains the meaning of \u201cflirt\u201d is -\nTo behave towards somebody as if you find them sexually attractive, without seriously wanting to have a relationship with them\nSo, there will be no seriousness in relationship when you flirt. According to my understandings, when you flirt with any opposite gender that doesn\u2019t mean you would have a serious relationship with him/her. It\u2019s just to have a bodily pleasure, bodily taste to gratify your taste buds. Relationship is very committed and respectable position where two people come together to serve each other and help each other.\nMany times, we think that If I am not flirting than I am not a cool bro. Here, I can use the flirt word as a \u201cmediocre-living\u201d where a person misunderstands the word relationship and indulge in mediocre satisfaction which has the end. So, here is my first part of the answer is No. The word \u2018Flirting and relationship\u2019 are two different things wherein today\u2019s so-called world misunderstands.\nI want to add one thing that flirting will not create genuine relationship, it will bring divorce in that relation. Because as soon as you flirt with someone, that doesn\u2019t mean that you are only flirting with another gender, that person also flirting with someone else. Right? So this flirting business can only rise problems like divorce, unwanted sex, pollute their pure progeny, etc. Acharyas or spiritual teachers reject this illicit relation or flirting relation.\nHere, Prabhupada explains in his letters depicting that the very word flirting means illicit relationship -\nRejection of illicit sex life is our first motto. So I request you to stop immediately all this nonsense and remain fixed up in your good character. I have got very much appreciation of your abilities and I hope you will do the needful so that there may not be any more accusation against your good character. Any god-brother's wife or any unmarried girl in our society should be always treated as mother and sister. Any married woman should be treated as a mother. - Srila Prabhupada in his Letter to Vasudeva -- Nairobi 14 October, 1971\nA Varnasrama is the foundation to built a genuine meaningful relationship. The Relationship must not be confused with a flirty attitude. Again, I mention here Flirt and relationship is two opposite things where flirt attitude creates the problem and it destroys your relationship and Genuine relationship in the guidance of devotees is to seek that makes fulfillment in both of their life and it helps both to come together to serve each other.\nI will end my answer by sharing Prabhupada words -\nOur Srila Prabhupada (founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness) explains in his one of his class that -\nNo illicit sex. You cannot have illicit sex life. Here I have gotten married all these boys and girls. I don't allow to live as a boyfriend, girlfriend. No. (laughter) That is not allowed. in our society. All these married girls and boys, they have been married by me. Perhaps that is the first instance that a sanny\u0101s\u012b is creating householders. (laughter). Sanny\u0101s\u012b creates sanny\u0101s\u012b. People are afraid of mixing with sanny\u0101s\u012b because they think that \"A sanny\u0101s\u012b will make me a sanny\u0101s\u012b.\" But actually, that fear is not here. Here is a sanny\u0101s\u012b who is creating g\u1e5bhasthas.\nOne should not have more than one woman or one man. That is nice. And therefore in human society there is marriage. Not in the animal society. Married means that one should be satisfied with one woman and one man. That's all. And there is no question of divorce. Divorce is introduced by the modern rascals, but it is not sanctioned by any religious person. You see? So we are observing these rules: no illicit sex life, no meat-eating, no intoxication, no gambling. So all my students, they strictly follow these rules, and therefore they're advancing so quickly. Yes. You see the advancement so quickly because they follow my instruction. They follow very obediently. - Excerpt from Prabhupada Initiation Lecture -- London, August 22, 1971\nMessage to you in short - Don\u2019t fall in illicit sex or flirting attitude. It will eventually bring destruction in your life. So seek genuine relationship in the guidance of senior Vaishnavas/devotees/guide/mentor, who can help you to build how to build commitment by which you can succeed in your material life and spiritual life.\nHope you got your answer!\nFor more Gaur Gopal Das | Monk, Author, Filmmaker has beautifully explained about meaningful Relationship here - Gaur Gopal Das' hilarious take on love, hook-ups and social media | KasaKai Mumbai\nThank you very much\nHare Krishna", "Commonly, people understand flirting as something people only do when they're trying to get an attractive person into their bed, or into a relationship on social media platform.

It will help others and make you feel good about yourself. You will also meet people who share enjoying the things you care about. You will be sharing love.\nExpand your social, political, educational, religious and/or spiritual circles. Meet new people and share your time and energies for causes you believe in and people you like. Remove negative people and experiences from your life.\nFind new interests, dreams and goals. Your choices should make you happy, even passionate. Life is meant to be joyful, suffering only endured when absolutely necessary.\nEnjoy the outdoors with hikes or nature walks. You can join a club and hike or walk with others who share your love of nature. Who doesn\u2019t love a beautiful meadow or mountain, or even a nice walk around a neighborhood? And exercise strenuously daily. It will release endorphins, stimulate your heart and lungs, give you energy and impetus to do more with your life, and increase your level of happiness.\nAdopt a pet - a cat, dog, horse, ferret, rabbit, snake, lizard, guinea pig, hamster, a small animal or other living creature to give you unconditional love. Being responsible for another life, and the love and commitment that brings, can be life enhancing. And if you go to a shelter to find one, you will be giving a loving animal a home and perhaps you will be moved to volunteer there!\nJoin a church, synagogue, mosque, or other religious or spiritual center. And by the way, you don\u2019t have to believe in God to do so, but you will meet good people.\nTake classes in real classrooms - art, pottery, cooking, philosophy, psychology. You will be pursuing your creative and intellectual growth and you will meet creative, intelligent, stimulating, active people who are also seeking new experiences and new friends.

This type of thinking is representative of many Analyst types, especially INTJs. Linear thinking helps to pull things out of context to explore them. But then, non-linear thinking is needed to add context and see the bigger picture.\nThis linear form of thinking inadvertently spills into INTJs\u2019 approach to romantic relationships. And of course, \u201cwhen applying non-living world systems to the living, we can make mistakes\u201d.\nHere\u2019s some examples:\n\u201cFirst this, then that\u201d mentality can cause some INTJs to delay romance all together. \u201cI\u2019d like to date her, but I have so much to do right now to finish my degree, that I can\u2019t possibly think of starting something else\u201d. In contrast, non-linear thinking recognizes that this is a complex situation that requires non-linear thinking. Non-linear thinking would suggest that one can work on step 1 and step 10 in tandem.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not safe\u201d mentality can dissuade INTJs from trying different things. \u201cShe\u2019s nice, seems interested, and makes me feel differently, but she seems to not be totally transparent and could be hiding something. She\u2019s unpredictable, and if I can\u2019t have complete transparency why bother telling her or fighting for this\u201d. Non-linear thinking would suggest that additional information is needed to make a determination on this person\u2019s character, and that looking at this in a vacuum could produce a mistake.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d mentality suggests that something doesn\u2019t fit, so it doesn\u2019t have use right now. \u201cIt\u2019s not obvious to me how I fit in her life, or what she wants from me, so I can\u2019t see this working\u201d. Non-linear thinking suggests that some experimentation is needed, maybe a round of trial and error before concluding on an intuition without experimental data; it says \u201ctry it on, you might like it\u201d.\n\u201cI need to finish the task at hand\u201d mentality can be very good and sometimes it can be a saboteur because it doesn\u2019t allow INTJs to move on from a seemingly unrequited crush and cut their losses. Other times, this steadfastness makes INTJs very valuable for their commitment and reliability.\nMore points could be added, but will conclude by saying that there is nothing inherently wrong about linear thinking, but it has to exist in a bigger non-linear system. We don\u2019t want to apply linear thinking to situations that are non-linear.\nIf you are emboldened by this, go ahead, break order and pursue your dreams, whatever they may be.

relationships, can someone explain to me how they work?", "no_of_follower": 5, "respond_collected": 7, "ans_list": ["hi, today people call many things love, and they are not at all love.. many are opposite of love.. here is one scientific theory of love, called triangular theory of love..\nplease have a look..\ntoday\u2019s world is getting more and more narcissistic, especially western world, so for anyone to achieve good long lasting loving connection with another person (soul to soul connection, highest form of human love possible), both of them must be good and mature loving individuals, complete as they are, on their own.. capable of living life independently..\nwe all have our inner insecurities, made in early childhood, and how our childhood wounds fit with another person\u2019s childhood wounds is very important.. no one is perfect, but if we help other person\u2019s deep wounds heal, we are a good fit, if we make their hidden inner wounds even worse, that relationship will not be good, and will not last, or even if it lasts both persons would be unhappy..\nwe learn from our parents about the world we live in and about love.. for example if a man had a weak father and a dominant mother, who preferred him compared to his siblings, and he became very narcissistic himself, and finds a wife who had a narcissistic father (cold and dominant person, emotionally unavailable) their marriage could work out, if husband is a strong person, able to face life challenges, and take the role of head of the family (but his father never did so, so chances are he also can not do so).. if he is weak, he will eventually seek his mother in his wife, he would want his wife to solve things, and be dominant (and she will be forced to take a lead, since he is failing at that role), and at the same time he will hate her for being such, for being better and stronger person than he is, and he will want to be the \u201cboss\u201d, and that will create a very unhealthy and conflicting situation, since he will subconsciously and consciously sabotage her in all ways (as a person, regarding her dreams, job, family goals, even regarding their children\u2019s wellbeing, etc).. he will try to punish his wife for the wrongs that he saw his mother doing to his father, even though, wife has nothing to do with that, and is not the same person as his mother, plus he is a weak person in other aspects as well (most probably prone to cheating) and it all leads to a family disaster.. he will ignore and hate her, and she will despise him..\nor if a woman had a narcissistic father and became a narcissist herself, and has found a weak man (who\u2019s father was abusive, and who\u2019s mother was very controlling, but still under the father\u2019s thumb) to be able to control him (since she couldn't control her father), after some time she will start hating and despising him for being a weak person.. and he will hate her also, since in his eyes she is not good enough as wife, mother, cook, etc as his mother was, and becouse she puts herself above him.. etc..\nmany possible cases are there.. but, in most cases emotionally unavailable father (absent, working abroad, or present but not very loving) leads to woman being \u201chungry\u201d for love, and entering a relationship perhaps too fast.. and ending up broken later.. emotionally unavailable husbands are not bad just for the wives, but for the children as well.. and having a cold and dominant demanding mother often leads to a man finding unloving wife, who most of all wants to use him financially..\nso, we should analyze our parents marriages, and see how we turned out to be, and try to avoid making huge mistakes with our own future marriage.. and be aware of our own inner wounds and insecurities, and try to heal them, before we enter a relationship with someone else.. self love is the most important thing.. those who love themselves, in a healthy way, will not be so easily fooled and taken advantage of by bad people..\nso when seeking a life partner, we should seek someone loving.. close to God.. not just by words, but in reality, by the way a person lives their life.. loving person can give love.. unloving can not.. it is as simple as that..\nand we already have some image of what we need, in our subconscious and conscious mind.. and when we meet someone new, in first few seconds we unconsciously fit them in our \u201cideal partner template\u201d and see do they fit or not.. that is why parents are so important and how they treated each other (and us).. with how much love.. if a girl had very narcissistic father, most probably her husband will also be a narcissist.. because for her being treated badly is \u201clove\u201d.. she knew nothing better.. and then after 5-15\u201320 y of marriage, that she thought was ok, when she suddenly finds out her husband is cheating on her, then she will have a painful awakening, and realize that being ignored and abused is not love.. and if she is strong enough she will grow from that situation and learn that she is good enough and worthy of true love.. etc.. I know several such true life stories.. what is sad when that happens is that most such women feel it is then too late for them to start their life from the beginning.. but, it is never too late..\nso, for you young people, my advice would be, don't rush.. don't get into a relationship because you are bored, or feel pressured by your friends, or family.. give yourself time to grow, as a person, be strong, independent, on your own, don't start a relationship as a way to escape something bad (bad parents, bad job, bad life..).. be happy, fulfilled, on your own first, then find another equally good and happy and emotionally mature person.. and create a nice loving relationship.. when people connect from despair and misery, even if the relationship is good at the beginning, it will later fail.. some people enter relationships because of their selfish interests.. sex, money, etc.. so anyone who is serious about love should keep their eyes open and not be tricked and fooled by such people.. I know several beautiful females, who got humiliated and betrayed after years of marriage, by those who swore to love them the most..\nso, what is important is integrity.. how capable of living up to their own words people are.. some are not at all honest, sincere, or capable of being strong human beings.. many are shallow, immature, insecure, foolish, and weak cowards.. even many of those who look serious, hardworking, righteous, etc only look like that, and inside they are empty and unloving..\nbe honest and loving.. towards everyone, you included.. if your image of yourself is fake, or twisted, you can not see others properly also.. so, what you can do is love yourself, that is the most important thing.. that will make you strong, and it will make your subconscious \u201cimage\u201d of your ideal partner the best one for the real you..\nthen, give your best shot at love, and hope it will all turn out well.. someone who enters a relationship aiming low will definitely fail.. we have limited time here.. and each second of our life is precocious.. so, use your time well, don't waste it on shallow unloving people, and on unimportant activities..\ngood luck!!!", "There's no rules as far as love relationships go as the love needs to be unconditional,just let your partner know what you really feel,be honest with them and yourself,note that love is never proud.\nIt's a relationship of give & take for both people, take your time with it,in a love relationship a partner might say something hurtful in the heat of the moment but the other partner will always forgive them out of love !", "its cool to be clueless your only 18,\u2026love relationships work like this once the two of you hook up your suppose to include him or her in all your during and after school plans when possible & your constantly on the phone together sharing everything that happened during the day in eachothers absence and you tell eachother at nausim how much you love eachother,\u2026thats the cliffnotes explanation", "Relationships are complicated.

Sad, but unfortunate, I believe people have no alternative but to finally acknowledge and deal with the fact that they are with a narc.\nAs predictable as a narc is with their behavior and treatment of others, it is easy to ignore and make excuses for them, when you are not around them as much. Schools are closed, workers are at home, children cannot attend daycare, no restaurants, no bar scene, stay-at-home orders, hence, the days become very long, when one cannot move around from place to place. This movement is a necessity for a narc to get supply and feed their never-ending self-indulgences. When the world is forced to stop and remain in one place, this is extremely stressful for the narc. Narcs need variety and constant supply - from the waiter to the gas station attendant to their partner - in order to ensure they are recognized, adored and worthy. When the narc\u2019s supply is limited or depleted, they cannot handle this. They have very low self-esteem and a very low opinion of themselves, that\u2019s why they wear a mask and mirror their primary supply.\nWith limited interactions, the narc cannot successfully and continually wear their masks and it begins to slip off. As the mask slips, the true character of the narc begins to show. Compare the narc\u2019s behavior to a feral animal. As long as the animal can find food, shelter and wander freely, it is fine. Put the animal in a box and it becomes uncontrollable and irate. The narc, in essence, is in a box (stay-at-home order). Now the narc must adhere to a boundary or a rule.\nNow look at the audience (spouse, kids for example), they are forced to share the same environment with the narc during this time. The shared space will quickly become unbearable because the narc has no tolerance for boundaries. The audience is now forced to deal with the narc\u2019s behavior, whereas before, they didn\u2019t have to since the narc had the freedom to wander round.

If we start a new romantic relationship and our girlfriend/boyfriend either responds slower than before or not at all it is so very informative.\nMost likely scenario is that we have been texting our partner too much! The content of the text messages has become predictable. Think about this from the female perspective. Most females are bombarded with text messages.\nThis is especially true of attractive females. Men are hitting them up all of the time. When the female enters a new romantic relationship things change. If she's a good girlfriend, then potential suitors will be informed of her relationship status.\nNow if you make the same mistakes I've made (and that most males do), you'll have become more of a nuisance! Texting should only really be used to set up future dates. I do accept with the current situation that texting has become more important.\nBut in general terms the female does NOT welcome too much texting from her boyfriend. Females instinctively know that most of this texting is just \u2018checking in' texting. Nonsense texts such as \u2018I was wondering how you are' etc.\nTexting to seek reassurance and validation is quickly detected by the female. I kid you not, many relationships are ruined by texting and insecurity. Less is more!\nEventually the female gets sick. It is all so predictable. When the world returns to something like normality, keep the communication face to face. Let the female breathe as far as texting goes. Let her come to you!\nTexting too much is CHASING! Chasing her away. Attraction levels are diminished. Let the female start to miss you. I wonder why he hasn't text so far today? Is he going off me? Be a challenge not a text pest!\nSo in answer to your question: The female gets bored by such predictability. You text more you're less of a challenge. Females love the drama and challenge that the non constant texting male brings to the table.\nKeep your texts to a minimum. Only text when setting up a date should be your focus. She may well be losing interest of course. But can you blame her? Texting is for females to females is my belief. They love that!\nYou are her alpha male. You are a challenge to her NOT a text buddy!

An answer that can\u2019t be proved right or wrong, so all I have to offer is my opinion.\nNo, I don\u2019t believe it is. Capitalism was never designed to be a scheme to protect health for once-in-a-century problems that only now with global air travel is much more likely to occur more often. The seeds of capitalism were growing long before airplanes were created. In fact, airplane technology is a result of capitalism, so the current global travel environment is also an offshoot of capitalism.\nThe method that most of society has been using to deal with problems of this nature was to put in place a team of experts on health and epidemiologists. The WHO (World Health Organization) is performing an adequate job for most of the world\u2019s coordination in this issue. In the USA (where I am familiar with), we have the CDC, which can call on the help of FEMA, the US military, and other national organizations to provide assistance.\nWe have had a special White House team that coordinated with 40+ international offices that kept a lookout all over the globe for such problems. These experts developed detailed plans to handle as best as they could predict what was needed to be done quickly to fend off the next viral epidemic.\nSadly, Americans were conned into electing a president that knew nothing about science, management, or government, and had no interest in learning anything about these matters. Several years ago most of these offices were de-funded and closed out of ignorance. So the USA had no plan in place, no agency to handle the early warning signs, and no effective leadership. Combined with a refusal to do what needs to be done, our president had even to this day April 10, 2020, failed to place an experienced leader to handle this crisis.\nIf the country that could land a man on the moon could not manage this problem, it seems natural that less developed, less wealthy countries had as much of a chance to effectively manage this crisis. Some have minimized the problem very well (North Korea, Germany, and even China to some degree), most haven\u2019t. I suspect it\u2019s because most countries have leadership that is as incompetent as the USA has in handling difficult problems.\nSo the clear answer was that the current crisis in the USA and many other countries is and was a failure of government leadership in ways too numerous to mention. Capitalism is not to blame, it was not created for this type of crisis. Government is to blame, because the last administration was put in place only 3 years ago with the understanding that it would manage such a crisis."], "topic_list": ["Relationships", "COVID-19 (2019-2020)"], "create_time": "Apr 11, 2020", "question_author": "Mitchell Frizelle", "view_list": [86], "upvote_list": [1], "name_list": ["Rich DeAngelis"]}, "710": {"no_of_view": "1,569", "date_list": ["Apr 3, 2020", "Apr 1, 2020", "Mar 28, 2020", "Mar 28, 2020", "Mar 27, 2020", "Mar 27, 2020"], "question_title": "Recently I have been feeling insecure in my relationship.

So I always thought something was wrong the whole time because generally you know when something is up.\nNext because I wanted to kill my insecurities I didn't want to keep it in myself I was thinking of ways of how to eliminate it and I ran out of options because I could not hold it in anymore I read online if it is okay to ask them for help and I did tell her everything and she said she appreciates it and because she said I can talk to her about anything so I did and I could see things started to get better from there like I could feel her getting closer and I could feel her getting warmer with me until....\nIt was a Friday night and I was drinking with my colleagues, yes I got extremely high that night and I almost got into a fight and she stopped it and sent me home and it was also the day I poured out my heart to her telling her I love her and we did kiss for the second time.\nAfter that the next day I thought okay everything was better now but suddenly she became extremely cold, I know something was up because she was not acting like herself but I thought okay maybe it is just me over thinking and she did say that she was having a hangover but I just could feel something was up.\nI brushed it off first..... Then the next day was still the same this time she went radio silence on me so I reached out and ask is everything okay she said yes.\nSo I met her for breakfast and everything seemed fine but after that when we left she still was acting weird so I confronted her and said she is worried she will never feel safe with me and I assured her time will tell because that is the truth and brushed it away.\nMonday came and she said she was feeling the blues and was being cold, not know what to do I gave space and didn't really bother her till night but I knew something was up, she was getting colder and colder so I talked to her about it again and that was when she brought up the drunk night and then when I wanted to clarify and talk about it she stopped and just skipped everything into I cannot feel for you, my mind says yes but my heart says no but unfortunately I follow my heart and I of course I persuaded but I gave up after awhile. It hurt me deeply because her replies was so cold it made me feel like nothing and it really affected me.\nThe next day I was still very hurt and confuse but was trying to keep my emotions in check and was being a little distant to her to avoid things from happening but I made a mistake I went to drink at night and was making my mind to walk off because I just couldn't accept at how she made me feel like nothing and she was just so okay about it and then I called her while I was drunk I ran to her and hug her cause I saw a guy whom I was quite jealous about her hanging with and I just ask her about it because too not only that I was balancing between fearing her leaving me, getting jealous but everything that was happening and what she told me just made me become so needy and clingy like a weak pussy begging her and persuade her and she felt pressured.\nThe next day she was quite annoyed by it and I begged her for a chance which she did but still I was quite hurt as the wound was still there and I screwed it up again and she was fed up.\nI asked her for a talk and thought hard about how to apologise and came to a realisation that yes I pressured her I did, things were progressing and I thought it was my fault I screwed up everything and to make it up to her and hope everything will be okay immediately, So I bought her flowers and chocolates but it did not help at all and from the looks of her reaction I gave her space and started to do the no contact rule.\nDuring no contact I was still feeling hurt and regret and was freaking out feeling; Angry, sad, depressed all at once and decided to take a bottle of sake, head to the beach to clear my mind and right before after taking a shower I saw myself in the mirror and I was a wreck which made me realise I hated what I became.\nWhen I was at the beach thinking i realised I can't go on like this anymore, I can't keep up because I was at the brim of suicide because I felt like nothing and it hurt me so deeply I had to walk away before I actually killed myself because that is how it happened before. I then finished the sake went home and was drunk by then so I texted her but not remember what onlu vaguely. All I remembered was; I texted her and she replied she wants to be friends and I told her to fuck off then my friends came over and I went hysterical but calmed down after awhile\nThe next day I texted her a much calm response and wished her well which she read my message and didn't reply and that was 4 days ago.\nAm doing no contact now and it's been 4 days.\nI miss her, I still care about her and wonder Everytime what she is up to with a huge urge to wanting to reach out, but during these 4 days.\nI realised what happened like;\nHow she pushed me away\nHow I felt I gave up too easily\nHow she didn't even try to get to know me\nHow she kept rejecting my advances and she kept calling me bro on purpose to push me down\nHow cold she is when I pour my heart to her at the end and the start.\nHow easy she can just shut me out like I am nothing and she is okay with it.\nHow I know her friends doesn't like me, but in reality it seems she doesn't care about that.\nThe last part really hurts the most but amongst that I took realise what I like about her;\nHer independence\nHer maturity about things that makes her understanding\nHer love for food\nHer love for cooking\nHer love for travelling\nHer passion\nHer ambitions\nHer smile\nHer shyness\nHer quirkyness\nHer randomness\nHer hugs too\nHer kiss\nHer counsel\nI do want her back, I want to reach out and talk to her but I am afraid she might not like it which is why I am asking if I should or just move on, I also want to know why and the psychology behind it."], "topic_list": ["Emotional Unavailability", "Relationships", "Breaking Up", "Using Psychology in Relationships", "Understanding Emotions", "Emotions", "Relationship Advice", "Dating Advice", "Dating and Relationships", "Life Advice"], "create_time": "Apr 2, 2020", "question_author": "Joseph Seow", "view_list": [87, 75, 32, 17, 4, 88], "upvote_list": [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "name_list": ["Pedro Cardoso", "Anonymous", "Mohit Khullar", "Anonymous", "Karen Davis", "Joseph Seow"]}, "188": {"no_of_view": "324", "date_list": ["Apr 15, 2020"], "question_title": "How do you maintain a relationship in the coronavirus pandemics season?", "no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "ans_list": ["Text, phone, Skype, FaceTime.

When Substances Control | Listly List Here are some good resources to read.", "This question is a heartbreaking one I hear frequently. In short the answer is there is a tremendous amount of selfish and self-centered behavior that results form addiction. How to get it. How to not run out. How to hold withdrawal at bay.\nThese are all very time consuming endeavors. It leaves little time for concern for others. That isn\u2019t to imply addicts don\u2019t love others - they do! And, when they promise to discontinue use because the harm that they are doing others is genuine and sincere, in the moment it is made. But that moment is short lived because of the compulsion to return to using.\nFor the spouse or relation of an addict they are left confused by promises and repeated conversations that result in a return to using only shortly after extracting those promises.\nBecause true love and commitment to another as in a marriage requires a tremendous amount of compromise and consideration of the other persons needs, this makes the addict/alcoholic while in active use a poor selection for that type of relationship. In order to have a successful marriage/relationship you\u2019d have to have the ability to put the other persons needs before your own \u201con occasion\u201d. Without the ability to do this the other partner is often left feeling like they are always making concessions, excuses and ultimately capitulation to the other person and their disease of addiction. It results in anger, resentment, passive aggressive or outright aggressive behavior which eminmates from an extreme sense of frustration and helplessness.\nThere are programs such as Al-Anon or Nar-Anon, counseling, community resources etc. to assist the spouse/partner of an addict. These are advisable. The partner of an addict/alcoholic might often wonder why \u201cthey\u201d need assistance or a program if the \u201cother\u201d person is the one with the problem. The challenge here is that addiction is insidious, an all encompassing. It has the power to swallow a family whole and keep going. To the co-sufferer of someone with addiction, you\u2019ll know that last statement is not hyperbole. Therefore if the addict is incapable of admitting there\u2019s a problem and seeking assistance, it\u2019s good for someone/anyone in the family to acknowledge the problem is likely larger than extracting a true promise of abstinence/reduction from the afflicted and seek outside help.\nAt these programs the spouse/partner of an addict will learn what things, comments, actions that they may be taking that aren\u2019t only not helpful but may be exacerbating the circumstances. They learn about how actions, sometimes referred to as \u201cenabling\u201d are actually prolonging the addiction. This is done with an inadvertent misunderstanding of addiction and how powerful it is.\nI wish you and your family all the hope of finding a solution to a family problem.

If you\u2019re with someone you can\u2019t trust it just means that you are either not ready to be in a relationship with another living breathing human being who\u2019s going to make mistakes or that you are in a relationship with the wrong person. It means that you shouldn\u2019t be dating but instead using that time to heal.\nThough you may be correct in your concern, you still have to to know that the things you feel internally are solely your responsibility and your responsibility alone to heal from and deal with. He could only try and do his best. But realistically only you know what is best for you. A lot of women are raised with this idea that it is a mans job to help them get through their emotions. That is incorrect and it is very toxic thinking. A man also has his own emotional and mental health to worry about. We can\u2019t expect others to suffer with us simply because we are in pain. It is selfish and unrealistic. Even though it seems to be the norm,it\u2019s struggle love and it is always bound to end up toxic and creates relationships that are full of hurt and resentment . It isn\u2019t our partners job to suffer with us or play therapist. Even though the idea sounds nice,it suffocates the other person. Though it may not be our fault that we feel pain internally it is solely our responsibility to heal from.\nOnce you understand that, the next thing is to consider, is whether or not if this person is good for you. Maybe you should consider being with someone who reassures you all the time. But again, as a guy this is a behavior that so many men are repelled by,this need for constant reassurance just comes off as nagging or complaining,especially if you\u2019ve been given the solution to the problems you feel that you deal with. But I\u2019m sure there are men out there who would tolerate the behavior. But I\u2019m being honest here,you can\u2019t expect most guys to not eventually give up on you or see you as high maintenance even if you may not be. The thing is that it is draining to do that for a child let alone a fully grown adult. Who is intelligent enough to think and make decisions for themselves.\nThe thing is that men and women communicate differently. Women communicate to be heard,to vent and feel heard while men focus on solutions that bring results. It\u2019s not about being insensitive, it\u2019s that when a guy sees that something is bothering his partner he tries to give her solutions to her problem the same way he would do with his friends or with his own problems. In our world practical results trump idealism. We aren\u2019t given passes for not showing and proving. It becomes how we run through life. We are not afforded the freedom to bathe in idealism. No, a man has to always show and prove. That becomes the communication style for most of us. Being focused on solutions instead of emotional expressions.\nSo instead of sitting here lying to you and telling you what you want to hear without helping you see the problem like some of your girl friends would, a guy would rather give you a permanent fix so that you heal from your suffering. It shouldn\u2019t be confused with insensitivity, it\u2019s the communication style of most men that isn\u2019t going anywhere. What I think is that maybe you should consider spending time away from relationships and heal the parts of you that is so dependent on other people for \u201creassurance\u201d , it is really hinting at something much more deeper than what you feel this guy is causing. Anything you feel that he could be doing is all a result of things you feel internally, it\u2019s all you. So my advice is to be single for a bit and face yourself if you could handle it, It\u2019s okay. The more you ignore that part of you the more it reappears in yourself and in other people.", "You wont be able to trust your partner again in good times, never mind if he's done the crime and now is dismissive of you.

Plenty more trash where that one came from.", "Believe your brain. There is something wrong.\nThere are two possibilities:\nOne: (this is the most likely) He hurt you, and he clearly has not transformed himself adequately after hurting you to earn your trust. It is up to him to earn your trust\u2014-not up to you to force yourself to trust an untrustworthy man. A man who gets annoyed when his partner needs to talk about a painful event does not deserve to be trusted. If he has not yet made clear steps to transform himself after hurting you, he won\u2019t be doing that. Nothing you do can force him. This situation is sad, but hopeless. Get safe. Get out of this relationship. Move on. You can heal and build a great life, but only if you escape this man.\nTwo: (possible, but less likely) He is completely innocent and doesn\u2019t know what to do when faced with a woman with unreasonable suspicions. This could be the case if the woman suffered earlier painful situations. In this case there will be only fears\u2014no actual harm done by this partner. A woman in this situation is not yet ready for a romantic relationship. She needs to love herself enough to get professional help to overcome past injury. If this is your case, get the professional psychological counseling help you need.

There is no reason to put your life on hold because of the virus.", "I wrote this for those of us who are isolated from our partners during this crazy time.\nThe coronavirus is taking its toll on all of us. Many of us are isolated from those we love and care about because of health concerns. Those of us who are polyamorous may feel even more isolated, since we are probably limited to what partners we can interact with. Us solo poly folks and those who are just dating may not have access to anyone for intimacy or sex. Self-care is important and making sure that not only our physical, but our mental and emotional health are taken care of can be daunting. Add to that, the desire to make sure our partner(s) are taken care of and we may become overwhelmed. What do we do? How can we have healthy sex and intimacy in a time of social distancing?\nNow I realize that much of what I\u2019m going to talk about requires funds and we don\u2019t all have access to do what it takes to do all of it. However, if you\u2019re reading this, you do have internet access and while physical sex and intimacy may be unattainable, social media has made it possible for us to interact in sexy and intimate ways. Self-distancing doesn\u2019t mean zero contact, it just means zero physical contact. Get creative! Find ways to connect with those you desire by other means than in person.\nMost of us are familiar with the five love languages, words of affirmation, time, gifts, acts of service and physical touch. I suggest we start with these. Identify what your love language is (it could be a combination of several. For me it\u2019s time and touch) and what are your partner(s) love languages. Then find ways to fulfill those needs without physical contact (yes, touch is the hard one). For those of use who are isolated, letting our partners know what we need is imperative. What follows are a few ideas on how to get through all this. Share the ones that resonate with you with those who love and care about you. If you aren\u2019t sure what resonates with them, ask. Request that they participate with you in creating a long-distance intimate and sexual connection.\nWords of Affirmation: This is pretty easy. Taking the time to send texts and messages telling your loved ones how important they are to you is a given. You can also go old school and send them a letter or card detailing your desire and love for them. Use programs like Marco Polo to send videos of you speaking to each other. If they enjoy dirty and or sexy talk, make a recording talking to them that they can play during masturbation.\nTime: This means quality time. Find things you can do via social media and other platforms. Playing games, watching movies, watching porn and spending time together, even if it\u2019s online can be enriching and fulfilling. Have meals together, via Skype or Zoom. Set the time and dates and stick to them.\nGifts: While it may seem difficult to give gifts while being distance, remember, Amazon (and others) still deliver. Send cards, small gifts and things you know they\u2019ll love to them on a regular basis. They don\u2019t have to be expensive, just things that resonate with them.\nService: This is a little harder, since much of service is about being physically present. Many of the previously mentioned ideas can constitute service. Also, you can do something like order dinner and have it delivered to them. If you\u2019re not in total lock down you can bringing them dinner personally. And if you are in total lockdown you can make gift certificates of the things you\u2019ll do for them when this crisis is over.\nTouch: This is the hardest of all.

Is this normal in serious relationships?", "no_of_follower": 0, "respond_collected": 7, "ans_list": ["Well it\u2019s less a matter of is it normal, versus is it desirable and optimal for you?\nSome people love codependency and they enjoy having one partner with whom they do everything with. This is their optimal arrangement and it can be healthy and functional for them.\nIf however you\u2019re feeling starved of space and autonomy, then this is entirely reasonable. If you want to have some activities that you do with friends, or some days you dedicate to family, this is a reasonable need and request.\nOur relationships should not take over our lives, they should enhance them. This means maintaining the things that matter to us, and maintaining our friendships and networks.\nI find it common for couples who move in together to get into this dynamic. Moving in together requires you to alter and adapt your boundaries. If this is not done deliberately- then it is common to have this over-involvement.\nIf you\u2019re slipping into codependency and feel cut of from your networks- be proactive about this. Reserve some activities or times for friends and family. A relationship should never come at the cost of your social network.\nCommunicate your needs and feelings- and let her know that you need some space and time with other people. Let her know it is not a matter of loving her less- it is just you needing to regain balance in your life. Time apart is also an incredible thing for relationships. I see many couples who take the other for granted because they are always around. Giving each other some space and time to miss each other can be useful.\nAnd it is critical to maintain your own independence and autonomy from the relationship. Be interdependent. Have your own life and identity, and share in the things you want the other person to be a part of. Being defined by a relationship can be a very dangerous game. It\u2019s something codependents love, but it can feel like you\u2019ve lost your identity and freedom for others.\nCommunicate. Work on finding a balance between togetherness and separation that is optimal. As a woman- I know that females tend to need that validation that the space isn\u2019t an outgrowth of less love or doubt on your end. Be clear that you still love her and want the relationship- but you also need to have your autonomy and invest in your friends and family. Having that conversation is necessary. Be deliberate about your time together. It is healthy and functional to develop new boundaries as a relationship evolves.", "It\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d in the sense that it\u2019s very, very common. It\u2019s not \u201cnormal\u201d in the sense that it\u2019s not a healthy way to be in a relationship.\nIsolation is one of the primary tools of abuse. Abusers isolate their victims because if their victims have other people around who they trust and are intimate with, then those other people might be able to convince them to stand up to their abuser or leave them.\nI\u2019m not saying that your relationship, in particular, is abusive. I\u2019m saying that abusers know how important other intimate relationships are, so they seek to cut their victims off from them.\nThe lesson here is that other intimate relationships outside of your primary romantic relationship are important. It\u2019s incredibly necessary to have friends and family with whom you have *independent* relationships from your partner. This doesn\u2019t mean having *secret* relationships, or people in your life that your partner isn\u2019t allowed to meet or know. It means having relationships that, if you and your partner were to split up right now, those friendships would still exist, because you have a connection to them that does not depend on your connection to your partner.\nIt\u2019s vitally important that you start reconnecting with your friends and family again, without your partner, and that she do the same with hers. Again, this isn\u2019t \u201cexclusive\u201d, this isn\u2019t keeping separate lives, compartmentalizing, or hiding anything. But all relationships need one-on-one time. You should be able to have a \u201cboys night\u201d or \u201cSuperbowl Sunday Without The Spouses\u201d or fishing weekends or, hell, I dunno, have your own shopping trips and spa days - whatever y\u2019all did before the girlfriend came along, keep doing them sometimes without her.\nAnd encourage her to do the same with her friends. If she resists, this is a red flag. If she resists hard enough and long enough, but you still want to keep the relationship, you may need the help of a specialist.\nAnd, by \u201cspecialist\u201d, I mean a therapist who is especially trained in working with abusers. Not victims, not couples, *abusers*. Regular therapists are not trained in how to handle abusers, and regular therapy tends to make abusive relationships even worse because the tools that work when two people use them in good faith become weapons when abusers use them. Only an abuse specialist will be able to recognize if your relationship is abusive and have the tools to deal with it.\nIf someone trained in this field says that your relationship is not abusive, just codependent, they can tell you that they are not necessary for your problems and you can find a more appropriate therapist.\nRead Why Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men (book) by Lundy Bancroft. This book is written explicitly about male abusers and female victims, so there are some things that won\u2019t apply to your situation, but it\u2019s a good place to start, to look at some of the signs of abuse and how they\u2019re different from other forms of dysfunction in relationships. I\u2019m also told that Emotional Blackmail by Donna Frazier and Controlling People by Patricia Evans are good books, by people who I trust on the subject, although I haven\u2019t read either of them myself.\nRead the book and start by making some social dates without your spouse. Because this question is being asked in the middle of a pandemic, that might be challenging. But you can start hosting Netflix Parties with friends, or playing online games together, or starting up your own Discord chat, or just having an old-fashioned phone conversation (or less old-fashioned video chat) with a friend in a room in your house with the door closed and your girlfriend in another room.\nTell your girlfriend what you\u2019re doing - remember, these aren\u2019t *secrets* you\u2019re keeping - but insist on having your own private time with your friends. Explain it to her once, maybe twice, but don\u2019t keep arguing about it. This is not something you need permission for. You are an adult (I presume - this question was written anonymously), you don\u2019t have to ask anyone\u2019s permission to spend your own time however you want to.\nSo don\u2019t argue about it. State it simply, clearly, and kindly, and then drop the subject after you have explained. If she tries to argue with you about it, especially if she argues multiple times, or each time you try to exert your independence, don\u2019t hold space for her arguing.\n\u201cWe have discussed this and I have explained what\u2019s going on. I am not keeping secrets, I am nurturing my friendships. I am also not going to keep having this conversation. If you try to keep arguing about it, I am simply going to leave the room.\u201d\nIf she keeps arguing, if she picks difficult times to discuss like when you\u2019re trying to get ready for work or she keeps you up late at night so that you miss sleep, if she threatens you with physical harm, with damaged possessions, with locking you out, with any punitive action, if she withholds sex when you go out without her or she offers sex to keep you at home, if she is passive-aggressive, if she goes behind your back to contact your friends about the \u201cproblem\u201d - all of these kinds of behaviours are extremely concerning and point towards abuse.\nHealthy romantic relationships strike a balance between the amount of time people spend with each other and the amount of time they spend on their own things, including work, family, friends, hobbies, etc. Healthy romantic relationships also leave room for productive discussion over conflicts. If you are missing either of these two elements, then start insisting on them in your relationship, and if that escalates the problem, then you probably could use professional assistance.", "it is kinda the point ..You become a team .", "This can happen especially in younger relationships, give it time, it sounds like living together for you both is fairly new, the novelty will wear off at some stage..\nIf you're feeling suffocated it would probably be best if you sat your partner down & talked to her about what your needs are in the relationship, that you need a certain amount of space to be the best you can be, this also allows you to bring fresh & interesting ideas, information etc to the table..\nThe thing is that the whole deal with spending too much time together is just as bad as spending too much time apart..\nRemember, that each couple needs to determine what they both want or need from their time spent together & their relationship.\nThis should all be about negotiation so you both feel your being heard & will be one of many things as a couple you'll have to work through as you continue to map out your journey as a couple into the future..", "Is it normal in heterosexual relationships and heteronormative relationships? sadly, yes - which is why there are so many unhappy relationships and divorces.", "Yes it is hold on to it although it seem irritating now u be in an even worse spot wen it's gone.", "Only in prison!"], "topic_list": ["Girlfriend Advice", "Relationships", "Girlfriends", "Friendship", "Relationship Advice", "Philosophy of Everyday Life", "Dating Advice", "Dating and Relationships", "Interpersonal Interaction", "Life Advice"], "create_time": "Apr 8, 2020", "question_author": "Anonymous", "view_list": [128, 1200, 3, 42, 12, 6, 5], "upvote_list": [1, 40, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], "name_list": ["Georgia Peach", "Joreth Innkeeper", "Karen Davis", "Lesley Graham", "Scott McIntosh", "Rey Dubb", "William Mitchell"]}, "165": {"no_of_view": "970", "date_list": ["Apr 11, 2020", "Apr 10, 2020", "Apr 9, 2020", "Apr 9, 2020", "Apr 9, 2020"], "question_title": "Why won\u2019t my partner let me put her thongs on?", "no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 5, "ans_list": ["Most women aren't attracted to men wearing women's clothing.

What should I do?", "no_of_follower": 2, "respond_collected": 4, "ans_list": ["To elaborate further upon my situation at hand, I have been dating this boy for the past 6 months. He is 18 yrs and I am 17 yrs. I recognize that him and I take our relationship more seriously than most of other teenagers our age. Despite this, I am forever grateful for him and appreciate him for who he is. However, his mother is a helicopter parent which certainly makes things very difficult. For some more context, his parents have been long divorced and he lives with his mom a couple of blocks from me. I\u2019ve never really minded this, until recently that is.\nEssentially, his mom has accused him of many things involving him and I and constantly uses me as punishment for him. Mind you, he is 18 years old and will be going to college this fall, yet his mother cannot respect that. I\u2019ve noticed that she emotionally abuses him to no ends meet, using him as an emotional crutch and manipulating him into her control. She\u2019ll sometimes barge into his room and start crying her sorrows away to him, making him ridiculously uncomfortable. When he dismisses these actions to her, like an estranged wife, she\u2019ll run out of his room sometimes yelling, \u201cYou don\u2019t even care!\u201d This often happens when I am talking to him over the phone. Sometimes we\u2019ll be out together, fully to her knowledge and with little to no warning, she\u2019ll text him in full caps, \u201cCOME HOME NOW,\u201d usually before an hour has even passed. The only reason he complies to her absurd behavior is because he fears of upsetting her because he has to deal with it, which ends up happening anyways.\nBack in fall, she started crying in her car on the way to bringing him to school because she didn\u2019t want him to \u201cget me pregnant.\u201d This was barely even a month into our relationship and she still continues to cry over this, I have yet to even initiate any sexual activity with him. Besides that, one time she found my hair tie in his room and immediately started pounding on him that she will not take anything else for an answer and we clearly had sex in his bedroom despite this being FAR from the truth.\nDespite all this, my boyfriend makes a constant effort to spend time with me. His helicopter of a mom has morphed him into being deceitful towards her and rightfully so in my opinion, because apparently the truth seems worse than the lie somehow. Recently, his mom let him borrow her car to get to my house. 8pm rolls around and he was supposed to be home 30 minutes ago, funny how time passes by quickly with someone you have fun with. Anyways, he gets home and she starts SCREAMING bloody murder at him, claiming that this is the same torture his druggie of a sister put her through, which I highly doubt. To add on, she\u2019s condemning him to house arrest for the next month. It is currently mid-April and she fully intends on not letting him out of the house at all until the end of May. According to him, he\u2019s fully planning on finally telling her his rights as a legal adult. Although he won\u2019t bring anything she doesn\u2019t want in the house, he fully intends on letting her know that he will do as he please outside of the house. However, I\u2019m slowly doubting this\u2019ll happen as he keeps falling back on contentness. I fear he\u2019s enabling her behavior by not retaliating.\nI, by no means, wish ill will on their relationship, despite it being not a good one to begin with. But I seriously think something needs to be done sooner rather than lates. I don\u2019t think I can stand this any longer and it takes an emotional toll on me, having to weigh her consideration. Funny thing is that I\u2019ve probably only ever interacted with her 4 times throughout the past three years I\u2019ve known her, 3 of them being during the relationship.

Why? The reason is because being habituated to a stress response-the fight/flight/freeze response of that automatic brain- contributes greatly to our inability to access contentment and to be open and close with others and NeurOptimal works with that brainwave habit.\nLet me explain in greater detail. NeurOptimal neurofeedback software reads and is responsive in real time to the trainee\u2019s brainwaves. It gives feedback through auditory cues when it wants that automatic functioning brain to pay attention to what it\u2019s doing habitually.\nStress is a brain habit of assuming there is danger present when there is none. If there IS imminent danger then, yes, we want our brain to go on auto-pilot and punch, run or play dead to keep us alive. (That is the brain\u2019s definition of danger: occurring NOW and life-threatening.)\nWhen not perceiving present danger, the brain is supposed to be in a state of regulation: calm, able to focus, feel peaceful, playful, responsive to present in an accurate way, breathing normally, sleeping when tired.\nWe know stress as not sleeping well, worrying too much, having a hard time feeling joy and resistance to wanting to open up to others.\nIn my 9 years of working with people using NeurOptimal there are two factors that contribute the most to success shifting out of stress.\nReadiness to be a different person. Wanting to change; being ready for change. People who walk into my office for neurofeedback and say, \u201cI\u2019m ready to be less worried.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m tired of being alone.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m ready to feel joy again.\u201d My guess as to why that is an important factor is because their thoughts won\u2019t work against the reset will organically unfold as the brain sees its habits. As they calm down and cheer up, the mind response will be, \u201cyes!\u201d rather than, \u201cIs this OK, my worry is my safety net. I can\u2019t let that go.\u201d\nSeeing optimization or a positive reset of themselves as a holistic endeavor rather than a \u201cone-pill-wonder\u201d approach. To reset out of our habitual patterns and help our brains rewire, and our mood improve, we need to employ many tools, not just one. In doing so, we create the overall environment supportive for health and well-being. Here are three key ones to have alongside neurofeedback training:\nEnough sleep. Stress also impacts quality of sleep so just starting your NeurOptimal with a good sleep hygiene routine is a good start. Give yourself 3 months to reset your sleep with the goal of 7\u20138 hours a night. The brain eliminates toxins at night while we sleep. Here\u2019s a more in-depth blog and free sleep hygiene e-book I created.\nExercise. So important for helping the body and brain reset. 3\u20135 times a week, start with what\u2019s doable and work up to it.\nEating a brain foods rich diet. Your brain needs the building blocks to improve itself.

Sometimes people get together with people with the wrong reasons but eventually fall in love with that person.\nI know sounds very messed up but its even more messed up in my head because I am dealing with alot lately and I cant put a finger on what its like to be loved. I've questioned so many people. So many things its insane. So many memories that felt like this dream only till this realization.\nLove is hard to find.\nLots of love,\nR.S", "Most times if the person really loves you, he or she will be there for through thick and thin no matter the circumstances", "Don\u2019t listen what they say, don\u2019t read what they text you - watch what they are doing\u2026", "\u201cLove all, trust a few, do wrong to none.\u201d \u2014 William Shakespeare\nIf you\u2019re looking to understand the emotions of your partner, you\u2019re in the right place. Below are some useful tips for recognizing your lover\u2019s level of affection in a relationship.\nHere we go.\nThey Love To Make You Feel Optimistic\nThe skill to boost your partner\u2019s self-esteem during a relationship is critical. After all, during any times of significant adversity or sadness, it\u2019s good to know that you have someone who will always attempt to make you feel better.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean they should suck up to you and agree with everything you say. However, if they can voluntarily be a shoulder to cry on or someone you feel confident talking to during tough times, they likely care about you and the relationship which you both have.\nThey Show Respect For Your Opinions\nIt\u2019s normal to get into arguments and disagreements throughout a relationship. However, a crucial element of your connection should be the respect you have for each other.\nMaybe you\u2019re on opposite sides of the political spectrum, or perhaps you both differ in music taste. Whatever the case, it\u2019s essential to respect each other\u2019s personality and the views in which your partner holds.\nThey Make Eye Contact When Having A Conversation\nThis one is pretty well known. If they are making consistent eye contact throughout the conversation, it tends to suggest that they enjoy spending time with you, and remain emotionally invested in the discussion.\nIn contrast, those who may be on their phones while talking, or continuously looking away may have their mind pre-occupied with something else.\nThey Want To Be Affectionate\nSome people are nervous about showing public displays of affection (and that\u2019s okay). However, when you are spending time alone with each other, their body language can tell a lot about their emotions towards you.\nQuoting an article written by Jeremy Nicholson Ph.D. in Psychology Today, positive body language can include \u201cleaning in towards you, feet pointing towards you and wiggling happily, legs uncrossed and comfortable, arms open and palms up, playfully fondling jewelry or hair, smiling, extended eye contact, or looking down shyly.\u201d\nIf your partner is frequently displaying any of the above body languages, it\u2019s an optimistic sign that they genuinely care about you.\nThey Passionately Discuss Memories\nThe majority of couples around the world tend to enjoy speaking fondly of memories such as a vacation or day trip. If they love talking about past times, it tends to psychologically imply that you are regularly on their mind, and play a crucial role in their level of happiness\nif you enjoyed reading check more here : 5 psychological signs of being in love", "He\u2019s More Distant Than Usual\nIt might seem strange that a guy would pull away from you, but if he is confused about his feelings or he doesn\u2019t understand what is happening in his heart, you might find him being more distant than usual.\nMany women say they thought their guy was about to break up with them when he popped the question!\nHe is Making Plans for Your Future\nIf he lets it slip that you\u2019ll travel or buy a home or do anything together after next week, there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019s into you and is already in love.\nGuys don\u2019t make a lot of plans for the future that they say out loud, so if your man is all about what is happening next week, next month, next year \u2013 there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019s going to be yours forever.\nHe Won\u2019t Forget the Little Things\nHe\u2019ll remember when you have an appointment or need to be somewhere for a family function.\nHe won\u2019t bail on responsibilities and he\u2019ll always remember when you got together, even if you don\u2019t.\nHe\u2019ll ask about your parents and your friends and he\u2019ll ask how work is going, and remember to ask about that weiner, Susan, in accounting that you hate just so you have a chance to complain about her.\nHe Wants to be Close to You\nHe\u2019ll make an effort to be physically close to you as much as possible.\nIf you are out for dinner, you\u2019ll find him sitting on the same side of the table as you; he\u2019ll stand near you at a party; he\u2019ll want to be closer to you in the car.It\u2019s all his way of saying he loves you without actually saying, you know, he loves you.\nif you wanna read more signs check here :\n5 psychological signs of being in love", "You can\u2019t \u201ctell.\u201d You have to ask them to know what they are thinking.

Though we are both millennials, Chinese ones differ largely from American ones. We had completely different background with different concept of life in most areas.\nI often wondered what would have been if we didn't meet in the beginning or if we went separate ways. In a word, I thought I was settling. My husband has always been the one holding onto me all along for a long time; he never wanted to let me go, no matter how mad he was with me.

Obamacare, aka the Affordable Care Act, was repealed that year. Healthcare is now around 25% of our nation\u2019s GDP but we are back down to about 80% of people covered effectively because Medicaid was gutted too.

The LDR is just form of relationship all I want to say your love for each other should not fade-away in this time period as we can keep each other upto date with our day to day routines and life.\nIn my opinion it\u2019s time for testing your love that how much you guys do from each other.

I\u2019ll share my post with you here:\nSex and Intimacy in the Time of the Coronavirus\nThe coronavirus is taking its toll on all of us. Many of us are isolated from those we love and care about because of health concerns. Those of us who are polyamorous may feel even more isolated, since we are probably limited to what partners we can interact with. Us solo poly folks and those who are just dating may not have access to anyone for intimacy or sex. Self-care is important and making sure that not only our physical, but our mental and emotional health are taken care of can be daunting. Add to that, the desire to make sure our partner(s) are taken care of and we may become overwhelmed. What do we do? How can we have healthy sex and intimacy in a time of social distancing?\nNow I realize that much of what I\u2019m going to talk about requires funds and we don\u2019t all have access to do what it takes to do all of it. However, if you\u2019re reading this, you do have internet access and while physical sex and intimacy may be unattainable, social media has made it possible for us to interact in sexy and intimate ways. Self-distancing doesn\u2019t mean zero contact, it just means zero physical contact. Get creative! Find ways to connect with those you desire by other means than in person.\nMost of us are familiar with the five love languages, words of affirmation, time, gifts, acts of service and physical touch. I suggest we start with these. Identify what your love language is (it could be a combination of several. For me it\u2019s time and touch) and what are your partner(s) love languages. Then find ways to fulfill those needs without physical contact (yes, touch is the hard one). For those of use who are isolated, letting our partners know what we need is imperative. What follows are a few ideas on how to get through all this. Share the ones that resonate with you with those who love and care about you. If you aren\u2019t sure what resonates with them, ask. Request that they participate with you in creating a long-distance intimate and sexual connection.\nWords of Affirmation: This is pretty easy. Taking the time to send texts and messages telling your loved ones how important they are to you is a given. You can also go old school and send them a letter or card detailing your desire and love for them. Use programs like Marco Polo to send videos of you speaking to each other. If they enjoy dirty and or sexy talk, make a recording talking to them that they can play during masturbation.\nTime: This means quality time. Find things you can do via social media and other platforms. Playing games, watching movies, watching porn and spending time together, even if it\u2019s online can be enriching and fulfilling. Have meals together, via Skype or Zoom. Set the time and dates and stick to them.\nGifts: While it may seem difficult to give gifts while being distance, remember, Amazon (and others) still deliver. Send cards, small gifts and things you know they\u2019ll love to them on a regular basis. They don\u2019t have to be expensive, just things that resonate with them.\nService: This is a little harder, since much of service is about being physically present. Many of the previously mentioned ideas can constitute service. Also, you can do something like order dinner and have it delivered to them. If you\u2019re not in total lock down you can bringing them dinner personally. And if you are in total lockdown you can make gift certificates of the things you\u2019ll do for them when this crisis is over.\nTouch: This is the hardest of all. And where you can be the most creative. Mutual masturbation, with verbal descriptions of where and how you are touching them. There are some sex toys that can be operated remotely. Buy each of you one and take turns controlling the toys. Send virtual hugs and strokes on a daily basis. This is one time where it may be appropriate to send explicit photos (with permission of course).\nAnd, don\u2019t forget to take care of yourself. Self-pleasure is more than jacking off. It\u2019s taking time for a long bath. It\u2019s being intimate with yourself, by watching a sexy movie, reading a book that turns you on or even meditating on sex and sensuality.\nThese are just a few ideas to keep the sex and intimacy alive while dealing with the pandemic. Sex and intimacy in the time of the coronavirus is possible, if you\u2019re willing to step outside of your preconceived ideas of what constitutes sex and intimacy.", "Frequent and sometimes chronic masturbation \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6", "What\u2019s the difference????\nYou were already long distance.\nNothing should be different because of isolation\nThe phone still works.\nVideo chat still works.\nEmail still works.\nJust because you\u2019re suddenly bored it shouldn\u2019t change the dynamics of a relationship.", "Well, I work 2 jobs.

Become the person that you want to be. Show your partner and encourage each other to become the best version of yourself. If you are keeping yourself busy with that - you will become much more attractive and your partner will want to know what you are up to. If you are constantly on your phone, nagging about that you didn\u2018t have a 4 hours phone call today and that you\u2018re bored? Well that indicates that you are a boring person. If you are calling with having something exciting to talk about - that\u2018s completely fine (and 4 hours phone calls are great, if they are stimulating) but don\u2018t expect your partner to entertain you at all times! There is more to do and learn than anyone could manage in a lifetime.\nTo my second point: In those times routine can be a lifesaver. Get up at the same time every day, and try to get enough sleep every night. Then set some fun traditions with your partner that you do every day at the same time. Some ideas might be: Watching a movie/TV series, reading the same book, playing an online game, cook the same thing and have a dinner date, learn a language or a skill together\u2026 whatever you both would enjoy.\nFor me it\u2018s short workout before lunch and watching series in the evening. :)", "In this period i am managing this well.

I seem to be genetically programmed to logical reasoning.\nBut I think I understand why at least some people I\u2019ve known, blamed the Other Person first: I think it was a combination of things.\nPerhaps, wanting to continue to believe in love as a magic force, for one. If a \u201cbad person\u201d snuck in and \u201cstole\u201d your mate, then maybe love itself isn\u2019t the problem.\nAnd then, there\u2019s avoiding personal responsibility, of course. If the third person was the culprit, then it wasn\u2019t the fault of the person who was cheated on.\nPart of it could be a sort of subtle superiority prejudice. What I\u2019m thinking of, is that if you are someone who thinks that you gained your mate originally by more or less seducing them (i.e. you think you CAUSED them to want you), then you might logically assume that the third person tricked or seduced them as well; this involves an unfortunate refusal to allow for the idea that your mate has their own mind and their own innate desires. But it does result also in blaming the new person for the cheating, not the mate.\nPart of it could be simple reactive anger, not much different from blaming the curb one trips over, instead of one\u2019s own failure to see clearly. There\u2019s no thinking involved with this, it\u2019s just a snap reaction to the pain.\nAnyway, although I do despise the people who my ex cheated with, since they did know they were with someone who was cheating, I never blamed them for my ex\u2019s decision to cheat. That was 100% her choice, her action. The people she cheated with, were just people who didn\u2019t fit in to my idea about how a person ought to conduct themselves.", "The truth is they should blame both of the cheaters, because both are responsible for deceiving the person being cheated on.

Because we each should make a commitment towards conducting ourselves with enough decorum that we don\u2019t look like disgusting deviants. We shouldn\u2019t aim to approach humanity with such a mean streak that we deliberately hurt another human being. That\u2019s a weak way to live. And it destroys families, human beings and society in general.\nThat\u2019s why cheaters say things like, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you,\u201d knowing they full well intended to hurt you if they defied your trust.\nOn top of that, both the cheater and the cheating interloper never refrain from blaming the innocent partner. In fact, usually, to add insult to injury, most interlopers try to become the hall monitor in the marriage which demonstrates the lack of decency they have.\nBesides that, they have no pride because most married men are looking to aggressively control their mistress and will choose a single woman so they can isolate her more easily from family and friends.

This is the major reason why a lot of people end up ghosting each other. Basically, it is their psychology and old wounds talking.\nPush Pull Technique Two:\nThis is basically a meditation practice in which you attract someone towards yourself through the power of your Chakras and aura (pull) and if there is someone you want to get rid of, you release your bonds with them and send their energies back at them (push).

That was for other people. Any relationships I had, allowed me to be free. Mutual respect and affection, mostly without exclusivity. These were wonderful relationships and I would never call them a waste of time.

You need to learn to see each man for his good qualities and not his shortcomings.\nThe most meaningful thing I learned in dating was that if you just date casually you learn to see each man at his best. You don't focus on if he'll make a good lifetime partner because you\u2019re just dating him for what he offers you right now.\nI dated one fellow who was just a fantastic date. He oozed the social graces. He was a pleasure to go out with. He held the door, he took care of me like a lady, he made great conversation. It was a pleasure to date him. I knew another guy that was superior in the sack. Honestly, I couldn't wait to get into bed with him he was just really good at sex. I dated another fellow that loved recreation. He had boats and motorcycles and airplanes and he just wanted someone to enjoy these things with. It was like dating Indiana Jones! The adventure was wonderful.\nNow, today, as a grown woman with husband and a family, I remember all the men I dated for their very best qualities. I remember the things I loved about them. I don\u2019t really think about them for their worst qualities because I wasn\u2019t looking for a husband. I didn\u2019t need the whole husband package so I wasn\u2019t critiquing them on their flaws.

I don\u2019t think about the commonalities right off the bat when I like someone. It\u2019s a bonus for sure if you can have something in common, but it shouldn\u2019t have to hinder anyone from pursuing a relationship. My wife and I for instance are almost an odd couple. She was a millenial and I was a gen X. That didn\u2019t really make any difference between us. I think I just don\u2019t expect anything much whether or not we have anything in common or not. We eventually adapted to our new life with one another and eventually you find some grounds where you can both share something together. My wife thinks for a long time that my friends are nerds and boring. That they don\u2019t know how to have fun. But eventually she learned to compare her old friends with mine and why my friends are genuinely good people and have more merit than her group of friends that come and go. She adapted to my life style and I did with her. I think as couples; as long as both parties are open minded about their new life together, they can find common grounds to share and make memories they thought they\u2019d never would have. You can also try to find something that the other person may enjoy that you enjoy. My wife didn\u2019t like to go hiking as much before, now we do it almost a lot. My wife likes to play poker, and casinos and I told her I don\u2019t like losing money in general and I don\u2019t like taking that kind of risks. She lost a lot of money proving me otherwise, but she had to learn the hard way. I introduced her to chess, and now we have more fun playing than she ever did playing cards at casinos.

This is basically a prerequisite for almost all relationships.", "People always have different taste.\nwhen you love someone you might found somethings in common but most of the things you may don,t like.But when you truly love someone we take the chances that we didn,t like before. To make that person happy you take those taste.For example a place you don,t wanted to go but your love once wants to go there. Somtimes different taste give you anger but sametime you feel happy when you see your love once when happy.\nSo really common that people loved each other without anything common.", "Hey,\nThis ia a very interesting question because to answer it I believe it's important to know what we understand as \u2018 having nothing in common\u2019. Currently I'm in a relationship which has made me ask this, and I've come to realize that what I was perceiving as differences were actually complements. Still, it all depends on the type of differences we are talking about.\nFor example, my partner loves to go outside and has a lot of friends and acquaintances. I, on the other hand, enjoy indoor activities more and don't really like hanging out with more than four people. This is something that could make us break up if we were to perceive it negatively, instead we have decided to take advantage of it.\nHow? By communicating effectively. The aforementioned requires those involved to know themselves, so they will be able to make agreements.\nNow, this is not to say that you should change yourself entirely just because you don't your relationship to end. No. Sometimes I don't feel like going out, so I don't.\nThere are differences with a stronger impact on our lives. For example, let's suppose that I don't want to have children, but my partner does. In this case, both of us would have to really think about the importance of said thing for us by asking the following:\nWill I be ok with this decision 5, 10 or 15 years from now?\nWill I, at some point, blame my partner?\nBeing different from your partner is not necessarily something bad. In fact, when appreciated and valued, differences can improve our relationships greatly. Still, we need to be able to consider those which could be problematic in the long run.\nBest of luck.", "I believe that's the beauty of real love. It may not make sense but it sure is wonderful. I like to look at it as their half and my half equals a whole. What they have what I'm lacking and I'm lacking what they have and it makes a great relationship!", "Two people who are opposite can make their relationship work. Each partner should be supportive of the other\u2019s interests and maybe even choose to venture in those interests so they can relate to their partner.\nFor example, if a guy likes sport but his girlfriend prefers music, the girl may support the guy when he plays his basketball games and offer to watch NBA games with the guy. On the other hand, the guy can offer to attend a music festival with the girl.\nThe differences between them can be used to their advantage, if they choose to do so. They can keep learning from each other through their different interests. Eventually, they\u2019ll find common ground.\nBut I always think that a relationship can survive even if two people don\u2019t have the same interests. But a relationship cannot survive if two people have different and opposing beliefs, values and moral systems.", "Honestly, I don\u2019t see that going very far. I once was with someone who liked doing drugs. She knew I hated it. For me it was an extreme turn off. She was never going to stop. Until one day, she showed me her true colors and that was enough for me to stop putting up with her period. You live and learn. If I were you, spend your energy on someone you are more compatible with.

It would depend how you feel about that person. Do the things they do drive you insane, if so then it will probably never work cause you'll spend the relationship nit picking the person to death or complaining about them to others so much to others that now outsiders have a negative opinion about them.\nIf the things they do get on your nerves but not to the point you want to off yourself or them then you'll have to find a way to deal with it if you want the relationship to work. If you do decide to make it work remember everyone is different and you can't change anyone so go in with an open mind and take it one day at a time.", "Everything will work, try your best to learn what she likes and if she follows she will probably do what you like.

But from love comes trust and honesty. From trust comes vunerability and openness. From honesty comes truth and values. When these things are out in the open, patience is learned to adapt to each other. And suddenly, instead of being 2 very different people in a relationship, we become 1 new and complete unit.", "This can be done in the workplace (a relationship with an employee, supervisor or colleague) where people typically police and modify their own behaviours carefully and there are workplace about behaviours and procedures. But it cannot be easily done in a romantic couple.\nIt has to be done out of necessity sometimes in biological families with sibling/parent clashes and in blended families between step-members.\nManaging conflict is a term you can search on the internet and you will discover strategies around communication, decision making and respect. But as soon as the relationship in question involves someone in a position of power (parent, step-parent or boss) and someone who lacks power (employee, non-biological child, biological child) then the conflict can be exacerbated. In this case, professional counselling is highly desirable.", "Hard to pull off but many have done it. First find what you do have in common and build from there.

Sometimes it can be quite positive, as each partner has the opportunity to step out of their comfort zones, and learn new and (potentially) better ways to look at life.\nTo do this successfully, it takes a willingness from both parties to adapt, and make some compromises that will make co-existing with each other a lot easier. It\u2019s best when this remains balanced, even though it doesn\u2019t have to be equal all the time.\nUnfortunately, there are some differences that are harder to overcome; like if one person wants children, or if two people have completely different views of what they want their lives to look like.

The second includes praise, complements, encouragement, as well as self-disclosure of feelings, victories, failings, hopes, and fears; and toleration and understanding of the feelings, frailties, and failures of the other. The third includes nurturing, care-giving, emotional support, sustenance, advocacy, and guidance; while providing protection, defense, sheltering, healing, and spiritual support. Empirical inquiry indicated that infatuation wears off in four years or less, successful relationships generally include demographic similarities, being comfortable together, mutual thoughts, goals, and interests; lacking those elements; divorce is likely, particularly if there is criticism of personality, arrogant contempt, defensiveness; and stonewalling/emotional withdrawal. Factors indicative of a good relationship: Childlessness; close friendship; resolve differences at the beginning; cared for person coupled with a caretaker; housework division; attractive females and lesser attractive males; overlapping social relationships; compatible spending habits; weekly sex; and, celebration of the partner\u2019s achievements.\nSelf-awareness can allow one to recognize subconscious response to stimulus, perhaps only after the fact in the beginning, but continued effort can lead to self-control and altered behavior; discussed here:\nWhy am I contradicting myself like a hypocrite?", "Girl shut the fuck up I was already working on controlling my angry and being alil more humble anything else I can give a flying fuck to change for him if he requires more because hebeen fucking yo low down dirty shame ass bitch I was already planning on losing weight and I'll be way more fine Than your fake tits skinny ass but that was for self not him Bitch ion want to be you you evil your spirit is way more Jacked up then mines I've opened my home which ain't never been much and relationship up to you several of times despite my bad angry and being sensitive and you always him to acted like eeehhh no but you went and started sleeping with him behind my back now you think I'm suppose to move around foryou BITCH BITCH once again how I'll kill you bitch and we fighting ion care about anything after bitch you got me fucked up Ashley skank ass hoe how and when I see you like older girl say on Friday I'mma beat ha asss!!!!", "Watch this, works for any gender", "one you agree with the other is a imposed belief - you must decide which is which"], "topic_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 2, 2020", "question_author": "Sarah Nguyen", "view_list": [33, 40, 53, 34, 6, 5, 43, 60, 36, 3, 5], "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], "name_list": ["James Hu", "Peter Charlot", "Muhammad Asim", "Jay Phillip", "Nenad Tashkovski", "Hulkup Delisle", "Dave McEwen", "Dan Robb", "Lisa Wilcox", "Sophia St", "Jason D Kilsch"]}, "1104": {"no_of_view": 0, "date_list": [], "question_title": "error", "no_of_follower": 0, "respond_collected": 0, "ans_list": [], "topic_list": [], "create_time": "", "question_author": "", "view_list": [], "upvote_list": [], "name_list": []}, "279": {"no_of_view": "74", "date_list": ["Mar 28, 2020"], "question_title": "Is that true teens are not so active on Quora nowadays because parents are at home due to covid -19 lockdown?", "no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 1, "ans_list": ["It is hard to generalize but it is possible that a lot of teens are connecting with their families and so they are staying off social media."], "topic_list": [], "create_time": "Mar 27, 2020", "question_author": "Sambhav", "view_list": [22], "upvote_list": [1], "name_list": ["Deep Sankalp"]}, "490": {"no_of_view": "977", "date_list": ["Apr 17, 2020"], "question_title": "What is the best way to explain your relationship with your boyfriend?", "no_of_follower": 2, "respond_collected": 1, "ans_list": ["I give him sex, he buys me things."], "topic_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 16, 2020", "question_author": "Kathy R.

He let everyone know how he felt about me to the whole class. I never knew how he felt about me till that day. He thought I was funny looking and was doing me a favor by being my boyfriend. My classmates felt so sorry for me. Yet I forgave him. However, I started to stop wearing nice clothes and getting a dolled up. I would wear clothes that had holes and stopped acting lady like. Once I went to dinner with him in my pajamas and old slippers. Played with my food and burping the whole time. About 6 months later, I kicked him in his balls and told him how it felt what he did to me while he was on the ground in pain. Good thing I was never in love with him.\nMy second boyfriend was actually my first love, and it took me 9 months to fall in love with him. After what my first boyfriend did to me, I wasn\u2019t easily trusting to any guy and was too cautious. He had to work really hard to win my heart. Once my second boyfriend won my heart, I married him and wanted a good life with him. It took me a long time to see why it wasn\u2019t a good idea to fall in love. I did everything for him, even giving up my dreams. I was under his control. I was too afraid to look at any guy and always looking at the ground because he would asked me what I was looking at and if I had the hot for that guy. I got threatened with divorce whenever I tried to stand up to him. I wasn\u2019t even allowed to defend myself when his family belittled me. To his family, I was never good enough.

I wanted to get my degree and work for Microsoft. He was so insanely jealous and didn\u2019t want me to leave him for another man that would be better than him. All I wanted was to give us a better life. Anything I tried to do, he would use divorce to stop me. This time, the desire to break free from him was a lot stronger, and I was willing to follow my dreams, even by letting him go. He served me the divorce papers after I refused to give in. I didn\u2019t believe he would do it and was really hurt by it. But I knew that I could no longer keep on being with him. I didn\u2019t want to be under his control anymore and always unhappy.

I am not a professional therapist so I will try to explain it in layman terms.\nIt happens when you meet a person and immediately form a very favorable opinion of that person. Once your mind has formed this opinion it has difficulty accepting any information that contradicts the initial positive opinion.\nCognitive dissonance is another way to describe this phenomenon. It is when a person believes certain things to be true, and when they have evidence to the contrary they can't accept the alternate facts and will basically lie to themselves in order to be able to accept the new information. For example, in my relationship with my ex; I had always said that if a man ever cheated on me I would leave and never look back. When I discovered he had a personal ad on a popular dating site I didn't want to face the truth and felt torn morally, it went against everything I ever felt to be \u201cright\u201d. I convinced myself (with his help) that it wasn't really cheating, he hadn't actually gone on a date with anyone else. It was \u201cinnocent\u201d flirtation and didn't mean anything.\nOr when he strangled me, it wasn't physical abuse because it only happened once and it wasn't \u201chitting\u201d me. I even said to him it was very close to being abusive and he laughed at me and said he \u201cjust had his hands on my throat\u201d.\nThe narcissist (which is what you were involved with) seems to instinctively know it's human nature for people to form these positive beliefs early in the relationship and have difficulty getting their mind to change that opinion. They lay on the charm heavy in the beginning, they pretend to be the perfect soul mate. They sweep their target off their feet, have the same interests, are exactly, what the target always wanted, even more than the target ever thought they wanted.\nThe abuse starts \u201cout of the blue\" and is SO \u201cout of character\u201d the victim struggles with the shock and accepting this harsh contrast to the man they fell in love with. It might be easier to accept if the change of behavior was consistent, but it isn't. The narcissist will go back to his sweet loving self as if a switch went off. The victim excuses the bizarre behavior by chalking it up to the N having a bad day, or finds some other plausible excuse. Over time the abusive behavior gets more frequent and the honeymoon period is shorter. The abuse becomes unbearable and constant (even during the worst times of abuse the narcissist will still out of the blue do something totally unselfish and sweet). Whereas before the sweet and loving treatment by the narcissist was the norm interspersed with bouts of abuse; now the usual treatment is abusive with occasional loving gestures. The victim is so used to be treated poorly that the smallest insignificant nicety is exaggerated in the victim\u2019s mind. Something as simple as complimenting the victim or buying them a chocolate bar will be enough to give the victim hope that the sweet man they met is still deep inside and if they can prove their love or explain how they feel in a way the narcissist will understand; all will be well again.\nPeople often think they can't help obsessing about something. \u201cMy mind just goes there, I can't stop thinking about him/it.\u201d But the truth of the matter is; our brains only know the information we put in there. We control what we think about. The problem is, the mind builds pathways that get deeper the more we think about something. So over time our mind will automatically go to certain thoughts.\nThink about when you start a new job, you have to take notes to remember what to do, or when you are learning to drive, nothing comes automatically, but it doesn't take long before you do things without even thinking about it. It comes naturally.\nAs it is with the narcissist, thoughts of him, those pathways to the brain are so deeply imbedded, you don't have to consciously make yourself think about him, it's automatic.\nIn order to stop thinking about him in all his glory, you have to consciously make yourself think of something else. It might help to take up a new hobby, do charity work, if you know intellectually that you are making excuses for bad behavior, you have to force yourself to acknowledge what you are doing and correct your thinking. Eventually it will stick. But it will take time. Be patient with yourself. You have, for all intent and purposes been brainwashed and are suffering in much the same way POW's do.\nIt is imperative that you remain no contact because those pathways are so deep that any contact with him will take you right back to doubting yourself and questioning if you imagined the abuse. It can be years later, and the narcissist will pop back into the victims life. The victim thinks they are healed and can handle seeing him but it's like riding a bike; you never forget and can easily fall prey again.", "Because you are a victim.\nFinding a therapist or support group can help you transition from victim to survivor.", "You have unfortunately been conditioned to do this.

This then conditions you to fill in the blanks for them, you basically can't comprehend that someone would do those things to you, because you are not abusive yourself.

Most of the time its barking is annoying, at best.", "I don\u2019t know what sense of \u201cargument\u201d you are talking about. The topics chosen to qualify the question are quite broad.\nIn logic, an argument is a function, it doesn\u2019t serve a function. Anyone who does any basic program will easily understand this. You will give your program a number of cases, and when those cases are satisfied, you will tell it to do such and such. That is a function in the form of a logical argument. In logic, we define a valid argument very precisely as a structure whereby, if the premises are true, the conclusion cannot be false. This is not the same meaning as when you might use the term \u201cargument\u201d in other contexts.\nIn debate, \u201cargument\u201d might be ambiguous between a disagreement or the different positions taken by the debaters, or it could refer to the logical definition of \u201cargument\u201d as in specific arguments given for their positions which can be analyzed for their validity and soundness. I suppose in this sense the point, or function, of either sense of argument is an attempt to get closer to the truth, or at least better clarify positions on a topic.\nIn the most common sense, let\u2019s call it the domestic sense, \u201cargument\u201d could refer to any verbal fight, dispute, or disagreement between two or more people. In this sense, I always recall that two headed creature from the children\u2019s program Sesame Street. The one head only says \u201cYup yup yup yup..\u201d, and the other responds, \u201cnope nope nope nope nope nope.\u201d And it goes on and on like that. That kind of argument is obviously unproductive. But what makes it such?\nIn the first logical case where the argument is the function, it is doing something for us, namely whatever we have constructed it to do. It produces some desired result. In the debate sense, the desired result is a little more abstract. We have to refer to very general things like \u201cgetting closer to the truth\u201d or \u201cclarifying our positions\u201d. The debate serves its function in as much as we feel it has achieved these more general abstract purposes. I may have underplayed a purpose in the domestic sense, or lessened it by poking some fun at it.\nIn reality, common domestic disputes may have the same general purposes as a debate. But that really depends on the persons involved, and what they want to get out of it, and whether they want to get the same thing from it. If the one person has the sole purpose of clarifying contrary positions on a topic, and the other genuinely wants to get closer to the truth, the first person is going to really annoy and frustrate the second. It\u2019s going to appear that they are merely playing devil\u2019s advocate, and not genuinely attempting to find a common resolution. Just as in a piece of code, or even in a formal debate, those arguing in a domestic dispute ought to first decide their purpose, and agree on a desired outcome. Obviously that is very difficult to do in the course of life since these disagreements can seemingly erupt almost spontaneously out of raw emotions and not decidedly well formed logical propositions. But as soon as one feels like the argument is going nowhere, that it is become just like that two headed \u201cyes-no\u201d Sesame Street monster, it\u2019s probably time to take a step back and start considering the purpose. Then when emotions have cooled, discussing the desired outcome with one another to see if you can at least get on the same page on that. If not, the argument will serve no function, even when it is in a perfectly valid logical form.", "If you are a goat n the listener is a Woolf, arguments won't, if you are a jaguar and listener is a woolf you need not to argue.your power has already functioned.might is right", "Yes. They sort out disputes", "Yes and no.

We'd have murder, rape and violence and, even though we'd still react violently to being the victim of a crime, we'd never argue against the perpetrator and they'd never face the punishment.\nArguments are one of the most important things humanity has. Of course, like many good things, they can be taken too far and lead exactly to the thing we were arguing against in the first place: an argument about war leads to war and an argument about rape leads to rape because they are coerced into trying to prove eachother wrong and it becomes more violent and boom! We have a war.\nOne could argue that arguing is the source fo humanity. Arguments can be observed by an outsider, and they teach each other about the opposite point and maybe people become convinced of a much more positive point. Of course the downside can be leading to a negative point, but then that encourages more learning and these things don't happen again.\nArgument is great.

That way you can see for yourself.\nNow please be aware that this is stuff I\u2019ve had to learn the hard way. When I returned from Iraq, I developed complex PTSD and chronic anxiety; suffice to say I was extremely angry and on Boxing Day last year, my partner had had enough and told me to leave the family home. I basically had to move out the day after Xmas. The love of my life was scared of me and my little one didn\u2019t want to come near me. So you can have an idea of what that did to me. My family wanted nothing to do with me. I wasn\u2019t violent, but I wasn\u2019t a nice character and was highly aggressive in a scenario that no longer required it. So I went through the normal shit of blaming her and being more angry at everyone around me, until I said to myself, \u201cthe only way I\u2019m gonna get them back is to prove to them that I can change\u201d, but I had to do this for myself and with no guarantee that they\u2019d want me back. Cut a long story short, I went through extreme mental turmoil, the likes of which I\u2019ve never gone through. I then picked myself up and got in touch healthy minds, then combat stress and finally PTSD resolution. I then received counselling from RELATE, which is a British relationship counselling service. I also studied civilian relationships and what made them a success and what made people fail. So I\u2019d come home from work every night and I\u2019d listen to audio self help books, I\u2019d watch YouTube vids on relationships and I used to research on google and read books until bed. I did this whilst fighting with extreme anxiety attacks on a daily basis, where shit got smashed up. Better that than people huh? Anyway, I worked solidly for 31 days and then asked my ex out on a date and unbeknown to me, she\u2019d been keeping an eye on my progress. Now remember, by this time, I thought that was it. I thought I was dumped and there way no going back, so you can imagine my amazement when she agreed to the date. And the following are ways in which I got her back and is what a NON toxic relationship looks like. Tried and tested. I can\u2019t however, give explanations for each one as I\u2019d be here all day lol.\n1. Remain indifferent and don\u2019t let anyone knock you off your perch. Indifferent means that you\u2019re in a good place whatever happens, so you\u2019re happy if you have her and happy if you don\u2019t.\n2. Cut out all neediness and insecurity. Everyone feels this, just don\u2019t let your partner know about them. It\u2019s unattractive and massively easier said than done, but it\u2019s a must and you can win anyone over if you get this down. For instance, if she does something you don\u2019t like, like she fucks off in the middle of a text conversation and ignores your replies, DO NOT lose your shit! Ignore it coz it\u2019ll be done to test you and to see how you react. Women subconsciously test like mad and if you fail these tests, you\u2019ll get dumped. They\u2019ll do stuff like come on hot all week and text you every day and then suddenly you won\u2019t hear from her for a couple of days. DO NOT respond to this and certainly don\u2019t send any texts asking what\u2019s wrong! It\u2019s a test again. Just leave it until you hear from her and DO NOT act angrily! Respond as if nothing has happened.\n3. All the minor things like in No. 2, let them go! Obviously stand your ground in a calm and understanding way if it\u2019s bad, but don\u2019t ever lose your shit. Don\u2019t give them anything to fight against.\n4. Happy wife happy life. Whether they\u2019re right or wrong, they\u2019re always right! Got it? Lol Hard to stomach I know, just be there when it goes wrong and do not rub it in their face.\n5. MOST IMPORTANT ONE: The 3 \u2018H\u2019s. Hang out, Have fun, Hook up. Stick to this and make sure every time you see your girl you make sure they\u2019re having fun, then the rest will follow.\n6. When she\u2019s talking, you shut the fk up and listen. Make sure you ask questions about what she said earlier in the convo, so they know that you\u2019re listening. And ask if she wants you to listen or give advice and make sure you pay attention to that!\n7. Actions speak louder than words. Words mean nothing to a woman. Show her you Iove her and appreciate her. Two different things that require different methods of action. But don\u2019t do these things all the time. Only do them sporadically and make them a surprise.\n8. Do not smother them. When they pull back, you pull back but be easy going about it and DO NOT get offended.\n9. Don\u2019t get indifference mixed up with being ignorant and basically being a jerk to women coz that\u2019ll cause the opposite effect.\n10. DO NOT argue! If an argument happens and it will, walk away and return when you\u2019ve cooled down and talk about it constructively. Tell her you understand and appreciate where she\u2019s coming from and why and calmly try and explain why you felt the way you did, but add in that you yourself could be wrong. You MUST do this whether you believe it or not! Lol If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be labelled a control freak, rightly or wrongly lol. It\u2019s all about conflict management.

Every couple has , unique requirements of space . There are couples who can co exist peacefully without arguments & then there are couples who engage in argumentative conflict . But space requirements vastly vary . By space , I mean physical distance for some hours of a day & head space .\nIf one looks at physical distance , it is one of the healthiest , and best ways of avoiding conflict .

But there are little tricks to avoid arguments . I\u2019m listing them in brief points .\nRoutine - A lockdown offers people the \u201c work from home \u201c which reduces travel time . However it\u2019s very important to get good sleep , wake up at a fixed time , like one is used to whilst working from one\u2019s workplace . Sleep and routine are extremely effective to combat stress , even so in the abscence of calming techniques like yoga , meditation, movies , music or reading. Get enough sleep , do not make the mistake of having no routine . This shall put you in your worst moods . Draw up a routine\nWork in separate rooms if possible . If you live in a studio , find different corners .\nCommunicate only as much as you would during a normal work day . Remember you and your partner are working from home .\n4. Step outside your apartment , walk down the flight of stairs and walk around your building / house . Do not break the law , do not violate rules , maintain social distancing and safe practices . But walking around your building / house within the confines of the gate , sitting under a tree or sitting on the roof ( if your apartment / house ) has one , is a good way to get a change of scene .\n5. Talk to friends - Talk - DONT chat . Dial the numbers , talk about things other than Covid 19 . This is refreshing . Do not talk only about the pandemic - you are reading the pandemic , living the pandemic . You need to give your mind rest . Talk about good things . This helps .\n6. Share home responsibilities - but do not Get in each other\u2019s way\n7. always have good topics lined up to talk about ; list some every day - movies , travel , places , food .\n8. Talk and listen - do not discuss\n9. Do not use time together to settle scores , bring up old arguments . Use this time to create moments of happiness ( joke , tell stories , and say things which are light hearted )\n10. Don\u2019t take yourself seriously , don\u2019t take your partner seriously / know that being shut out from the world is affecting you and of course them too . So whenever you feel , that you aren\u2019t at your best and they aren\u2019t at their best , know that this shall pass . The trick is to just not keep talking about the pandemic and how terrible things are . The trick is to just live each day , stay safe and be cool & avoid worrying about the future\n11 . Cuddle some , play some and have great sex. Cuddling , affection and sex are healthy . They release dopamine & oxytocin. Good sex , lowers cortisol , stress , blood pressure , helps to balance hormonal levels , brings people even closer . Without sex , human beings cannot be at their best .

It attacks and ruthlessly kills human beings of all types and all walks of life: young and old, all races and all ethnicity, all religions and spiritual affiliations, all genders and all social and economic status.\nAs a spiritual counselor, I believe that the following will transpire:\nWe will begin to take our relationships and our connections we have with people in general - especially with our loved ones - much more seriously. We won\u2019t take for granted our connections any longer. We will treat, behave and speak to our connections as though we are no longer promised another tomorrow.\nWe will live our lives more mindfully. We will learn to fully embrace our feelings in general. We will experience joy and pleasure with new eyes. We will experience loss and grief with new eyes. We will taste our food completely. We will feel each sensation and emotion and we will savor.\nThis disease may very well lead the masses to a new mindset regarding tolerance. We live in an extremely diverse yet very intolerant world. Yet when one cannot breathe, we are all alike. We are all the same. We are all human beings. We may become more empathetic as a society.\nWe will learn to appreciate our senses. Touch, taste, smell, sight and hearing. Each experience we have will have meaning and won\u2019t be taken for granted.\nWe will learn to connect with G-d in a deeper, more meaningful way. We will, as a society, come to realize that each day and each experience we have - however briefly - is actually a gift. We will learn simple gratitude.\nWe as a society will realize that the \u201calmighty dollar\u201d isn\u2019t important. Not really. Not when you cannot breathe. As a result, we will learn to share and to give. To treat others as we\u2019d hope to be treated.\nFor example, I found a list of some 300 EPA approved COVID-19 cleaning products. Most are NOT Clorox or Lysol, although they\u2019re on the list too. Some are very much still available at regular prices. I searched the list and we actually had some of those products already in the house. I think most people probably will so there\u2019s no reason to pay crazy prices for Lysol. (I would link it here but there\u2019s a rule about adding links so if you just do a basic internet search for the list, you\u2019ll find it, it\u2019s very easy to find.) It\u2019s a public service list or something. Anyway, but I see eBay listings for ONE can of Lysol for $45,000! People believe that\u2019s the only way they will live. How cruel and sad is that? I have cleaning products and know where to buy them but why should I be the only one who lives? What\u2019s that passage about the meek? That\u2019s why I posted the list instead of buying up all the products then trying to sell them. It\u2019s my take that people will realize that it\u2019s WRONG to try to profit from a pandemic and the pain that others experience and PEOPLE WILL DEVELOP EMPATHY.\nI believe this world will develop empathy as a result of this pandemic. Because as I said before, if you owned something that would save a life would you not share it? Hopefully, you would! That is why I share. I definitely don\u2019t want to end up going to judgement and G-d saying, \u201chope that $45,000 was worth your soul.\u201d Just saying. I think people will learn to treat others with respect. Dignity. And unconditional love and with empathy from this point forward.\nBlessings xo", "I hope that many of us will become less selfish after learning how to distance ourselves from other people for so long \ud83d\ude0a.\nDuring this crisis we\u2019ve seen how people get panicked & try to save themselves by emptying whatever stocked shelves in stores, or disregarding others by not staying at home to stop the virus from spreading.\nPerhaps that\u2019s just how human react in general when get triggered by something bigger than ourselves. Some immediately feel the fear, some underestimate its power (perhaps thinking human & their technology is invincible - who knows).\nI think in the end we will learn that we are here to also help nurture the nature & each other, just as the nature nurture all the livings on Earth for the benefit of all.", "I believe that it goes both ways. Depending on the people it can strengthen or weaken relationships.\nSome people are taking this self-quarantine time to be more productive in their life which includes relationships.

But I usually have so much stuff going on so I can\u2019t stay committed and end up only doing it every other week. But now I\u2019m doing workouts every morning and night. I think this will transfer over to different situations.

And most times, precious.", "i was compared too with my neighbour.\nour son was abt 6 months old. and we had not officially moved in together. she was staying pretty far from me and she wanted to stay closer to me a few kilometres apart. it was a good gesture and made a lot of sense but it changed everything.\nabout six years back before my son was born, i was in high school and the was a classmate of mine Michael. he had only one friend, everyone else did not like him. they said he was a back stabber selfish arrogant lier and just self centered. i could not judge him but those statements came from reliable sources.\nwe ended up goin to the same college studying accounting together and we tried to make our friendship work. he was more industrious than me. he took risks. he was not scared to get into bebt and was not scared to try anything. it seemed to pay off for him, he got financially independent way faster than me and seemed to have himself established. our friendship did not work out, we just could not hit it off. he was too quick for me.\nanyway life seemed to force us to always meet. the mother of my child was very beautiful, she was dead gorgeous, i remember when my cousin first met her he said no ways u approached this girl and asked her out, and that was true. i did not approach, and would have never dared too, she did. she approached me in an unorthodox way but it worked.\nwe finally moved in into our new apartment it was expensive apartment but perfect and guess who is my neighbour,micheal we were literally seperated buy just a 2 metre wall. thats how close we were. things were not goin too well for micheal and it forced him to be home more frequent. because i had introduced him to my girl friend as a former high school and college friend she felt she could befriend confide in him and seek protection and compnay from him whenever i was not around.\nrent for those apartments were expensive i was Paying close to about a thousand American dollars in a country that offers salaries in the range of 500. i had to work extra hard. one thing michael was good at was pretending everything was good., was great, was smooth. as i said he is not afraid to be in bebt. because of that he bought cars he took furniture on higher purhcase and i wanted to pay cash for everythin i bought, his life looked well together and more glamorous and because they were spendin a lot of time together she was getting lied to and being sold dreams and fantasies that were never going to come to pass and i began to be looked at as the lazy guy, the dumb guy the too safe of a person .more and more i looked like a failure.\nlook at your friend he has bought a new car we dont have one. he has bought new furniture and we have this ugly crap. why dont you humble yourself and let him teach you a few skills on how to make extra money. you too proud. and your pride wil starve this family. Michael and i supported the same football team arsenal and God knows i tried to get my girl friend to like it too but she always was chelsea fan till Michael convinced her and he started giving her arsenal hoodies wollen hats and just like that she was an arsenal fan.\nconclusion, what i have learnt when you start to get compared to, somehow that person admires respects and likes that person. and wishess you were that person. do i think somethin between them happened yes. i think somethin happened. because from there onwards it was a slippery slope. our relationship never recovered.\nmy reaction sadly i was soft. maybe because i loved her too much. i took in all that bullshit and in front of her did not react but inside it hurt. and it would motivate me to push harder in my hussle but never could compete and catch a break. it hurt seeing her in someone elses clothes and knowing the only reason she is now supporting my team is because of my neighbour . i should have stood my ground and Expressed myself to her but i was a coward then. i never reacted, i kept it all inside me. to this day never told her that comparison crippled me, in terms of my confidence. many times i would feel like hitting her and shouting at her, but also knew i had no leverage she would just pack her bags and leave. i had nothing to actually offer except my love and she kinder made it known with her actions. i should have been bold and state my conditions and if she could not meet them, she should just have to pack her bags and leave and would support my son wherever she would be.", "\ud83e\udd21 I\u2019ll tell ya how\nIm making it clear - this is not my present relationship , these next examples are based on true accounts , dates are not accurate.\nJune 8 1992\n\ud83d\ude12 why cant we go out like that\n\ud83e\udddf\u200d\u2642\ufe0flike what\n\ud83d\ude12 like \u2026.look they got a stretch limmo\n\ud83e\udddf\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026 \u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026 I GAVE HER THE BUSINESS \ud83d\ude2b\n\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nJune 8 1993\n\ud83d\ude12 why cant we get a new bed , the neighbor got her a new bedroom set\n\ud83e\udddf\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026\u2026I GAVE HER THE BUSINESS \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude2b AH AH AH THE EH EH EH BEDS GONNA BREAK !!!

Most of the times a relationship is ruined due to trust issues that creep up due to the distance. Both of you should trust each other and also should learn to give each other the required space. If either person gets worried or jealous do not get angry. On the contrary think that you are blessed with a person who does not see anything else except you.\nBe Loyal - There are many things which we can do when we are away from our loved ones but a broken trust is just like a string which is broken from between. Once broken, it can be joined again but there will be a knot in between life long which cannot be removed.\nGive Each Other time - There may be time differences, there may be work hour differences but make sure either of you give each other ample time and hear out each other about your daily activity. In this way by talking to each other and giving time to each other will make you feel that though there is a physical distance between you two, but your presence is always there with your partner\nLove Truly - Last but not the least.

You make it work.\nI believe that choosing to marrying someone gives a degree of security that nothing else will ever match up to. That is because both of you are actually deciding to be bounded officially by law (and also social standards), that you agree to be exclusive to each other for the rest of your lives. My literature teacher once joked and shared that marriage is like eating cheeseburger. You better make sure that the cheeseburger is awesome because imagine eating that same cheeseburger for the rest of your life!\nBut that said, apart from marriage, people have a very wrong concept of \u201cdoing something major\u201d to make things work. We have always loved intensity. Just like how we wait for an entire season before we watch a TV series; or how we crash diet over a week and hope that it works out for our weight loss. It usually doesn\u2019t last.\nThe opposite of intensity is actually consistency. Just as how brushing your teeth 3 mins twice daily works wonders compared to just visiting the dentist once every 6 months; or how working out 30 mins daily for the month will yield results compared to doing 14 hours at one go. The same applies to relationships as well. It wasn\u2019t a specific thing that your partner or you did for each other that was the turning point (though there a rare exceptions), but it\u2019s those little things like waiting for your partner to finish their work before having a meal with them; or deciding to try out snorkelling even though you don\u2019t really like the ocean. None of these things changed yours or your partners opinion of each other. But it is the accumulation of all these little things (consistently) that made you both one day realise that, \u201cHey, I have feelings for this person.\u201d\nThe last thing I\u2019d leave with you is not to calculate in a relationship, because you will never balance the balance sheet\u2026 ever. Everything is based on perception. What you sacrificed might be worth $1,000,000 to you but to the other person it may just be $50. Love in itself is a conscious decision to make that choice to do so. Ask any married couple and they will tell you the same thing, that love is a choice. Feelings will make it easier, but the key essence is still choice.", "It doesn\u2019t matter the you\u2019ve done It only matters what they believe you\u2019ve done and how much you appreciate them."], "topic_list": ["Relationships", "Understanding Love", "Love Life Advice", "Love", "Relationship Advice", "Philosophy of Everyday Life", "Dating Advice", "Dating and Relationships", "Life and Living", "Life Advice", "Survey Question"], "create_time": "Apr 4, 2020", "question_author": "BlackSwan Si", "view_list": [103, 3, 40, 89, 13, 50, 93, 48, 44, 63, 64, 83, 35], "upvote_list": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0], "name_list": ["Cheryl Terhune", "Skylar Everett", "Shanelle Sithole", "Ashling Winters", "Pranav Rampal", "Darrell Parenteau", "Belle Gayer", "Anastasiia Kos", "Nello Ruocco", "Bernadette Gray", "Fest Smith", "Kenny Cho", "Michael Hannon"]}, "813": {"no_of_view": "3,776", "date_list": ["Apr 14, 2020", "Apr 12, 2020", "Apr 11, 2020", "Apr 11, 2020", "Apr 11, 2020"], "question_title": "Girlfriend wants to break up because her parents are forcing her to get this job that won't give us much time together because it's 12 hours a day full time.

The partners come to expect certain things from the other and it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they don\u2019t appreciate your efforts, it\u2019s just that they forget to mention it. Sometimes, we even \u201ctrain\u201d our partners to take us for granted. We do this by anticipating their wants or needs and take care of things without being asked. If our partner does mention it, we often tend to minimize it. \u201cOh, it was no big deal. I don\u2019t mind doing it.\u201d The way around this is to talk about it. Let your partner know you\u2019d like some acknowledgment for your efforts. Tell them it makes you feel happy when they tell you that they appreciate you. Make sure that you model the treatment you\u2019d like to receive by praising and thanking your partner, too.\nLack of emotion and lack of affection are often the result of a communication lapse. It\u2019s also true that different people show emotion and affection in very different ways. For example, a partner might think they are showing you affection when they shovel the walk before you go to work. If what you really wanted was a hug and a kiss, you\u2019ll probably feel short-changed by the snow free sidewalk. Your partner is going to be confused when you don\u2019t see his act of kindness as an expression of his affection for you. You actually have quite a bit of control of this area because you can initiate a hug without an invitation! You can snuggle up and say, \u201cOh, you just give the best hugs! I feel so loved when you hold me!\u201d You can encourage your partner to be affectionate by being affectionate and by making positive comments when they reciprocate. The other thing you can do is to simply accept that is the way your partner is and try to recognize other ways they show their feelings for you.\nRespect, on the other hand, is nearly impossible to \u201cteach\u201d someone. Treating someone with respect is a tacit understanding that you are both equal in the relationship.

Initially in relationships it might be about looks but after a while it fades away because once you get into a relationship your partner would look for the qualities and that is what makes you special your personality because we know eventually looks would fade away and after a while it is not going to last but it is the personality and the real person in you which is the deal so initially you might groom yourself and look good then get into a relationship.

After this we eventually got back together and were way better for it. I truly think if we had tried to stay together it would have turned into a toxic relationship or we would've broken up.

Other things fell apart but the sex was never the issue. Now I am not saying it didn't slow a little . Never enough to warrant concern.", "Sadly it is true, of many people who are married a long time. Obviously there will people who claim to have a sex life when they are 75 but they are the exception or lying. Life typically goes as follows; boy and girl meet, fall in love, get engaged and get married, and by the 1980s most girls were not virgins like me but it was something their mums always wished for. Forgetting any pre marital sex, after the wedding and now hopefully living in their own home, the average couple would really have the best sex of their lives. With just the two of you, sex could be without inhibition, more or less when you wanted it and were you wanted it; I think we did it in every room, the stairs and the car. The stockings and suspenders and brief knickers, the role plays, the spanking, the running naked around the house all remind me of getting dripping wet, with the expectation. You could dress up, go out clubbing, go for a meal and come home with no knickers and make some noise and scream at orgasm.The absolute best time for this period is in your 20s, as you have the energy. So this regular sex carries on for an average of seven years, which is the time couples may be struggling to get their own home, and build a work career. This can put pressure on the relationship for couples now in their early thirties. Sex is less regular due to external pressure of work but in some respects can be due to the \u2018 been there done that feeling\u2018 of boredom in the bedroom. Sex becomes routine, and is a struggle to keep regular. It might vary from being a job of work, to still being passionate but just a little less often. Sadly, the marriage can either end here with the seven year itch, as either party goes off with a younger person, or the real love and affection comes out and the couple recognise that they should have the children they want some day. While the sex will never be the same as the 'dripping wet\u2019 orgasmic fun it used to be, the couple who stay together now replace a certain amount of passion for monthly charts and thermometers and him having to have lots of sex either side of ovulation day! The children are born which gives the couple a new purpose in life and this hopefully carries on until their are brothers and sisters to care for. While kids are small and in bed there is some time for some sex but not anything too wild, so as not to wake the kids. Once the kids grow and start to question things and by the time they are teenage, its nearly impossible for mum and dad to get it together, and extremely embarrassing for the kids to listen through the walls as mum starts to make some noise on orgasm. About this time in the marriage, medical matters conspire to reduce the sex, such being overweight or arthritis, or the need for viagra, or the need for a hysterectomy, so sex is almost dead, and the marriage continues in for the companionship and the support they give as grandparents. This might seem a sorry tail and give a depressing outlook for the future but sadly it is very nearly the same for everyone. Incidentally it annoys me when they interview a couple who have been married 70 years who say they have never had a disagreement. They have had a marriage based on one party rule and no dissension in the ranks! My advice therefore for couples starting out is to have more sex, as after the initial years it is so easy to be distracted and think tomorrow is another day, when in fact there is a vagina next to the guy in bed waiting to be used!", "This is true this is true for some, not true for others, and entirely backwards for still others.

There\u2019s definitely a great pedagogical relationship between polar opposites, for instance:\nINTJs can learn how to live in the moment (spontaneity) whereas ESFP can learn strategical planning.\nINTJs can learn how to be expressive and ESFP can learn when to actually shut up and listen.\nINTJs can learn to mature their inner feeling and ESFP can learn how to mature their outer thinking.\nThere\u2019s high respect between both types, but I would recommend a casual relationship between both of them. Whatever they do, they should avoid roommate and loving relationships.

The \u201cshould\u201d in this question is a bit of a misnomer.\nKnowing about your partner\u2019s past does teach you a lot about them. It can tell you who they\u2019ve usually been attracted, why their relationship ended, and what you can expect in a relationship. Additionally, they may share stories of how they\u2019ve grown or what alterations they\u2019ve made when it comes to approaching romantic relationships.\nSo in a way, a general knowledge about your partner\u2019s past can be useful, and it can offer you insight into their experience, and possibly foreshadow what to expect.\nHowever, if you want to know about their past in detail- and if you are the type to overthink, self-doubt, and are easily made insecure- then knowing about your partner\u2019s past is not in your best self interest, and it is also not useful for the relationship. While you can listen to their experiences to get an idea of their past- this does not neatly predict how the relationship will unfold.\nSo if you learn about their past and it becomes an obsession, or a point of lowered self esteem- I have seen people manifest the thing that they fear most.\nFor example- if you anticipate something catastrophic in your relationship, this generally means you pull out a bit. You act distant, suspicious, and pre-emptively contemptuous. Or, you may have suspicions when there is no reason to be suspicious. This can create all sorts of unhealthy dynamics.\nSo evaluate your reasoning for wanting to know someone pasts. A final note- is that some personality types are manipulative and controlling. And some partners who have narcissistic traits may pry about your past as a means to control you. If they know what you have tolerated- they will know how far they can push your boundaries. Additionally- I have had clients experience partners who threatened to blackmail them with personal information, or use that information to shame them.\nSo it is again important to be clear about your motives for knowing someone\u2019s past. And it is important to know the ways it may benefit or act as a detriment.\nTo give a personal example- my partner and I once played the \u201c20 question game\u201d, late at night since we couldn\u2019t fall asleep. We both revealed particular details about our past. We both ended up feeling hurt, and knowing information that was really not beneficial to know. Long story short, we can joke about it now- but for a while it became a real point of insecurity- to have particular moments of our previous relationships revealed. We have always been committed to honesty- but I can safely say that some details are better left unsaid. There are some parts of my partner\u2019s past that I would be better off not knowing- particularly because they play no role in the present.", "No. Live in the present.", "No, I love who they are now, not who they were.\nThat being said, a bit of their past must be known so that you don't needlessly give your heart to a user/taker incapable of love", "No.\nAnd in a practical sense.

So I can\u2019t just give this information upon request anyway.\nI wouldn\u2019t expect anybody to do the same.\nAnd really. Most of what you need to know to be happy is the experience of being with that person.\nPast does not predict future. It\u2019s a big, big fallacy that is active all over the place in modernity.

They all boil down to shifting one from unhealthy ways of relating and forming bonds, to healthier ways.\nAlso, you\u2019d find out that most emotionally unavailable people hardly recognize they\u2019re emotionally unavailable, until something happens to crack their wall. Then, the awareness takes root of their condition.\nIf you\u2019ve just realized you\u2019re emotionally unavailable, this is what I advice:\nTackle the situation that caused you to gain this awareness. The best place to start is always from what triggered you to gain the awareness.\nAscertain whether you\u2019re a self-healer or interpersonal healer (you need support to heal). This will help you determine whether to go solo or to seek help either professionally or in a group.\nIf you\u2019re a self-healer, begin with your immediate reality. Was it a romantic relationship that cracked you? Was it loss of a loved one? Was it losing a job? Begin with the immediate context. This jumpstarts you on an organic path through the challenge.\nBe uninhibited. Whatever the reality unfolding, work with it and go with the flow. This means researching if that\u2019s what you feel inclined to. Talking to a friend if that\u2019s what you feel inclined to. Journaling if that\u2019s what you feel inclined to. Sleeping your life away if that\u2019s what you feel inclined to. Be exactly what the moment requires.\nChoose you. When faced with the option between you and a reality you\u2019ve outgrown, choose you. In my experience, emotional unavailability is largely caused by past experiences of always being invalidated, and building beliefs around it that prevent you from having to feel that way again. So, the moment you begin to validate yourself by choosing you, those beliefs begin to crumble, and you form new ones.\nWhat helped me was my becoming more aware of myself and all that I am.\nIf you\u2019re a self-healer and you\u2019d like to try that route, feel free to check out my space The Self Aware Individual.\nI\u2019ve also catalogued my journey thus far on my blog;\nBlog - Farida Muktar\nMaybe you\u2019d find some of my experiences and lessons helpful.\nFeel free to buzz me up if there are specific challenges you\u2019d like to brainstorm about.\nPeace be unto you.", "i am usually emotionally available just I haven\u2019t had more than a night of sleep in 4 days (and many electrocutions)"], "topic_list": [], "create_time": "Apr 8, 2020", "question_author": "Mia A", "view_list": [22, 1, 44, 108, 3], "upvote_list": [0, 0, 0, 2, 0], "name_list": ["Richard Lunsford", "Rebecca Cogar", "Anastasiia Kos", "Farida Muktar", "Steven Parada"]}, "448": {"no_of_view": "81", "date_list": [], "question_title": "What is the relationship between Mathilde and Madame Forestiere in the necklace?", "no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 0, "ans_list": [], "topic_list": ["The Necklace (short story)", "Necklaces", "Jewelry", "Relationships", "Dating and Relationships"], "create_time": "Apr 12, 2020", "question_author": "Bashayer Alghamdi.", "view_list": [], "upvote_list": [], "name_list": []}, "898": {"no_of_view": "485", "date_list": ["Mar 30, 2020", "Mar 30, 2020", "Mar 30, 2020", "Mar 30, 2020"], "question_title": "How can I mentally train myself to give up on relationships and friendships and settle for sex?", "no_of_follower": 1, "respond_collected": 4, "ans_list": ["The psychological literature on this says you can't.

What matters is he knows what he ultimately wants, what ultimately his heart desires. These new girls may come and go and you cannot control that but if your guy is sensible enough to know that what he wants is you he will come back.\nAlso regarding you asking him to lessen his contact with that girl.

My first relationship had a girl who ended up liking my partner and made all the attempts to break us apart, after we broke up i got to know she had visited him several times drunk and even tried to make out. My second relationship was with a guy who had a bestfriend with whom he had made out for 3 months and the girl ended up finding someone else leaving him heartbroken, worst apart about this even when i was dating him she was controlling him, it turned out he was also very clingy and attached to his bestfriend's girlfriend in the past. And my third relationship was with somebody who had a very annoying friend whom he liked in the past, he later on went to date few other girls as well and this woman used to suggest breaking up because she used to think it won't last. well, what's similar is that they too had a past, she once got so drunk, sat on his lap and tried kissing him, well she says on the cheeks only. this act was to stopped by her bestfriend and he himself but m question is what if they wouldnt have stopped her ? later on when i confronted her about this because i wasnt liking the way she used to get all over him or kept asking him to meet or the way he kept sending her kisses and \"i love you's\" she said it wasn't intentional. So if they wouldn't have stopped her and he himself would would have let go is it still called unintentional? Do you girls also happen to face these problems? There are certain lines and boundaries to a friendship which musnt be crossed. My partners mum and sister had also suggested him to stay away! alas only he couldn't see it. I too have bestfriend's of the opposite gender and it's been over 10 years to 15th years since we are friends but not once have i or him ended up in such situations.

Because of my lungs, wearing a mask is difficult because of the steam build up. My son designed masks for himself so that I can use a paper mask that he got from the clinic he goes to. This has probably been harder for him than me. I don\u2019t need much actual social contact because my friends and family are all on Facebook.

You have to rewire your thoughts without him and make connections to yourself. Finding yourself again when your whole identity was wrapped in one person is hard, so you need backup.

If we cant find another to commit to us in a long term relationship, and there are co-dependency issues to deal with, address those first then move on.\n(Moving on doesn't always mean you have to go somewhere).\nIf you were in a co-dependent relationship which was also, toxic, then you will need to do some inner work on your own issues before you are ready to move on and embark on a new relationship or just moving on in your life - alone. Don't go back to the toxic relationship, of course.\nWhat was the basis of the co-dependency exactly? It is likely you are missing all the \u2018good parts\u2019 of your previous relationship and forgetting the sides of it that were toxic. Were you really on the same page as the person from your previous relationship? Did you have the same ideas about life that they had? Were you joined together as a team??

The other person must have also developed some level of dependency on you, so its important you don't tread on them like they are an unwanted insect under your feet. Try to end the relationship thoughtfully with respect to the close bond you have made.\nThere is nothing worse than someone cutting out a best friend / love who they have a very special close bond with by being too brutal or cruel about the ending part. In theory you should apply to the same amount of effort you went to at the start and give a lot more respect and consideration. But of course, most people never do that.\nThis is someone that you relied on for something, and you needed and someone that was important to you in some way for survival or love or hope , whatever. Its going to be hard for you to cut them out of your life, just as it is going to be hard for them to adapt to life without you. Be sure you know why you are doing this.

So im guessing a month or less to go for me. You have to remember if it was years and you have kids. Maybe your ex has questions about electronics, housing stuff.

Is your ex asking for you back?", "One thing I learned long ago is never count on anyone else for anything. I was married for 17 years and we had our bills. Those bills were higher than either of us could afford on our own but together it was fine. He got injured and hooked on pain killers, stopped working and the bills didn\u2019t disappear. I could not afford it on my own, I sold a lot of things we really didn\u2019t need just to get by. My house went into foreclosure and I stopped paying all my credit cards. I finally was able to get things back on track without help from him. When he did start working again I was able to put that money in savings because I didn\u2019t need it. I ended up filing for divorce and started over. Even then I told myself I would never buy something or live somewhere that I could not afford on my own.\nSo being codependent makes things that much harder or escape. I\u2019m not sure if you work at all, that\u2019s another mistake so many make. It really is bad when you need someone in your life but don\u2019t want them. I would rather want them but not need them. I would hate to be on the other end as well. I wouldn\u2019t want to wonder if someone. Was only with me becaus they couldn\u2019t make it on their own.\nOnce you start making your own money and paying your own bills you will have a sense of empowerment. It feels like you e made it in life and everything will be fine. I have always been a very independent person and figures things out on my own. Anyone can do it, you just have to know it\u2019s not as hard as it seems to start over. It\u2019s actually nice to be alone and take care of yourself.

You began to feel grateful that you left the toxic relationship, you will be free and much happier.\nI recommend going to the GYM, reading self-help books, watching movies or shows that uplift you. If your ex does happen to cross your mind remember the good times but also remember why you walked away in the first place.\nYou could also write a letter getting all your feelings out, it will help you let this person go.

One day I woke up and caught her sneaking in the house after screwing the neighbor and just didn\u2019t care. She thought it was her green light to screw who ever she wanted and the next time she left I packed my things, called her mom then just left. She called me the next day screaming about how i tatted her out to her mom and left her like a coward and I just hung up on her. This was the late 1990s and cell phones weren\u2019t as big so I was able to get away from her constant crap long enough to find myself again. Time was what it took to leave and time is what it took to move on. The longer I was away the less I wanted to go back.

Humans tend to live in our past and our future and forget that the most power and satisfaction comes from living in the present. How do we do that, when we are in the midst of transitioning from a relationship to hopefully a friendship? It\u2019s easy to want to dwell here. Rehashing all the good or the bad. Guess what? It won\u2019t change anything. It\u2019s just going to make you miserable.\nFind one good friend that you can vent to about anything and use them as your \u201cpast regret\u201d friend. When shit comes up, call them. And the most you can vent is for five minutes (which to your friend may feel like forever). Then stop. ( I used to set a timer for myself when I caught myself feeling sorry for myself over relationship transitions. For ten minutes I was supposed to wallow in self-pity and do nothing else. After three or four minutes, I\u2019d start laughing.)\nWhen you find yourself mired in the past, stop and think about all the good things in the present. No matter how crappy you feel there will be good things out there if you just look. Take the time to write them down, so you can revisit them when you\u2019re feeling stuck.\nForgiveness\nBe forgiving of yourself and the other person. We all make mistakes and we all grow and move in different ways. Seldom is there truly a \u201cbad guy\u201d when relationships transition. Usually we grow apart or our lives take sudden twists and the relationship is no longer what it was. And sometimes that means moving on. Being able to forgive yourself for what seems to be your part in this, is the first step.\nForgiving them is the next. Human beings make mistakes and you and your partner are humans. Don\u2019t make them into an evil person or a hero.\nTake time apart.\nUsually one of the people involved hopeful that there will be some sort of reconnection and that everything will go back to normal. That seldom happens. I\u2019m a huge advocate of staying friends if at all possible when you transition out of a relationship. The best way to do that is to take time to be apart. If both of you are in agreement, set a date for lunch or coffee at least two months into the future. Then meet and check-in with each other.\nOf course if there are kids involved or other things that require you to interact then a different tactic will be needed. The best thing to do in these circumstances is to have only contact as necessary and to take even a few more months before that solo lunch date.\nNothing is forever\nWe get caught up sometime in the fairy tales of relationships and when they are over, we feel like a failure because we didn\u2019t find \u201cthe one\u201d. Which means we negate all the good of the relationship and act as if we\u2019ve wasted our time on the one that just \u201cfailed\u201d. You didn\u2019t fail, you lived. And living has its ups and its downs.\nNothing is forever and we need to remember that the impermanence of life is what gives us a reason to live and explore and to celebrate. Instead of looking at the future with dread, look at it as the next adventure.\nGifts\nEvery relationship brings you gifts. Even the worst relationships bring you gifts if you take the time to look at them. Acknowledge the gifts that you received.\nCelebrate you!\nCelebrate your awesomeness (which is what attracted the former partner in the first place). Know that you are whole and complete just the way you are. That while you may want someone else in your life, you don\u2019t need them.\n\\", "This time is all about you. Find things that make you feel good to do, that aren't vices like smoking or drinking. Do the things you could never do in your toxic relationship.

But Dating isn\u2019t marriage. Due to most people Date for marriage, in the west we are seen people confuse Dating to be same as marriage. Dating and marriage are 2 completely different things. Marriage is 2 people becoming Life Partner, Sexual Mate and a Couple till divorce. As for Dating. Dating for marriage is 2 people socialize a bit with romantic intent, to determine whether they want to be together. If the answer is yes, they become a Couple, if the answer is no, they separate. Dating for fun, is 2 people sexually interest in each other, start hanging out a bit. After a period of time, one of two things would happen, (A) They like each other so much and felt they are compatible and become a Couple, this is what is usually refer to as \u201ccasual relationship turn serious\u201d or (B) after having a bit of fun, the relationship end. But sometime it doesn\u2019t end on good term. This usually happen when, one party confuse Dating to be same as marriage. So, for example when both party know it is a casual thing, it is unlikely a girl would complain about a guy dumping her after the sex and likely the guy won\u2019t care too much about the girl dating another guy, without telling him. If one party is dating for fun and other is dating for marriage, it depends. If the party dating for marriage, isn\u2019t the type that confuse dating to be same as marriage, this is less likely to be the problem and the girl most likely won\u2019t sleep with the guy, till they are a Couple and guy probably won\u2019t care too much about her dating other guys, he probably be seen other girls also. (But that is providing if both parties are reasonable people) and then there are those that confuse dating to be same as marriage, this is where we start seen girls saying \u201che is treating a woman like crap for dumping him after the sex\u201d and guys accusing their girlfriend of Cheating, for seen other guys. Because, none of those things are OK, within a Spouse relationship. And if 2 people has become a Couple, dumping a girl after the sex, that is simply not cool. Usually in abusive relationship, the abuser want the relationship to move forward and become serious, exclusive and committed very quickly, due to it help to entrap the girl within a commitment. Most abuser, got very little to loose due to such commitment, because most abusers are narcissist beta male thugs. Narcissist got strong desire for admiration, if he is an alpha male he be the type of boyfriend that sleep with all your friends. But if he is a beta male, he can\u2019t get girls, but as a thug, he care not who he hurt getting what he wants.

It\u2019s going to hurt, but it\u2019s going to hurt a lot more if you keep her in your life.\nFirst, the legal problems. Was the marriage legally recognized, by a marriage certificate or equivalent? The law doesn\u2019t care if the marriage was secret or not. If you do have a legally valid marriage, you should legally divorce, because otherwise you are still entangled with this person. Depending on local laws, you might not be able to date other people without being accused of adultery, which means you might end up having to pay your ex a lot of money. So, I\u2019d start there. If it wasn\u2019t a legally-recognized marriage (but was recognized by the Hindu faith as being valid), then I\u2019m not sure what you have to do, as I don\u2019t know what the rules are concerning divorce in that faith.\nSecond, interpersonal: basically, you should break off contact, and look for somebody else (after taking care of any legal/cultural prohibitions against seeing someone else). Getting dumped really sucks, I\u2019ve been there. But there are other people out there. You just have to move on.\nThird, cultural: are other people going to look down on you because you are in this situation? Here I\u2019m not so sure what to say, because I admit I\u2019m not really familiar with your culture. But I will say, if you think that you have an accurate analysis of the situation, trust that analysis, even if you are being pressured to see things differently. Again, hard to do, but you have to trust the fact that your family, friends, or priest will not be in possession of as many facts as you are.

Empathize with the reader.\nDo your best to understand the other person\u2019s side. What might they have felt to behave that way? What untold struggles have they been facing?\nBy bringing this up, you\u2019ll make the other person feel important and you\u2019ll both find common ground.\n3. Share support\nYou should say what you expect from this relationship in terms of behavior and support. What can you do to help each other? Are your goals aligned?\nIf you follow these 3 steps, you\u2019ll set a neutral environment to address the issue and the reader will most likely become less defensive.\nHowever, lasting relationships are not only about resolving conflict but also about nurturing.\nSo let me show you how to write a letter to express gratitude and appreciation.\nPaint the scenario\nFirst of all, you should write an introduction to grab the reader\u2019s attention and make him or her want to read the letter.\nHere you\u2019ll write something that you know the person would agree with you, whether it is a background story about what you\u2019ve been through together or a fun fact about your relationship. But the reader has to think \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s true!\u201d\n2. Say what you admire about the other person.\nThis is a good exercise even to you because by thinking about the other person\u2019s traits, you might notice some good attributes that you haven\u2019t noticed before.\n3. Specific appreciation.\nThis step works wonders because now you get the chance to show the reader how much you care and notice about him or her. Describing deeply why you\u2019re thankful for what they\u2019ve been doing is an excellent way to strengthen bonds between you two.\nWe know that perfect relationships are an illusion and we should never set unrealistic expectations for ourselves nor for others.

Trust plays a huge factor in this, and this is something I\u2019ve seen many ladies especially (not always, but normally it\u2019s the gals) get upset about. Of course I would imagine that the wife or girlfriend looks at the Insta model and immediately feels threatened, and/or thinks her man is getting off to her pics or sexually fantasizing about her.\nIt may seem kinda weird, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m gonna get the, \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re a female!\u201d response, but I deal with many, MANY jacked, ripped dudes on a daily basis (not that my hubby isn\u2019t one sexy jacked mofo ;) ), but I have NEVER thought anything more about ANY of them other than, \u201cDude, you\u2019ve worked your ass off and you look great. Fucking congrats man.\u201d There\u2019s no sexual fantasy, no further mind play. IMO there\u2019s a huge difference in being able to admire someone\u2019s physique, and sexually fantasizing about them. I\u2019m not sure what your personal reasons are for wanting to follow these ladies, but if you find yourself with more sexual thoughts than thoughts of general \u2018damn she is hot, how can a body be so nice, wow she\u2019s worked her ass off,\u2019 then maybe you need to sit and re-evaluate a few things, especially if you\u2019re in a committed relationship with a gal who you KNOW would be put-off by the simple act of you following this other gal.\nHowever it really depends on the couple. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve sent my husband a photo of some other insta model\u2019s boobs/body and been like, \u201cDude, THAT is nice.\u201d (I\u2019m 100% straight, just in case you were also wondering). It\u2019s often that I\u2019m showing HIM photos of other chicks that I think are just gorgeous. I very much appreciate the beauty of the physique and often look at photos of others in near nude garb, and there\u2019s never an inkling of a sexual thought. But I also do realize that my marriage might be a bit of a rarity for a few reasons- first is that I\u2019ve busted me ASS to attain a sexy physique. I KNOW I look good (please spare the comments- I\u2019m not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, nor do I pretend to be, and that\u2019s fine. But I knew what I wanted and I have worked for the last 7 years to try to make it a reality). My confidence is probably higher than the average. Couple that with the fact that I TRUST MY HUSBAND WITH MY LIFE, and boom \u2014 instant recipe for \u2018Hey babe check out this chicks boobs!\u2019 (Not trying to be vulgar- that REALLY happens here in this house! Lol). Don\u2019t really need to say more about that. But if these factors are lacking, then issues in the relationship may arise, and I would speculate that they would revolve primarily around both insecurity and trust (or lack of trust).\nSome individuals are just wired in a way that would never allow for them to be comfortable with it. I have a friend who has flat out told me, \u201cHailey, I just could never do what you do, no offense, and I couldn\u2019t imagine ever being okay with her (girlfriend) following a bunch of other shirtless dudes\u201d (my friend is a guy). So there really are many factors to consider, and this whole, \u201cShould I follow that sexy Insta model\u201d really is up to what you and your partner deem acceptable. I would definitely suggest bringing it up and discussing it with them. Elaborate as to what your intentions are in following the people that you want to follow, and ask them if they have any issues with it.\nTHAT IS THE SHORT VERSION. BUT I would like to add some input on my mental progression with confidence and self-esteem issues as the years have progressed and my physique has continued to improve. I will elaborate on both my prior outlook as the insecure girlfriend, as well as my current outlook.\nAgain, I realize my physique isn\u2019t the cats meow for everyone; I did what I needed to do to attain MY version of the ideal female physique (and I\u2019m still working on it!). It has ALWAYS been about getting to that point where I\u2019m satisfied with my physique (I\u2019m not there and honestly don\u2019t think it will ever come), BUT this question had me stop and rewind time 7 years - back before any of my lifting endeavors. Back when my physique was nothing more than that of the \u2018straight up and down\u2019 of a boy\u2019s body. Back when my confidence was buried under the baggy clothes that worked so well to hide the shame I harbored for my body. Of course, 7 years of time has allowed me to grow into a much more mentally secure person (in general), but I can\u2019t deny that I would have felt vulnerable and threatened if my then-boyfriend 7 years ago would have shown me a photo of some curvy, gorgeous Insta model. It\u2019s true. But it\u2019s quite interesting to analyze how I\u2019M now the one showing my husband photos of these other ladies.\nI\u2019ve never been one who has an easy time holding her tongue. The older I get, the more prone I am to dispensing that stone cold, seemingly heartless line of truth that everyone is thinking but no one else will dare utter. When the idiot spouts off at the mouth, I\u2019m generally the one in the room who will be the first to pipe up. I find this quality exacerbating as the years progress, and I must add that I feel a bit\u2026\u2026 bitter towards most. The reasons are quite numerous, honestly, but there\u2019s one I particular reason that is quite fitting for this discussion. Please pardon me, as this is really turning into a lengthy piece.\nTwo quotes have stuck with me throughout the entirety of my life, and one of them is the following, \u201cThere is no such thing as an ugly woman; just a lazy, uninformed one.\u201d Now please, I KNOW my faults, and my imperfections are too numerous to count. I don\u2019t want to give the impression that I\u2019m rooting my own horn, but holy shit have I put in my time. While in college I scouted for and found a job that would allow me to work minimal hours for maximal dough (a high-school sports photography job). Time was a precious resource for me and every extra hour I had was dedicated to reading. Reading and reading and reading and READING. The journal articles, the pubmed studies, the blog posts by the experts in the field - I was OBSESSED, and was often locked away in the room I rented for 300 bucks (bills included ;) ). I knew what I wanted my physique to look like, and I knew that I knew that I had to put in my time in the books to make my time in the gym the most efficient as possible.\nI was OBSESSED. I knew what I wanted and did what I had to do to make things work. There was no time for the whole pity party of \u2018poor me I\u2019m so insecure and self-conscious.\u2019 My schedule included classes and work, but I MADE time. How? I scouted for a job that paid me $100 per hour. I rented a room from a lady for $300 per month, and often cleaned the rest of her home (and her car and her mother\u2019s home) for deductions in my rent. Often times I was paying $150\u2013$200 in rent, with a total of $400-$600 in expenses per month. Of course this meant that my monthly expenses were paid for by working just a measly 4\u20136 hours a week. I drove a \u201899 Camry so gas was cheap. My only other expense was car insurance. I cut out every other unnecessary expense. Those were the days of using email and facebook to contact people (mooching off free WiFi) since I refused to pay for monthly cell service. My splurging was spending 20 bucks at the local thrift store for a few new shirts, and maybe 5 bucks at a local bakery on Sunday. Sales at the grocery store were my go-to, to the point of even asking if they would just give me their old \u2018no good\u2019 throw away veggies (they couldn\u2019t due to legal reasons. I then countered and said I\u2019ll sign any liability waiver\u2026 nope \ud83d\ude15 lol). I ate the cactus out of my own backyard to save money. I fucking MADE IT WORK. I MADE time for my schooling, my studies (studies meaning gym-related studies), as well as the actual lifting. It has been a long 7 years, but I have scrapped and scrounged every minute to be able to change my life and attain the things I want most.\nI used to be that self-conscious girl. Sure, I still have my moments, and there are some things that can\u2019t be changed no matter how much work we invest. BUT there\u2019s a great deal that we CAN do. You DO have the time- you just aren\u2019t hungry enough to MAKE the time. You AREN\u2019T HUNGRY ENOUGH to make it work, and you aren\u2019t willing to do whatever is within your control to change your life- and potentially your outlook.\nMy experiences have definitely given me a new perspective to this whole \u2018self esteem\u2019 issue. I\u2019ve had other trainers comment and tell me that women they\u2019ve worked with have done complete mental 180 (with regards to self-esteem) as they\u2019ve trained into a physique they\u2019re now satisfied with. Many ladies (and men also, of course) are quick to sit back and get upset that some of these models even exist, but they won\u2019t lift one finger to change a thing about themselves or their situation. Many times, their only issue with you looking at photos of other women is their own insecurity. Yet instead of stepping up and trying to better themselves, they'll forever sit in their slump and place restrictions on YOU. Again, there are certainly those individuals who have other issues with the issue of the question asked- issues that have nothing to do with insecurity/self esteem, and that\u2019s understandable. But many, MANY ladies (and men!) are quick to shackle you and forever leave it at that because they\u2019re absolutely unwilling to step up to the plate to try to better themselves.\nSure, one day I\u2019ll be old and withered \u2014 that\u2019s life. But I\u2019ll also be old and withered right next to the individual who I trust with my life and I know will stick with me through anything. I\u2019ll probably miss my tight physique when I\u2019m 90, and will look back at how my glutes were as shapely as they were, how my ab and forearm veins would always make their appearance. I\u2019ll probably be old and sad about the fact that the things I once worked so hard for have withered away in what seemed like a blink of the eye.

If you are afraid to bring up something that bothers you, hurts you or upsets you, then that is not healthy.\n4-Healthy Boundaries: In a healthy relationship each person knows and respects the other\u2019s boundaries. Ignoring those boundaries and pushing the other person too far is one of the fastest ways to destroy trust and ruin a healthy relationship.\n5-Security: You should never feel afraid or threatened. Both partners should have anger control, and be able to argue or fight respectfully if issues or differences arise. No name calling or belittling should be tolerated on either side.

I don\u2019t want a woman with a long history of toxic relationships because it shows that she doesn\u2019t value herself. I dated a woman back in the day and all of her boyfriends cheated and verbally abused her.

I had to jump through hoops to prove to her that I wasn\u2019t like her exes. I won\u2019t serve time for crimes that her exes committed. That\u2019s why I no longer date untreated victims of cheating and abusive relationships because they tend to bring that baggage to our relationship. I\u2019m worthy of trusting, loving, kind, and stable relationship and I won\u2019t settle for less. I enter relationships to add to my life and add to hers.

I also know people in unhealthy, dysfunctional polyamorous relationships.\nLike any relationship, it depends on the people in the relationship. But in general, I would not assume that a polyamorous relationship is any less functional than a monogamous one.", "No, I do not think poly relationships can function as monogamous relationships. If we settled for that low standard, all our relationships would blow up.\nI know some individual people in monogamous relationships who have happy, healthy relationships. But you do not NEED to have a happy, healthy relationship in order to maintain a monogamous one. Our entire culture is set up to support monogamy, whether it\u2019s happy or healthy or not.\nThe focus on monogamy in our culture is on longevity, not health or happiness. Oh, sure, we pay lip service to happiness, what with relationship counseling and self-help books and all. But the happiness is the *tool* meant to encourage *longevity*. Longevity is the goal here, sometimes at all costs.\nAs long as a monogamous relationships last until somebody dies, it\u2019s considered a \u201csuccess\u201d. This kind of pressure traps people in relationships. We make it harder for them to leave relationships with resistance to no-fault divorce laws, with capitalism encouraging people to pool resources just for survival, with social disapproval for breakups.\nIt\u2019s better to stay together than it is to break up, in monogamy. If you break up, your relationship has failed.\nSince staying together is the *cultural* goal, people don\u2019t really need very good relationship skills because the culture is motivated to support the continued existence of the monogamous relationship. We push people together whether they\u2019re compatible or ready to handle a relationship or not. People learn all kinds of horrible things designed to keep people together and they don\u2019t learn any of the things they need to foster happiness and good emotional health in interdependent relationships.\nPeople do not learn how to communicate. They don\u2019t learn how to listen. They don\u2019t learn the art of compassionate negotiation. They don\u2019t learn how to fight ethically. They DEFINITELY do not learn how to apologize.\nPeople learn things like manipulation and control to get what they want. They learn to feel possessive over other people\u2019s things like their bodies, their emotions, their time. They don\u2019t learn how to respect each other\u2019s agency, in fact they learn explicitly how to DISrespect other people\u2019s agency. People don\u2019t learn empathy. People learn to treat their partners as need fulfillment machines. It\u2019s possible to be monogamous and not do these things, but these things are baked into the culture at a foundational level, and often how relationships stay together in the first place.\nIf poly relationships functioned like monogamous relationships, they would all be doomed. When you add all the shitty things people learn in monogamy and you take away the cultural support pressuring people to stay together (because there is no cultural support for polyamory), and then you pile several relationships like this on top of each other, you get one big mass of dysfunction.\nEven with the cultural pressure to stay together in relationships, monogamous marriages still have an average of 50% divorce rate, with a 100% breakup rate of every relationship that came before The One they chose to marry.\nIf that\u2019s the standard we\u2019re holding relationships to, then yeah, I think poly relationships hold up just fine. We don\u2019t have any statistics on breakups in poly relationships, but my anecdotal observation as a community organizer and educator is that this is about right. Poly people marry and divorce about as often as monogamous people do, and they break up with about as many people as monogamous people do. The only real difference in the rates is that poly people don\u2019t typically break up *in order to be with someone else*. That kinda defeats the purpose of being poly. If anything, we might have *slightly* less than 100% breakup rate of anyone who isn\u2019t a spouse, simply because we don\u2019t have to break up with them in order to get a spouse.\nSo, just looking at how often relationships end, poly relationships are probably roughly about as long-lived as monogamous ones. Poly people are people, after all. We still have to find compatible partners and we still grow and change over time which affects our relationships. Just like monogamous people.\nBut if you\u2019re looking at the *health* and *happiness* of poly relationships, or if you\u2019re looking at the quality of the *relationship skills* in poly relationships? Then no, I don\u2019t think poly relationships could function with such low standards.\nI believe poly relationships require much higher levels of relationship skills in order to both produce happiness in the participants and create longevity in relationships. But we also don\u2019t idolize longevity quite as strongly as monogamous people do either. We are slightly more likely to consider a relationship a \u201csuccess\u201d based on the happiness quotient over the longevity quotient. So with different metrics judging \u201csuccess\u201d, that\u2019s yet one more standard that poly relationships and monogamous relationships can\u2019t be compared to each other.\nNot only will I never be in a monogamous relationship again, I will also never date another monogamous *person* again. Even those who have spent the time and effort learning good relationship skills typically do not have the level of relationship skills that I require in my partners.\nIn fact, if I didn\u2019t happen to be heterosexual, I wouldn\u2019t even date straight *men* anymore either, since men, on average, have fewer skills than women simply because monogamous culture places the burden of maintaining a relationship on people socialized as women and men can, typically, coast along on their female partners\u2019 efforts.

I Have stated many times over that the secret to a successful relationship is compromise. When I say this it means for example, say I want to go fishing for awhile and want my wife to let me go with friends on a trip. How do I accomplish this feat? Well I know that there is a ballet or opera coming up she wants to attend but I don't because I think its boring but i need to think of her interest and needs and do the things she wants in order to get her to mutually meet my needs and interest. That is what I mean by a compromise, by not being selfish or self centered. I never compromise on a conflict or argument, especially if it means my morals or values are at stake. I Don't care how much it pisses off my wife. What I will do is listen carefully to what she says, get her opinion on the matter and offer my opinion. Of course sometimes its impossible to work out a solution but we at least try to work out something. It sounds like every time you have an argument its with someone who doesn't listen to or value your opinion so I'm guessing by compromise you mean the conflict altogether never gets resolved and you never really get your point across so you end up dropping the issue. By now after dealing with this for awhile you are feeling disrespected and resentful. It might be at a point where your partner needs to hear from an independent third person's view such as a councillor. Hopefully he is willing to go or put in some effort otherwise its pointless. If you want you can personally reply to this so i might be able to help more in depth. I Hope this answer helps a little. Have a nice Easter.", "In compromise, both people move.

You don't know how to be romantic without going too far and you are allowing the relationship to get more intimate, dramatic and serious than the commitment and trust justify.\nYou don't understand that dating is for marriage, that marriage is for children, that sex is for marriage and children, that men need to earn your trust, and that God is the Prince of Peace and the key to happiness.", "Well, I believe that you may be scared of relationships because you probably haven\u2019t had the best experiences before. Or maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re afraid to get hurt in them but it\u2019s definitely okay to feel this way.\nWe all have to realize that getting into relationships can have negative and positive outcomes. Whether they are extremely good or extremely bad. But with all that in mind, we choose to be in them because well, they can make us happy and of course there will always be ups and downs. No relationship is perfect and they are not expected to be. But that is why you and the other person have to be a team to fix any problem together. You should be able to trust the other person if you are going to be in a relationship with them.\nTo answer your question, I have gone through this before and well it was because I felt insecure about myself. I didn\u2019t love myself and I truly thought that I was never ever going to find someone who loved me. But I was wrong, trust me, there is someone for everybody. I don\u2019t know about the way you feel about yourself, but you maybe have to focus on yourself to find who you are as a person and for your well being, to be happy with the person you have created yourself to be. I suggest for you to be able to love and trust yourself before committing to any relationship, because it\u2019s the most important thing.\nAlso, you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to put yourself out there when it comes to relationships, because sometimes they turn out as we want and sometimes they don\u2019t. Either way, we learn from those bad experiences and we plan on how we can make them better the next time we decide to get back in the game. We then come back with more knowledge on what to look out for and what to do even better.\nBut hopefully your fear will go away when you find someone who you feel really comfortable around, who you trust, etc, and feels like your ultimate best friend.

Was this completely his idea? Is this something he really wanted to do? If this is the case and he made a mistake how was your nagging going to help? Nagging is not supporting someone who wants to make a change. It's like punishing the person for making the mistake.\nWhat I'm guessing is this is not the situation. I'm guessing you decided you didn't like him smoking and you want him to change his habit. I'm doubting you asked if he would consider it and accept his answer (especially if it was a no). I pressume you pressured him to make the promise not to smoke. Maybe you got overly emotional at him, maybe nagged, berated him with your concern. I'm guessing you kept the pressure on until you got your promise.\nWhen you pressure someone to make a promise this is not actually a promise. Just as if you pressure someone to say yes to something. This isn't consent. It is manipulation and controlling behaviour. The person gives in because in the moment it is easier to make the promise than deal with the argument. All you have done is worn the person down in which they will do anything to make it stop.\nThen when they change their mind, well actually being honest because they did not want to do what they said they would, you get upset and nag them.

It is your role to support him when he needs (and importantly asks for) help.\nWhat you should not do is nag your boyfriend in an attempt to have him fit your ideal boyfriend.

When one individual shares all types of emotions with the better half, it surely goes a long way to fine tune the relationship furthermore.\nWhen you talk about weakness, then weakness also is part of life and this cannot be restricted to Committed Longterm relationships between a man and woman. Weakness exists in every relationship as described in the first para of this answer. Every individual takes a calculated risk in life just to ensure that any negative effects if the decisions taken do not endanger the future of the entire family members!!! This calculated risk taking is a type of weakness. When you don't have a family, you have that capability to take as much risk as possible as it is only going to affect you and not beyond you. If your family stands through to your immense risk taking capability then this same weakness turns out to a strong point for you!!\nEither ways, even if you become weak at some point of time in life, the relationship is definitely going to be Healthy in the long run!!!\nThat is the reason people who are in a socially acceptable relationships, who have families are always ahead of others who are maintaining unconfirmed or illicit relationships. The risk of breakup, the feeling of insecurity is always there in relationships that are not Longterm, and hence, such relationships are weak and not at all healthy!!\nI hope to have tried my best to give you a suitable answer.\nGood luck!!", "It\u2019s a double edged sword.

If your partner is open minded about bettering their self and your relationship, you should consider recommending counseling to them, but ONLY if they are open minded!\nIf the partner has been known to be closed minded, mentioning counseling may cause an unintended emotional blowback. I would recommend avoiding ultimatums as well, as they tend to be catalysts for emotional explosions for people like that.\nThe only way to control what someone does to you is to not interact with that person.

One person talked about how they made one thing a day to look forward to. My husband had been sliding towards depression, and he laughed a lot for the first time in awhile.\nI think that\u2019s the answer: use what you have to keep that flame burning. Schedule skyping sessions, zooming times with groups of friends you have in common, or those that you planned to introduce him to. We scheduled dinner/lunch with my daughter who lives in England - we\u2019d hoped to visit her fairly soon but that\u2019s off. They ate dinner while we ate lunch, and it was good! I got to know her husband\u2019s sister a bit more - she\u2019s shy and quiet, so it\u2019ll take awhile. I got to see them as a family, which made me feel good about how they\u2019re doing, and I\u2019d been worried, deep down, in the pit of my stomach. I have faith in her, really, but it\u2019s a mom thing. You worry. It comes with the territory.\nSo, tl:dr\u2026 Use the good side of social networking to build that foundation, and not just one on one, but with all of your friends, your family, and your special person. Make it a point, a focus, go through the hassle, the emailing, the reminding. Clean off the table. Light some candles. Pour the wine, or the good seltzer and fancy juice combo. Comb your hair. Change your shirt. Take a little pride in your appearance for that hour or so. S/he/they are worth it. Show that to them. You\u2019ll make it ok. Really.
