But Dating isn‚Äôt marriage. Due to most people Date for marriage, in the west we are seen people confuse Dating to be same as marriage. Dating and marriage are 2 completely different things. Marriage is 2 people becoming Life Partner, Sexual Mate and a Couple till divorce. As for Dating. Dating for marriage is 2 people socialize a bit with romantic intent, to determine whether they want to be together. If the answer is yes, they become a Couple, if the answer is no, they separate. Dating for fun, is 2 people sexually interest in each other, start hanging out a bit. After a period of time, one of two things would happen, (A) They like each other so much and felt they are compatible and become a Couple, this is what is usually refer to as ‚Äúcasual relationship turn serious‚Äù or (B) after having a bit of fun, the relationship end. But sometime it doesn‚Äôt end on good term. This usually happen when, one party confuse Dating to be same as marriage. So, for example when both party know it is a casual thing, it is unlikely a girl would complain about a guy dumping her after the sex and likely the guy won‚Äôt care too much about the girl dating another guy, without telling him. If one party is dating for fun and other is dating for marriage, it depends. If the party dating for marriage, isn‚Äôt the type that confuse dating to be same as marriage, this is less likely to be the problem and the girl most likely won‚Äôt sleep with the guy, till they are a Couple and guy probably won‚Äôt care too much about her dating other guys, he probably be seen other girls also. (But that is providing if both parties are reasonable people) and then there are those that confuse dating to be same as marriage, this is where we start seen girls saying ‚Äúhe is treating a woman like crap for dumping him after the sex‚Äù and guys accusing their girlfriend of Cheating, for seen other guys. Because, none of those things are OK, within a Spouse relationship. And if 2 people has become a Couple, dumping a girl after the sex, that is simply not cool. Usually in abusive relationship, the abuser want the relationship to move forward and become serious, exclusive and committed very quickly, due to it help to entrap the girl within a commitment. Most abuser, got very little to loose due to such commitment, because most abusers are narcissist beta male thugs. Narcissist got strong desire for admiration, if he is an alpha male he be the type of boyfriend that sleep with all your friends. But if he is a beta male, he can‚Äôt get girls, but as a thug, he care not who he hurt getting what he wants.

If you haven‚Äôt healed or had enough distance from the apex of toxicity- then the freshness of the feelings can spoil any potential to resolve the relationship.\nEnd it if one person is pulling all the weight. Healing a relationship needs to be mutual. It cannot be one sided. This just generates new layers of toxicity.\nThere is more negative than positive.\nThere are not consistent signs that give you hope/optimism about the relationship. Rebuilding trust and health in a relationship takes a LOT of effort. There needs to be patience and understanding that healing toxicity is not an immediate of quick process. So there needs to be daily investment, and clear sings that both parties are working towards something better.\nThe goals are vague. You need to decide what a healthy relationship looks like, and be very specific about what dynamics need to change. If you‚Äôre at 0 (toxic), and want to get to 100 (healthy), then that‚Äôs awesome. But define what that ‚Äú100‚Äù looks like, otherwise making progress towards a 5 might be taken as evidence that the work is done. And it‚Äôs not. 5 is still toxic if 100 is healthy. So celebrate the baby steps, but don‚Äôt mistake a moderately less toxic relationship as a healthy one.\nYou need to be on the same page about what needs to change- both in terms of the dynamic, and how you interact. If one person is stubborn and identifies with their toxic traits- then healing isn‚Äôt going to happen. Toxic traits emerge from experience, and they are usually protective mechanisms. So it takes a lot of inner work and healing to resolve. Patience is needed, but the desire to overcome those traits is also needed. If someone doesn‚Äôt want to heal- they just want you to accept their toxicity- this is a losing battle.\nIf one partner refuses to take responsibility for contributing or enabling the toxicity. It may be the case that one party feels like the victim. And they may have been victimized. But what needs to change on their end- is to stand up for themselves. To enforce their boundaries. To handle conflict better without submitting. And to not stay attached to the victim identity as a way to gain power through guilting their partner.

I know he‚Äôs mine and he knows I‚Äôm his. Trust plays a huge factor in this, and this is something I‚Äôve seen many ladies especially (not always, but normally it‚Äôs the gals) get upset about. Of course I would imagine that the wife or girlfriend looks at the Insta model and immediately feels threatened, and/or thinks her man is getting off to her pics or sexually fantasizing about her.\nIt may seem kinda weird, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm gonna get the, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a female!‚Äù response, but I deal with many, MANY jacked, ripped dudes on a daily basis (not that my hubby isn‚Äôt one sexy jacked mofo ;) ), but I have NEVER thought anything more about ANY of them other than, ‚ÄúDude, you‚Äôve worked your ass off and you look great. Fucking congrats man.‚Äù There‚Äôs no sexual fantasy, no further mind play. IMO there‚Äôs a huge difference in being able to admire someone‚Äôs physique, and sexually fantasizing about them. I‚Äôm not sure what your personal reasons are for wanting to follow these ladies, but if you find yourself with more sexual thoughts than thoughts of general ‚Äòdamn she is hot, how can a body be so nice, wow she‚Äôs worked her ass off,‚Äô then maybe you need to sit and re-evaluate a few things, especially if you‚Äôre in a committed relationship with a gal who you KNOW would be put-off by the simple act of you following this other gal.\nHowever it really depends on the couple. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve sent my husband a photo of some other insta model‚Äôs boobs/body and been like, ‚ÄúDude, THAT is nice.‚Äù (I‚Äôm 100% straight, just in case you were also wondering). It‚Äôs often that I‚Äôm showing HIM photos of other chicks that I think are just gorgeous. I very much appreciate the beauty of the physique and often look at photos of others in near nude garb, and there‚Äôs never an inkling of a sexual thought. But I also do realize that my marriage might be a bit of a rarity for a few reasons- first is that I‚Äôve busted me ASS to attain a sexy physique. I KNOW I look good (please spare the comments- I‚Äôm not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, nor do I pretend to be, and that‚Äôs fine. But I knew what I wanted and I have worked for the last 7 years to try to make it a reality). My confidence is probably higher than the average. Couple that with the fact that I TRUST MY HUSBAND WITH MY LIFE, and boom ‚Äî instant recipe for ‚ÄòHey babe check out this chicks boobs!‚Äô (Not trying to be vulgar- that REALLY happens here in this house! Lol). Don‚Äôt really need to say more about that. But if these factors are lacking, then issues in the relationship may arise, and I would speculate that they would revolve primarily around both insecurity and trust (or lack of trust).\nSome individuals are just wired in a way that would never allow for them to be comfortable with it. I have a friend who has flat out told me, ‚ÄúHailey, I just could never do what you do, no offense, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine ever being okay with her (girlfriend) following a bunch of other shirtless dudes‚Äù (my friend is a guy). So there really are many factors to consider, and this whole, ‚ÄúShould I follow that sexy Insta model‚Äù really is up to what you and your partner deem acceptable. I would definitely suggest bringing it up and discussing it with them. Elaborate as to what your intentions are in following the people that you want to follow, and ask them if they have any issues with it.\nTHAT IS THE SHORT VERSION. BUT I would like to add some input on my mental progression with confidence and self-esteem issues as the years have progressed and my physique has continued to improve. I will elaborate on both my prior outlook as the insecure girlfriend, as well as my current outlook.\nAgain, I realize my physique isn‚Äôt the cats meow for everyone; I did what I needed to do to attain MY version of the ideal female physique (and I‚Äôm still working on it!). It has ALWAYS been about getting to that point where I‚Äôm satisfied with my physique (I‚Äôm not there and honestly don‚Äôt think it will ever come), BUT this question had me stop and rewind time 7 years - back before any of my lifting endeavors. Back when my physique was nothing more than that of the ‚Äòstraight up and down‚Äô of a boy‚Äôs body. Back when my confidence was buried under the baggy clothes that worked so well to hide the shame I harbored for my body. Of course, 7 years of time has allowed me to grow into a much more mentally secure person (in general), but I can‚Äôt deny that I would have felt vulnerable and threatened if my then-boyfriend 7 years ago would have shown me a photo of some curvy, gorgeous Insta model. It‚Äôs true. But it‚Äôs quite interesting to analyze how I‚ÄôM now the one showing my husband photos of these other ladies.\nI‚Äôve never been one who has an easy time holding her tongue. The older I get, the more prone I am to dispensing that stone cold, seemingly heartless line of truth that everyone is thinking but no one else will dare utter. When the idiot spouts off at the mouth, I‚Äôm generally the one in the room who will be the first to pipe up. I find this quality exacerbating as the years progress, and I must add that I feel a bit‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ bitter towards most. The reasons are quite numerous, honestly, but there‚Äôs one I particular reason that is quite fitting for this discussion. Please pardon me, as this is really turning into a lengthy piece.\nTwo quotes have stuck with me throughout the entirety of my life, and one of them is the following, ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as an ugly woman; just a lazy, uninformed one.‚Äù Now please, I KNOW my faults, and my imperfections are too numerous to count. I don‚Äôt want to give the impression that I‚Äôm rooting my own horn, but holy shit have I put in my time. While in college I scouted for and found a job that would allow me to work minimal hours for maximal dough (a high-school sports photography job). Time was a precious resource for me and every extra hour I had was dedicated to reading. Reading and reading and reading and READING. The journal articles, the pubmed studies, the blog posts by the experts in the field - I was OBSESSED, and was often locked away in the room I rented for 300 bucks (bills included ;) ). I knew what I wanted my physique to look like, and I knew that I knew that I had to put in my time in the books to make my time in the gym the most efficient as possible.\nI was OBSESSED. I knew what I wanted and did what I had to do to make things work. There was no time for the whole pity party of ‚Äòpoor me I‚Äôm so insecure and self-conscious.‚Äô My schedule included classes and work, but I MADE time. How? I scouted for a job that paid me $100 per hour. I rented a room from a lady for $300 per month, and often cleaned the rest of her home (and her car and her mother‚Äôs home) for deductions in my rent. Often times I was paying $150‚Äì$200 in rent, with a total of $400-$600 in expenses per month. Of course this meant that my monthly expenses were paid for by working just a measly 4‚Äì6 hours a week. I drove a ‚Äò99 Camry so gas was cheap. My only other expense was car insurance. I cut out every other unnecessary expense. Those were the days of using email and facebook to contact people (mooching off free WiFi) since I refused to pay for monthly cell service. My splurging was spending 20 bucks at the local thrift store for a few new shirts, and maybe 5 bucks at a local bakery on Sunday. Sales at the grocery store were my go-to, to the point of even asking if they would just give me their old ‚Äòno good‚Äô throw away veggies (they couldn‚Äôt due to legal reasons. I then countered and said I‚Äôll sign any liability waiver‚Ä¶ nope üòï lol). I ate the cactus out of my own backyard to save money. I fucking MADE IT WORK. I MADE time for my schooling, my studies (studies meaning gym-related studies), as well as the actual lifting. It has been a long 7 years, but I have scrapped and scrounged every minute to be able to change my life and attain the things I want most.\nI used to be that self-conscious girl. Sure, I still have my moments, and there are some things that can‚Äôt be changed no matter how much work we invest. BUT there‚Äôs a great deal that we CAN do. You DO have the time- you just aren‚Äôt hungry enough to MAKE the time. You AREN‚ÄôT HUNGRY ENOUGH to make it work, and you aren‚Äôt willing to do whatever is within your control to change your life- and potentially your outlook.\nMy experiences have definitely given me a new perspective to this whole ‚Äòself esteem‚Äô issue. I‚Äôve had other trainers comment and tell me that women they‚Äôve worked with have done complete mental 180 (with regards to self-esteem) as they‚Äôve trained into a physique they‚Äôre now satisfied with. Many ladies (and men also, of course) are quick to sit back and get upset that some of these models even exist, but they won‚Äôt lift one finger to change a thing about themselves or their situation. Many times, their only issue with you looking at photos of other women is their own insecurity. Yet instead of stepping up and trying to better themselves, they'll forever sit in their slump and place restrictions on YOU. Again, there are certainly those individuals who have other issues with the issue of the question asked- issues that have nothing to do with insecurity/self esteem, and that‚Äôs understandable. But many, MANY ladies (and men!) are quick to shackle you and forever leave it at that because they‚Äôre absolutely unwilling to step up to the plate to try to better themselves.\nSure, one day I‚Äôll be old and withered ‚Äî that‚Äôs life. But I‚Äôll also be old and withered right next to the individual who I trust with my life and I know will stick with me through anything. I‚Äôll probably miss my tight physique when I‚Äôm 90, and will look back at how my glutes were as shapely as they were, how my ab and forearm veins would always make their appearance. I‚Äôll probably be old and sad about the fact that the things I once worked so hard for have withered away in what seemed like a blink of the eye. Hell, I‚Äôll probably even be a little jelly when a gorgeous 30 year old woman saunters by me (BUT I WILL STILL LOOK LOL). But I‚Äôll remember that some things, like getting old, are inevitable. Not a thing can be done about it.

Or i think they're married already, I'll have to confirm.\nWhat happened in my case: I had hardly spent any time with my partner as she left for medical college in abroad. The only awkward thing that kept our desperation going, was the conversation between us. Later it didn't work out for us because my work was impacted and our families didn't support our relationship etc.\nMy friend had ample time to spend with her lady. Her families supported them and they could withstand the long distance relationship, for over 5 years (the guy is in usa and the lady is in india). This could happen because they had spent some time already and this i believe helped them to get through the distance constraint.\nI was a non believer that long distance relationship works. But after seeing my idiot friend and his fair lady, i am thinking that they did it right. I used to ask my fried whether he had any affairs during all this time. He said it never happened to him. So therefore, the qualities you have in a person matters too. Personally, i never tried to look for an affair until much later in my long distance relationship. The reason for that could be that I was more unhappy and desparate about my long-distance relationship rather than being happy about it (there was nothing to feel happy about, i had to struggle daily just to keep someone happy on a different time zone, Obviously it couldn't have lasted for long..) So, do it right and make it a point to spend time with each other (physical presence, not digital) whenever the distancing gets to you and makes you feel insecure.\nI wish you luck, friend.

Sad, but unfortunate, I believe people have no alternative but to finally acknowledge and deal with the fact that they are with a narc.\nAs predictable as a narc is with their behavior and treatment of others, it is easy to ignore and make excuses for them, when you are not around them as much. Schools are closed, workers are at home, children cannot attend daycare, no restaurants, no bar scene, stay-at-home orders, hence, the days become very long, when one cannot move around from place to place. This movement is a necessity for a narc to get supply and feed their never-ending self-indulgences. When the world is forced to stop and remain in one place, this is extremely stressful for the narc. Narcs need variety and constant supply - from the waiter to the gas station attendant to their partner - in order to ensure they are recognized, adored and worthy. When the narc‚Äôs supply is limited or depleted, they cannot handle this. They have very low self-esteem and a very low opinion of themselves, that‚Äôs why they wear a mask and mirror their primary supply.\nWith limited interactions, the narc cannot successfully and continually wear their masks and it begins to slip off. As the mask slips, the true character of the narc begins to show. Compare the narc‚Äôs behavior to a feral animal. As long as the animal can find food, shelter and wander freely, it is fine. Put the animal in a box and it becomes uncontrollable and irate. The narc, in essence, is in a box (stay-at-home order). Now the narc must adhere to a boundary or a rule.\nNow look at the audience (spouse, kids for example), they are forced to share the same environment with the narc during this time. The shared space will quickly become unbearable because the narc has no tolerance for boundaries. The audience is now forced to deal with the narc‚Äôs behavior, whereas before, they didn‚Äôt have to since the narc had the freedom to wander round. The mask has slipped and the only thing the audience can do is deal with the unbearable situation as best as they can.', 'upvote': 3}}, 'create_time': 'Apr 2, 2020'}, '145': {'question_title': 'How long did you wait before you got with your significant other?', 'question_author': 'Jay Harewood', 'topic_list': [], 'answer_count': 5, 'no_of_view': '1,139', 'no_of_follower': 2, 'respond': {'2': {'user_name': 'Linda Culp', 'date': 'Apr 16, 2020', 'view': 46, 'answer': 'I was 53 by the time I finally met my boyfriend.\nOf all the men that I met and dated before him, none of them were able to meet me on my level and treat me right.\nHe is not only head and shoulders above everyone from my past, he makes me truly happy in many ways.

But the main advice is, you have to disentangle yourself from this toxic person. It‚Äôs going to hurt, but it‚Äôs going to hurt a lot more if you keep her in your life.\nFirst, the legal problems. Was the marriage legally recognized, by a marriage certificate or equivalent? The law doesn‚Äôt care if the marriage was secret or not. If you do have a legally valid marriage, you should legally divorce, because otherwise you are still entangled with this person. Depending on local laws, you might not be able to date other people without being accused of adultery, which means you might end up having to pay your ex a lot of money. So, I‚Äôd start there. If it wasn‚Äôt a legally-recognized marriage (but was recognized by the Hindu faith as being valid), then I‚Äôm not sure what you have to do, as I don‚Äôt know what the rules are concerning divorce in that faith.\nSecond, interpersonal: basically, you should break off contact, and look for somebody else (after taking care of any legal/cultural prohibitions against seeing someone else). Getting dumped really sucks, I‚Äôve been there. But there are other people out there. You just have to move on.\nThird, cultural: are other people going to look down on you because you are in this situation? Here I‚Äôm not so sure what to say, because I admit I‚Äôm not really familiar with your culture. But I will say, if you think that you have an accurate analysis of the situation, trust that analysis, even if you are being pressured to see things differently. Again, hard to do, but you have to trust the fact that your family, friends, or priest will not be in possession of as many facts as you are. They won‚Äôt know what that relationship was really like.

I think in times like this, especially if either one of your main love languages is Touch, then it is key to try to top up your 2nd love language in whatever way you can. People feel loved in different ways, and not hitting the right one feels just like buying a washing machine for your wife on v-day (okay, not the best of example cause some would really love that, but you get the idea).\nKnow that love is a choice, not a feeling. - You‚Äôd be surprise but yes, love is not a feeling. Ask any married couple who have been together for years and they will tell you that there are many times when they felt irritated by their partners, etc, but it‚Äôs the choice to love regardless. Feelings do make it easier, but the key essence is still a choice. There is this joke I‚Äôve heard, ‚ÄúA boyfriend is someone who irritates you 90% of the time, but also loves you 10% of the time in a way that makes you forget that 90%.‚Äù\nLove is also spelt T-I-M-E. - Take time to invest in each other‚Äôs lives, whether be it to FaceTime each other, or just have a morning / goodnight call here and there. If you both have decided to choose each other, then make the effort to be there for each other (even if it has to be over video rather than in person). Just like a child who will eventually grow closer to the parent who invested more time in their life, the same applies to our partners.\nConsistency over intensity. - We have always favoured intensity over consistency. Just like how we wait till the end of the season to binge watch a TV show over the weekend; or we do crash diets and hope that it will be successful. However, what really works and lasts is consistency, never intensity. Working out 14 hours at one go is never going to work as well as 30 mins a day over a month. Going to the dentist once every 6 months is never going to be as effective as that 3 mins of brushing your teeth twice daily. The same goes with your relationship. It wasn‚Äôt because you pursued your partner over the weekend (or the other way round if you are on the receiving end) constantly that got you both together. It‚Äôs all the little things that you both did for or together (e.g. you saw a movie and wanted to watch it together; he/she wanted to get some groceries and got something for you; etc) that made both of you realise one day that, ‚ÄúHey, I love this person.‚Äù\nI know that it all seems like a lot of things to remember or even do, and this might be a monkey wrench into what I shared but‚Ä¶ know that there is no formulae to relationships. What works for one, doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it will work for another.

It has a deep and an important meaning to everything you do in a relationship. Any relation can‚Äôt work efficiently if it lacks trust. Relationships are about exposing yourself to risks that other people can impose on.\nFor example: When you get into a Uber, you trust your cab driver to get you to the destination and to only cheat you a little bit.\nYou trust the worker behind the Glass-window on Subway, not to spit in your sandwich..\nTrust is fundamental to our existence.

Remember on how happy a relationship would be if you can be yourself, showing your unique, bad and good sides.\nOn the end note; Wanting to fulfill your partner and becoming irreplaceable is something we all strive for, wether you believe it or not, but being irreplaceable is nothing without a strong relationship.

I just am, and nobody seems to understand that. ‚Äú\n‚ÄúAnxiety happens when you think you have to figure out everything at once. Breathe. You're strong. You got this. Take it day by day.‚Äù\n‚ÄúFeeling anxious? Be mindful of where your thoughts are going. Stop replaying troubling memories from the past. Stop obsessing about the future. Breathe. Be present. Then think of one thought or habit you can do to feel better right here in this moment.‚Äù\n‚ÄúToday I will not stress over things I cannot control.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhen you're feeling anxious, remember that you're still you. You are not your anxiety. ‚Äú\n‚ÄúYou wouldn't worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI hold onto the Scripture that says, ‚ÄúBe anxious for nothing, but in all things give thanks.‚Äù I'm not saying I don't have problems or that I don't worry, but I try not to be stressed. I manage my anxiety through prayer. Worry shows up on your face, and I don't want that.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou are strong for getting out of bed in the morning when it feels like hell. You are brave for doing things even though they scare you and make you anxious. And you are amazing for trying and holding on no matter how hard life gets.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnxiety makes you worry about tomorrow, but really all you can control is right now.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another. ‚Äú\n‚ÄúDo not believe the things you tell yourself when you are sad and alone.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou're not going to master the rest of your life in one day. Just relax. Master the day. Then keep doing that every day.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou might feel anxious right now, but that means you're still alive and kicking.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnxiety is one little tree in your forest.

In short the answer is there is a tremendous amount of selfish and self-centered behavior that results form addiction. How to get it. How to not run out. How to hold withdrawal at bay.\nThese are all very time consuming endeavors. It leaves little time for concern for others. That isn‚Äôt to imply addicts don‚Äôt love others - they do! And, when they promise to discontinue use because the harm that they are doing others is genuine and sincere, in the moment it is made. But that moment is short lived because of the compulsion to return to using.\nFor the spouse or relation of an addict they are left confused by promises and repeated conversations that result in a return to using only shortly after extracting those promises.\nBecause true love and commitment to another as in a marriage requires a tremendous amount of compromise and consideration of the other persons needs, this makes the addict/alcoholic while in active use a poor selection for that type of relationship. In order to have a successful marriage/relationship you‚Äôd have to have the ability to put the other persons needs before your own ‚Äúon occasion‚Äù. Without the ability to do this the other partner is often left feeling like they are always making concessions, excuses and ultimately capitulation to the other person and their disease of addiction. It results in anger, resentment, passive aggressive or outright aggressive behavior which eminmates from an extreme sense of frustration and helplessness.\nThere are programs such as Al-Anon or Nar-Anon, counseling, community resources etc. to assist the spouse/partner of an addict. These are advisable. The partner of an addict/alcoholic might often wonder why ‚Äúthey‚Äù need assistance or a program if the ‚Äúother‚Äù person is the one with the problem. The challenge here is that addiction is insidious, an all encompassing. It has the power to swallow a family whole and keep going. To the co-sufferer of someone with addiction, you‚Äôll know that last statement is not hyperbole. Therefore if the addict is incapable of admitting there‚Äôs a problem and seeking assistance, it‚Äôs good for someone/anyone in the family to acknowledge the problem is likely larger than extracting a true promise of abstinence/reduction from the afflicted and seek outside help.\nAt these programs the spouse/partner of an addict will learn what things, comments, actions that they may be taking that aren‚Äôt only not helpful but may be exacerbating the circumstances. They learn about how actions, sometimes referred to as ‚Äúenabling‚Äù are actually prolonging the addiction. This is done with an inadvertent misunderstanding of addiction and how powerful it is.\nI wish you and your family all the hope of finding a solution to a family problem.

I think my worst relationship trait is an unwillingness to ‚Äúwork things out.‚Äú\nThis might come across as an inability to communicate feelings. And there's some truth to that. But I think another part of it is that I just don't think talking about relationships do anything. I think it's a form of accepting people as they are.\nSo like maybe something will bother me for some weeks or even months. But I don't make relationship decisions quickly once I decide to enter into one at all. So I'm making observations and subconsciously trying to establish a pattern of behavior. And when I decide that there is a pattern, I accept it and decide to terminate the relationship.\nThis might come as a surprise to the other person because I hadn't complained about anything, though some feelers will notice something is off before it happens.\nSo it's not just that I can't express emotions. It's also that I avoid the emotional difficulty of communicating because the cost-benefit analysis doesn't work out for me ‚Äî because people don't really change.\nAnother complication of this trait is that once committed in a relationship, I tolerate bad behavior for a really long time. Again, because I don't think the other person will change, whatever I say. It's a negative form of accepting others.\nI've also been very skeptical of couples and family counseling because there isn't empirical data to show it works. And wouldn't I know myself and my relationship with someone else better than any third party could? So that's another reason to remain stubborn, which might be very irritating in modern therapy culture.\nA more minor point is my unwillingness to REALLY feel things. I used to think it was just because I hadn't met the right person or I haven't allowed myself to be vulnerable.\nBut I think a good deal of it is that emotional highs and lows just don't feel comfortable to me.

The first month was great. Great sex, lots of attention, and I felt great! Then I found out she was making other guys feel the same.\nIn another instance, I was single and pursued another woman I felt was quite attractive. Well she was very attractive, but didn‚Äôt have a great personality. We often clashed. We barely began dating before I got sick of her.\nWhile in another relationship, a woman who I deemed to be a bit less attractive than my current partner caught my attention. We met as friends, joked about hooking up and having wild sex adventures. Let‚Äôs call her Linda. After having a meaningless argument with my then girlfriend, I left and ran to Linda. We had wild sex, but it wasn‚Äôt long before we realized that our sexual desires were incompatible. Or rather to be clear, I didn‚Äôt want phallic objects inserted into my anal cavity.\nLast but not least, while single yet again and on a dating sight, I connected with a VERY VERY attractive woman. She was an actual model. I didn‚Äôt think it would go anyway, but shot my shot anyway and it worked! The problem there was she was frequently traveling, so I wouldn‚Äôt see her very often. She also traveled with her male best friend who was also a model ‚Äî really cool guy. I later found out that she did not cook what so ever, so anything she ate was cooked for her or she ordered. She was also the type to run away from conflict, so when we had a disagreement, she‚Äôs change the subject and run away. But the straw that broke the camels back was when I was hanging out with her male best friend one day. In the midst of hanging out, he bent over to get something and his boxers caught my attention. Jokingly I said ‚ÄúThose boxers must be popular, Gina wears that same brand from time to time.‚Äù He laughed and said ‚Äúshe needs to stop stealing them from me.‚Äù. Ummm what?!\nLong story short, she‚Äôd frequently wear her male best friend‚Äôs boxers and shirts, especially to sleep in. When she told me she had feelings for him but he would never act, I took my leave.\nMoral of these stories, the grass is not always greener on the other side. You‚Äôve put in the time and effort to get to know your current partner. You know many of their likes and dislikes, you know mostly how they think and how they‚Äôd react, and you‚Äôve worked to build a foundation. Why trash all that to try your luck with someone you know nothing about except that they‚Äôre attractive?\nHear me out. It‚Äôs like playing BINGO and having 4 spaces filled with 1 to go to make a straight and completely line, then throwing your BINGO card away to obtain a new card to start again from scratch.

Empathize with the reader.\nDo your best to understand the other person‚Äôs side. What might they have felt to behave that way? What untold struggles have they been facing?\nBy bringing this up, you‚Äôll make the other person feel important and you‚Äôll both find common ground.\n3. Share support\nYou should say what you expect from this relationship in terms of behavior and support. What can you do to help each other? Are your goals aligned?\nIf you follow these 3 steps, you‚Äôll set a neutral environment to address the issue and the reader will most likely become less defensive.\nHowever, lasting relationships are not only about resolving conflict but also about nurturing.\nSo let me show you how to write a letter to express gratitude and appreciation.\nPaint the scenario\nFirst of all, you should write an introduction to grab the reader‚Äôs attention and make him or her want to read the letter.\nHere you‚Äôll write something that you know the person would agree with you, whether it is a background story about what you‚Äôve been through together or a fun fact about your relationship. But the reader has to think ‚ÄúOh yeah, that‚Äôs true!‚Äù\n2. Say what you admire about the other person.\nThis is a good exercise even to you because by thinking about the other person‚Äôs traits, you might notice some good attributes that you haven‚Äôt noticed before.\n3. Specific appreciation.\nThis step works wonders because now you get the chance to show the reader how much you care and notice about him or her. Describing deeply why you‚Äôre thankful for what they‚Äôve been doing is an excellent way to strengthen bonds between you two.\nWe know that perfect relationships are an illusion and we should never set unrealistic expectations for ourselves nor for others.

Most of the times a relationship is ruined due to trust issues that creep up due to the distance. Both of you should trust each other and also should learn to give each other the required space. If either person gets worried or jealous do not get angry. On the contrary think that you are blessed with a person who does not see anything else except you.\nBe Loyal - There are many things which we can do when we are away from our loved ones but a broken trust is just like a string which is broken from between. Once broken, it can be joined again but there will be a knot in between life long which cannot be removed.\nGive Each Other time - There may be time differences, there may be work hour differences but make sure either of you give each other ample time and hear out each other about your daily activity. In this way by talking to each other and giving time to each other will make you feel that though there is a physical distance between you two, but your presence is always there with your partner\nLove Truly - Last but not the least.

I have a very big fight with my Ex and after sometime, I realized that even though I was correct, I had been too harsh and ended up hurting her. Yes for me it would have been really easy to say sorry. But I told her to give me 48 hours and then 2 hours on the 3rd day.

Obviously there will people who claim to have a sex life when they are 75 but they are the exception or lying. Life typically goes as follows; boy and girl meet, fall in love, get engaged and get married, and by the 1980s most girls were not virgins like me but it was something their mums always wished for. Forgetting any pre marital sex, after the wedding and now hopefully living in their own home, the average couple would really have the best sex of their lives. With just the two of you, sex could be without inhibition, more or less when you wanted it and were you wanted it; I think we did it in every room, the stairs and the car. The stockings and suspenders and brief knickers, the role plays, the spanking, the running naked around the house all remind me of getting dripping wet, with the expectation. You could dress up, go out clubbing, go for a meal and come home with no knickers and make some noise and scream at orgasm.The absolute best time for this period is in your 20s, as you have the energy. So this regular sex carries on for an average of seven years, which is the time couples may be struggling to get their own home, and build a work career. This can put pressure on the relationship for couples now in their early thirties. Sex is less regular due to external pressure of work but in some respects can be due to the ‚Äò been there done that feeling‚Äò of boredom in the bedroom. Sex becomes routine, and is a struggle to keep regular. It might vary from being a job of work, to still being passionate but just a little less often. Sadly, the marriage can either end here with the seven year itch, as either party goes off with a younger person, or the real love and affection comes out and the couple recognise that they should have the children they want some day. While the sex will never be the same as the 'dripping wet‚Äô orgasmic fun it used to be, the couple who stay together now replace a certain amount of passion for monthly charts and thermometers and him having to have lots of sex either side of ovulation day! The children are born which gives the couple a new purpose in life and this hopefully carries on until their are brothers and sisters to care for. While kids are small and in bed there is some time for some sex but not anything too wild, so as not to wake the kids. Once the kids grow and start to question things and by the time they are teenage, its nearly impossible for mum and dad to get it together, and extremely embarrassing for the kids to listen through the walls as mum starts to make some noise on orgasm. About this time in the marriage, medical matters conspire to reduce the sex, such being overweight or arthritis, or the need for viagra, or the need for a hysterectomy, so sex is almost dead, and the marriage continues in for the companionship and the support they give as grandparents. This might seem a sorry tail and give a depressing outlook for the future but sadly it is very nearly the same for everyone. Incidentally it annoys me when they interview a couple who have been married 70 years who say they have never had a disagreement. They have had a marriage based on one party rule and no dissension in the ranks!

Well I know that there is a ballet or opera coming up she wants to attend but I don't because I think its boring but i need to think of her interest and needs and do the things she wants in order to get her to mutually meet my needs and interest. That is what I mean by a compromise, by not being selfish or self centered. I never compromise on a conflict or argument, especially if it means my morals or values are at stake. I Don't care how much it pisses off my wife. What I will do is listen carefully to what she says, get her opinion on the matter and offer my opinion. Of course sometimes its impossible to work out a solution but we at least try to work out something. It sounds like every time you have an argument its with someone who doesn't listen to or value your opinion so I'm guessing by compromise you mean the conflict altogether never gets resolved and you never really get your point across so you end up dropping the issue.

One person talked about how they made one thing a day to look forward to. My husband had been sliding towards depression, and he laughed a lot for the first time in awhile.\nI think that‚Äôs the answer: use what you have to keep that flame burning. Schedule skyping sessions, zooming times with groups of friends you have in common, or those that you planned to introduce him to. We scheduled dinner/lunch with my daughter who lives in England - we‚Äôd hoped to visit her fairly soon but that‚Äôs off. They ate dinner while we ate lunch, and it was good! I got to know her husband‚Äôs sister a bit more - she‚Äôs shy and quiet, so it‚Äôll take awhile.

You worry. It comes with the territory.\nSo, tl:dr‚Ä¶ Use the good side of social networking to build that foundation, and not just one on one, but with all of your friends, your family, and your special person. Make it a point, a focus, go through the hassle, the emailing, the reminding. Clean off the table. Light some candles. Pour the wine, or the good seltzer and fancy juice combo. Comb your hair. Change your shirt. Take a little pride in your appearance for that hour or so. S/he/they are worth it. Show that to them. You‚Äôll make it ok. Really.

Falling in love is easy to do, almost effortless, but losing that loving feeling is not that hard to do, either.\nOf course, when a relationship is new, it is fun and enjoyable courting or being courted. In the beginning, we are constantly thinking about the new person in our life, and wanting to spend all of our time together and share new experiences together. We want to show how we feel by getting cards or flowers or just sending a cute text message.\nFeelings, however, can be fleeting. No one seems to want to talk about how those loving feelings can fade, that it takes work to keep the love alive, and that choosing to stay in love is a choice we all must make.Who we love is as much of a choice as it is a feeling. Staying in love takes a commitment. After the rosy glow of the new relationship wears off, we have to make a decision: Do we want to love this person and commit to a relationship together, or are we going to let this person go? Once we have made the decision that we have found the person we want to be with and commit to, then the work begins.\nA big part of that work is making many other choices. It is a choice to see the good in our partner every day, rather than focusing on the negative things that bother us. We have to accept them and love them as they are. If we go into a relationship thinking we can change someone, we are setting our relationship and ourselves up to fail. We all have flaws and quirks and are weird in some ways. Accepting those differences is part of love. We can choose to ignore the petty, irritating small things our partner may do. If our partner forgets to take out the garbage, or leaves the cap off the toothpaste, we can talk about it with them, but we also can accept that this just might be forgetful, and choose to move on.\nTrying to change our partner into us is one of the biggest relationship mistakes we can make. When we are unhappy with how things are in our relationship, it is easy to overfocus on what we are not getting from the relationship. Instead, a healthier response is to see what we could be doing for our partner, rather than focusing on what they are not doing for us. We should always try to be supportive of our partner, because we cannot expect anything from our partner that we are not willing to give ourselves.\nAnother important choice we can make is to choose to remember the reasons why we committed to this person. Our relationship will not always be pleasant and there will be times for serious discussions and disagreement. There will be trying times and even bad times that we will need to work through together. The key to surviving these times is to remember to be respectful, acknowledge our commitment, and work through whatever is at hand together. During these times it really helps to remind ourselves of why we chose to love them in the first place.\nLove is all about choices. We choose to see the good, ignore the petty, look for what we could do for our partner, and remember why we love our partner. Choosing to put in the effort to do these things is what love looks like, and with that work comes the wonderful reward of staying in love.', 'upvote': 15}, '6': {'user_name': 'Denny McLeod', 'date': 'Apr 16, 2020', 'view': 94, 'answer': 'Generally speaking, females use sex to gain Love.

The topics chosen to qualify the question are quite broad.\nIn logic, an argument is a function, it doesn‚Äôt serve a function. Anyone who does any basic program will easily understand this. You will give your program a number of cases, and when those cases are satisfied, you will tell it to do such and such. That is a function in the form of a logical argument. In logic, we define a valid argument very precisely as a structure whereby, if the premises are true, the conclusion cannot be false. This is not the same meaning as when you might use the term ‚Äúargument‚Äù in other contexts.\nIn debate, ‚Äúargument‚Äù might be ambiguous between a disagreement or the different positions taken by the debaters, or it could refer to the logical definition of ‚Äúargument‚Äù as in specific arguments given for their positions which can be analyzed for their validity and soundness. I suppose in this sense the point, or function, of either sense of argument is an attempt to get closer to the truth, or at least better clarify positions on a topic.\nIn the most common sense, let‚Äôs call it the domestic sense, ‚Äúargument‚Äù could refer to any verbal fight, dispute, or disagreement between two or more people. In this sense, I always recall that two headed creature from the children‚Äôs program Sesame Street. The one head only says ‚ÄúYup yup yup yup..‚Äù, and the other responds, ‚Äúnope nope nope nope nope nope.‚Äù And it goes on and on like that. That kind of argument is obviously unproductive. But what makes it such?\nIn the first logical case where the argument is the function, it is doing something for us, namely whatever we have constructed it to do. It produces some desired result. In the debate sense, the desired result is a little more abstract. We have to refer to very general things like ‚Äúgetting closer to the truth‚Äù or ‚Äúclarifying our positions‚Äù. The debate serves its function in as much as we feel it has achieved these more general abstract purposes. I may have underplayed a purpose in the domestic sense, or lessened it by poking some fun at it.\nIn reality, common domestic disputes may have the same general purposes as a debate. But that really depends on the persons involved, and what they want to get out of it, and whether they want to get the same thing from it. If the one person has the sole purpose of clarifying contrary positions on a topic, and the other genuinely wants to get closer to the truth, the first person is going to really annoy and frustrate the second. It‚Äôs going to appear that they are merely playing devil‚Äôs advocate, and not genuinely attempting to find a common resolution. Just as in a piece of code, or even in a formal debate, those arguing in a domestic dispute ought to first decide their purpose, and agree on a desired outcome. Obviously that is very difficult to do in the course of life since these disagreements can seemingly erupt almost spontaneously out of raw emotions and not decidedly well formed logical propositions.

We won‚Äôt take for granted our connections any longer. We will treat, behave and speak to our connections as though we are no longer promised another tomorrow.\nWe will live our lives more mindfully. We will learn to fully embrace our feelings in general. We will experience joy and pleasure with new eyes. We will experience loss and grief with new eyes. We will taste our food completely. We will feel each sensation and emotion and we will savor.\nThis disease may very well lead the masses to a new mindset regarding tolerance. We live in an extremely diverse yet very intolerant world. Yet when one cannot breathe, we are all alike. We are all the same. We are all human beings. We may become more empathetic as a society.\nWe will learn to appreciate our senses. Touch, taste, smell, sight and hearing. Each experience we have will have meaning and won‚Äôt be taken for granted.\nWe will learn to connect with G-d in a deeper, more meaningful way. We will, as a society, come to realize that each day and each experience we have - however briefly - is actually a gift. We will learn simple gratitude.\nWe as a society will realize that the ‚Äúalmighty dollar‚Äù isn‚Äôt important. Not really. Not when you cannot breathe. As a result, we will learn to share and to give. To treat others as we‚Äôd hope to be treated.\nFor example, I found a list of some 300 EPA approved COVID-19 cleaning products. Most are NOT Clorox or Lysol, although they‚Äôre on the list too. Some are very much still available at regular prices. I searched the list and we actually had some of those products already in the house. I think most people probably will so there‚Äôs no reason to pay crazy prices for Lysol. (I would link it here but there‚Äôs a rule about adding links so if you just do a basic internet search for the list, you‚Äôll find it, it‚Äôs very easy to find.) It‚Äôs a public service list or something. Anyway, but I see eBay listings for ONE can of Lysol for $45,000! People believe that‚Äôs the only way they will live. How cruel and sad is that? I have cleaning products and know where to buy them but why should I be the only one who lives? What‚Äôs that passage about the meek? That‚Äôs why I posted the list instead of buying up all the products then trying to sell them. It‚Äôs my take that people will realize that it‚Äôs WRONG to try to profit from a pandemic and the pain that others experience and PEOPLE WILL DEVELOP EMPATHY.\nI believe this world will develop empathy as a result of this pandemic. Because as I said before, if you owned something that would save a life would you not share it? Hopefully, you would! That is why I share. I definitely don‚Äôt want to end up going to judgement and G-d saying, ‚Äúhope that $45,000 was worth your soul.‚Äù Just saying. I think people will learn to treat others with respect. Dignity.

I really had pulled myself out of a rough patch and I was proud. However; I didn‚Äôt realise how LONELY I was until my ENTJ came along.\nmy ENTJ, as cheesy as it‚Äôs going to sound showed me what love is. I‚Äôd never had anybody stay with me before, I had been conditioned by a very toxic INFJ to expect the absolute worst from people, leaving me with abandonment fears and tremendously horrific anxiety. It‚Äôs enough to make most people run.\nNot my ENTJ, she was patient and kind. She saw past the ENFP fuzzy warmth and ditzy smile and saw depth. She stood by me and held my hand when I broke down in tears apologising for how messy I was. She listened to my stories, how I saw things and was fascinated by it, she showed up each time I thought ‚Äò‚Äòthere‚Äôs no way‚Äô. She understood the reasons as to why I did things and she taught me about love selflessly, she pointed out when I was getting down on myself, she pulled me out of self destructive loops. Not in a way I was dependent on her; but in a way where she taught me I could do it; just by myself. I didn‚Äôt NEED to depend on her, but I could lean on her when times got tough.

It is like this - if we are thirsty, no amount of soda or drinks, hard or soft, can satisfy us - temporarily maybe, but ultimately we need water.\nA fickle person is just as much on his search for God as is a steady person. It is just that the fickle one has not found a close match to God and the steady one found somebody similar to his God. But all relative relationships will wither away some day or the other, because ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù is not ‚Äúsame‚Äù. Ultimately the heart and the soul will not tolerate any shortcoming in relationships. All these relationships in this world are like passengers on a train. If you like the person sitting beside you, you make a connection - a temporary one, otherwise you stay quiet. At the end of the journey everybody will disperse to their respective destinations. It would be foolish to give your heart to a person you just met in the train. We think we know a person by living with them for long, but what is a matter of hours in a train is the same as decades on this earth - by the end of the journey we are none the wiser about the other person.

Why? The reason is because being habituated to a stress response-the fight/flight/freeze response of that automatic brain- contributes greatly to our inability to access contentment and to be open and close with others and NeurOptimal works with that brainwave habit.\nLet me explain in greater detail. NeurOptimal neurofeedback software reads and is responsive in real time to the trainee‚Äôs brainwaves. It gives feedback through auditory cues when it wants that automatic functioning brain to pay attention to what it‚Äôs doing habitually.\nStress is a brain habit of assuming there is danger present when there is none. If there IS imminent danger then, yes, we want our brain to go on auto-pilot and punch, run or play dead to keep us alive. (That is the brain‚Äôs definition of danger: occurring NOW and life-threatening.)\nWhen not perceiving present danger, the brain is supposed to be in a state of regulation: calm, able to focus, feel peaceful, playful, responsive to present in an accurate way, breathing normally, sleeping when tired.\nWe know stress as not sleeping well, worrying too much, having a hard time feeling joy and resistance to wanting to open up to others.\nIn my 9 years of working with people using NeurOptimal there are two factors that contribute the most to success shifting out of stress.\nReadiness to be a different person. Wanting to change; being ready for change. People who walk into my office for neurofeedback and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to be less worried.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of being alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to feel joy again.‚Äù My guess as to why that is an important factor is because their thoughts won‚Äôt work against the reset will organically unfold as the brain sees its habits. As they calm down and cheer up, the mind response will be, ‚Äúyes!‚Äù rather than, ‚ÄúIs this OK, my worry is my safety net. I can‚Äôt let that go.‚Äù\nSeeing optimization or a positive reset of themselves as a holistic endeavor rather than a ‚Äúone-pill-wonder‚Äù approach. To reset out of our habitual patterns and help our brains rewire, and our mood improve, we need to employ many tools, not just one. In doing so, we create the overall environment supportive for health and well-being. Here are three key ones to have alongside neurofeedback training:\nEnough sleep. Stress also impacts quality of sleep so just starting your NeurOptimal with a good sleep hygiene routine is a good start. Give yourself 3 months to reset your sleep with the goal of 7‚Äì8 hours a night. The brain eliminates toxins at night while we sleep. Here‚Äôs a more in-depth blog and free sleep hygiene e-book I created.\nExercise. So important for helping the body and brain reset. 3‚Äì5 times a week, start with what‚Äôs doable and work up to it.\nEating a brain foods rich diet. Your brain needs the building blocks to improve itself. That includes foods high in omega-3s, and reducing foods that cause inflammation such as sugar, which messes with our guts, which is where important brain neurotransmitters (our happy chemicals) are made.', 'upvote': 2}}, 'create_time': 'Apr 5, 2020'}, '225': {'question_title': 'Does your first love usually determine your ‚Äútype‚Äù, or does it happen to coincide with your type?', 'question_author': 'Thomas Weaver', 'topic_list': [], 'answer_count': 1, 'no_of_view': '602', 'no_of_follower': 7, 'respond': {'0': {'user_name': 'Diya Gem', 'date': 'Apr 4, 2020', 'view': 101, 'answer': 'It happens to coincide with your type.\nThe remarkable thing I‚Äôve discovered is I had very set criteria for what I wanted in a partner.

Was this completely his idea? Is this something he really wanted to do? If this is the case and he made a mistake how was your nagging going to help? Nagging is not supporting someone who wants to make a change. It's like punishing the person for making the mistake.\nWhat I'm guessing is this is not the situation. I'm guessing you decided you didn't like him smoking and you want him to change his habit. I'm doubting you asked if he would consider it and accept his answer (especially if it was a no). I pressume you pressured him to make the promise not to smoke. Maybe you got overly emotional at him, maybe nagged, berated him with your concern. I'm guessing you kept the pressure on until you got your promise.\nWhen you pressure someone to make a promise this is not actually a promise. Just as if you pressure someone to say yes to something. This isn't consent. It is manipulation and controlling behaviour. The person gives in because in the moment it is easier to make the promise than deal with the argument. All you have done is worn the person down in which they will do anything to make it stop.\nThen when they change their mind, well actually being honest because they did not want to do what they said they would, you get upset and nag them. Things escalate and then an argument unfolds.\nYeah you are hurt by a false promise. They are feeling resentful because they feel controlled. This is not a healthy relationship dynamic.\nNow if smoking is a real issue for you then why are you with your boyfriend? Seriously? If smoking is a deal breaker then move on. If it's not a deal breaker then you need to learn to accept your boyfriend is a person not an object. Being a person means he has the capability to make his own decisions about himself even if they are a mistake. It's not your role to prevent him from making his own personal mistakes. It is your role to support him when he needs (and importantly asks for) help.\nWhat you should not do is nag your boyfriend in an attempt to have him fit your ideal boyfriend. It's unfair to place expectations and values on him that aren't his. It is not right, and really a waste of yout time, to try and mold him into your image. It is hard enough to chamge yourself. How can there be any hope for you to change someone else, especially if it isn't something they asked for.\nEither your values align or they don't. This is what it means to be compatible.

I just said to her that if she won‚Äôt try it, someone else will and she will lose her chance.\nYou always have NO as an answer. But if you‚Äôll ask, you can actually get YES.\nThe same evening she wrote him her first message on whatapp and asked him out.\n2 years later, they are married and 2 months ago they got their firstborn. They are really happy together and during all the time when they were dating as well as later when they got engaged and got married they shared so much happiness together, they supported each there, they found their places in the world and created something beautiful in their lives.\nI think it really doesn‚Äôt matter are you a boy or a girl. When it comes to crushes, sympathies, relationship..just give yourself a try. Yes, maybe 9 times out of 10 it won‚Äôt work out, maybe you‚Äôll feel stupid, maybe it will be a total disaster.

An answer that can‚Äôt be proved right or wrong, so all I have to offer is my opinion.\nNo, I don‚Äôt believe it is. Capitalism was never designed to be a scheme to protect health for once-in-a-century problems that only now with global air travel is much more likely to occur more often. The seeds of capitalism were growing long before airplanes were created. In fact, airplane technology is a result of capitalism, so the current global travel environment is also an offshoot of capitalism.\nThe method that most of society has been using to deal with problems of this nature was to put in place a team of experts on health and epidemiologists. The WHO (World Health Organization) is performing an adequate job for most of the world‚Äôs coordination in this issue. In the USA (where I am familiar with), we have the CDC, which can call on the help of FEMA, the US military, and other national organizations to provide assistance.\nWe have had a special White House team that coordinated with 40+ international offices that kept a lookout all over the globe for such problems. These experts developed detailed plans to handle as best as they could predict what was needed to be done quickly to fend off the next viral epidemic.\nSadly, Americans were conned into electing a president that knew nothing about science, management, or government, and had no interest in learning anything about these matters. Several years ago most of these offices were de-funded and closed out of ignorance. So the USA had no plan in place, no agency to handle the early warning signs, and no effective leadership. Combined with a refusal to do what needs to be done, our president had even to this day April 10, 2020, failed to place an experienced leader to handle this crisis.\nIf the country that could land a man on the moon could not manage this problem, it seems natural that less developed, less wealthy countries had as much of a chance to effectively manage this crisis. Some have minimized the problem very well (North Korea, Germany, and even China to some degree), most haven‚Äôt. I suspect it‚Äôs because most countries have leadership that is as incompetent as the USA has in handling difficult problems.\nSo the clear answer was that the current crisis in the USA and many other countries is and was a failure of government leadership in ways too numerous to mention. Capitalism is not to blame, it was not created for this type of crisis. Government is to blame, because the last administration was put in place only 3 years ago with the understanding that it would manage such a crisis.', 'upvote': 1}}, 'create_time': 'Apr 11, 2020'}, '847': {'question_title': 'error', 'question_author': None, 'topic_list': [], 'answer_count': 'error', 'no_of_view': 'error', 'no_of_follower': 'error', 'respond': {}, 'create_time': ''}, '359': {'question_title': 'My boyfriend‚Äôs mom is overbearing and it is taking a toll on our relationship.

He had a 3 year old daughter that lived in a separate state with her mother. Mind you when I met him he was in AIT in the Army and his actually family was scattered throughout two different states so as far as meeting anyone close to him that could call him out on his lie I didn‚Äôt have a chance. For a while things were amazing. He said that he had an amicable relationship with his child‚Äôs mother (They were never married‚Ä¶ Important for the later part of this story) Him and I were friends on each others social media and I never saw her comment or post on any of his stuff and when we were together his phone wasn‚Äôt ever blowing up to make me believe any different from what he was saying. Well fast forward to the end of his training when he finally moved to the base he would be stationed at‚Ä¶. He ended up getting stationed at Ft. Sill which was about 22 hours away from VA. We decided to keep the relationship going and worked out how we would get to visit each other and all that jazz. He left VA at the end of November/ beginning of December. He was at his home base for a short period of time before he let me know that he was going to be deployed to Korea soon and he wanted to see me before he deployed. I drove 22 hours straight to Oklahoma and saw him the week before and of Christmas. I left Oklahoma on the 22nd because I wanted to spend Christmas with my family and he said that he was going to be spending it with his daughter. Well during the time we were dating I can only guess that his childs mother figured out who I was or wanted to be nosy so I noticed that she had popped up under the ‚ÄúPeople you may know‚Äù on Facebook right at the top. I didn‚Äôt think much of it because I just assumed he had finally told her that we were dating since he ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù his family knew who I was as well. Well Christmas day I was on Facebook and doing my usual scrolling and ended up getting a friend request which prompted me to look at the ‚ÄúPeople you may know‚Äù since it is on the same screen and I saw that her last name had changed to his last name! I freaked out and I contacted him and went off! He said that she just had false hope and she was crazy and I shouldn‚Äôt go off of what I see on Facebook. I calmed down after a few days and we stayed together. Mind you there were other small hints in between this happening that I ignored but now looking back I see that I shouldn‚Äôt have‚Ä¶ Then a week or so later I start getting notifications from my Pinterest and of course I look to see that she was pinning things from my Pinterest to hers‚Ä¶ I chalked it up to being her being petty until I realized she had stuff posted showing that SHE MOVED IN WITH HIM! To make a long story short‚Ä¶ They were together the entire time and I was nothing more than a side piece.
